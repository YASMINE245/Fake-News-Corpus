{"text": "Even if you frequent St. Marks Church in the East Village, youve probably never been inside the Priests Room or walked around the second-floor balcony. Youve passed the lion statue guarding the entrance, but have you ever really looked at it?On Saturday night, Danspace Projects Platform 2016: A Body in Places, a series exploring work by the visionary dancer and choreographer Eiko, continued with a three-hour event that let visitors roam the building. Precarious I: Guest Solos sent eight soloists, Eiko included, dancing in and among the churchs spaces in thoughtful and mischievous ways. Eiko, whose own work deals vividly, sometimes mournfully, with slowness and stillness, brings out the best in her colleagues.The unofficial guest of honor was Koma, Eikos husband and artistic partner of more than 40 years. (Her solo endeavors are relatively recent.) Audience members huddled outside the front door to watch his delightfully disheveled Dancing With My Painting and Lion, which found him staggering through a thin layer of sand in tattered pink satin shoes. A canvas hanging from the churchyards fence, lowered at the start and later resurrected, framed his exploits: a tender encounter with the lion by the door; his near escape as he scaled the fence and howled in the direction of 10th Street.In the sanctuary you could find Beth Gill sliding and slumping along the carpeted risers and altar, as if she were part-riser herself. (Her brilliant costume matched the carpet in color and texture.) This meditative exercise, Precarious Landscapes, lasted nearly the entire three hours, allowing viewers to pop in between other, shorter solos, most of which repeated each hour.In the Parish Hall, the choreographer Donna Uchizono served tea between Jimena Pazs quietly ravishing showings of a dance she learned 25 years ago in Argentina, or her recollection of it. Its delicate unfurling lured me back for a second viewing. Along a stretch of balcony, Neil Greenberg also looked back with a composite of his previous works  Not-About-AIDS Dance, The Disco Project and others  by turns boisterous and introspective.The solos overlapped serendipitously. From the sanctuary, Polly Motleys voice could be heard wafting through the building. (Her solo was a singing, wandering one.) During Arturo Vidichs wonderfully bizarre Alone in the Dark  which felt like a medieval ritual in the crowded, shadowy Priests Room  Eiko, nomadic throughout the night, blew in through the doors. Crouched among Mr. Vidichs sound and lighting contraptions, barely moving, she lit up the space."}
{"text": "Claude Parent, the French architectural visionary who in the 1950s broke with his traditional Beaux-Arts training and then orthodox Modernism to take a radical course, designing buildings on the oblique instead of the vertical and horizontal, died on Saturday in Paris. He was 93.His daughter, Chlo Parent, said he died at a hospital after his heart had stopped while he was being fitted for a pacemaker. He had celebrated his birthday on Friday.His quiet demeanor, impeccable manners, Issey Miyake jackets and white Rolls-Royce all belied the fact that Mr. Parent (roughly pronounced pah-RAHN) was an instinctive subversive  though a highly successful one, not unlike more conspicuous French rebels like the writer Jean Genet and the artist Yves Klein, with whom Mr. Parent frequently collaborated.Mr. Parent subverted convention from the beginning of his practice, when he and a fellow Beaux-Arts student won a magazine-sponsored competition in 1952 to design and build a house. They created a long, low, California-inspired dream house and then fractured it, breaking the horizontal lines abruptly with a massive wall. The house lost its unity, a radical idea then and now.With the encouragement of the Parisian sculptor Andr Bloc, who was the influential editor of the magazine Architecture dAujourdhui, Mr. Parent collaborated with many artists, importing ideas from painting and sculpture into a field that usually follows the logic of its own closed system. He broke open solids to achieve plasticity, like a sculptor, and he introduced color in bold patterns, like an abstract artist.His collaboration with Mr. Klein taught him to cultivate the void: In drawings they speculated about building wall-free environments of moving air, with beds cushioned by pulsing air jets in open-air rooms enclosed by air curtains under forced-air roofs and comfortable environments powered by air-conditioners hidden below ground.Their drawings depicted buildings that effectively vaporized, much like filmy, see-through Minimalist glass structures done by the avant-garde today. In a field often characterized by caution, Mr. Klein represented a wild part of my life, Mr. Parent once told an interviewer. The deliriousness of his utopia seized me.In 1957, with Mr. Bloc, he designed the Caf du Rond Point on the Champs-Elyses, a walk-through painting-sculpture with a ceiling of angled and tilted planes blithely floating above the escargots and steak-frites. They painted the planes in a palette of neutrals accented with a vivid red.Mr. Parent introduced dynamic instability into the most solid of objects: a building. In 1963, for example, under the influence of the abstract de Stijl artists of the Netherlands, he broke off the living room of a flat-roofed two-story villa he designed in Versailles  the Villa Drusch  and glazed its cube-shaped concrete frame, which he then tilted 45 degrees so that the cube teetered on its edge.Mr. Parents interest in dynamic instability matured fully in collaboration with the cultural theorist Paul Virilio, with whom he practiced in the firm Architecture Principe from 1963 to 1968. A student of World War II German bunkers, Mr. Virilio deepened Mr. Parents interest in instability by introducing him to abandoned bunkers that seemed to surf down the sandy embankments of Europes Atlantic Wall.For Mr. Virilio, the bunkers interior environment was troubling because of the vertigo its tilted walls and sloping floors provoked. But vertigo is wonderful! Mr. Parent said, as he recalled in an interview last year. I have to see it!The tilted bunkers, with their pulling-and-pushing effects on the body, inspired their design for a church in Nevers, Ste. Bernadette du Banlay, which was consecrated in 1966. The building is a concrete hexagonal structure with rounded corners that Mr. Parent and Mr. Virilio split in half to allow light in.Inside, in the 400-seat sanctuary on the second floor, the two halves of the floor, front and back, slope up at different degrees. Rather than trooping to the altar for communion on a Sunday morning, congregants would immediately feel the gentle push and pull of gravity. Space in the building was active, not passive. Priests discovered that coffins would slide off gurneys. Nuns were not amused.Mr. Parent and Mr. Virilio formalized their approach after the churchs construction, naming it the Function of the Oblique, and in 1966 issued a manifesto, Architecture Principe.Parent and Virilio were proposing a new idea of space that broke from the traditional rationalist idea of space open for any inscription drawn into it, Frdric Migayrou, deputy director of the Centre Pompidous architecture department, said in an interview on Sunday. Their space was defined by the body in movement. In the 60s and 70s, fighting for this meant crazy, incredible combat, but they changed the rules, and opened a new field of thought for architecture.To study the effects of the oblique, Mr. Parent and Mr. Virilio devised a pair of long, bent cabins suspended 10 meters (or about 33 feet) in the air, each half swinging like a pendulum. Their idea was to live in the cabins under the observation of physiologists and psychologists. But the student rebellion of May 1968 forced them to abort the experiment, and the partners eventually split. After the rebellion, Mr. Virilio wanted to politicize the practice; Mr. Parent wanted to practice the oblique without politics.Mr. Parent went on to build an apparent oxymoron: transgressive shopping centers. His GEM Commercial Center at Sens of 1970 looks like a concrete submarine emerging from the sea, with a pedestrian circulation pattern of switchback corridors, all on the oblique, climbing the front facade.At a time when France had begun a modernization program that included the supersonic jet the Concorde, the high-speed TGV train and the Pompidou Center, the utility company Electricit de France hired Mr. Parent to advise on the design of nuclear power plants.The company sought an architect who could assuage public fears about nuclear powers impact on the environment with designs that integrated plants into the landscape. (Mr. Parent designed two of them, and he was an advising director on many others.) Many of the huge, parabolic-shaped concrete silos that can be seen today in France resemble Brancusi sculptures, reduced to a smooth and dynamic essence.The project was opposed by many on Frances political left and in the countrys emerging ecological movement, but Mr. Parent felt compelled to accept the reality that nuclear power represented the future. His reputation suffered for it.Mr. Parent closed his office in the early 2000s. But he continued to pursue his visions graphically, producing hundreds of drawings in which he applied his theories of the oblique to panoramas of utopian cities and territories, always populated by figures, to show the effect of his ramped architecture on the body and on populations.Objecting to the vertical city, he imagined inclined sites, oblique cities where inhabitants, like mountain dwellers, essentially live on slopes in a new organization of space based on health and the pleasure of the body in movement, said the architect Jean Nouvel, a protg of Mr. Parents. (He dedicated his recent design of the Paris Philharmonic to Mr. Parent.)Bernard Tschumi, a former dean of the Columbia architecture school, who has offices in New York and Paris, said of Mr. Parent: He was not a marginal figure, but a figure who worked in the margins, in an avant-garde outside the mainstream genealogy of the Modern movement. He played an enormous role, and showed that alternative practices are possible.Claude Parent was born on Feb. 26, 1923, in the Paris suburb Neuilly sur Seine. His father, Hypolite Parent, was an aeronautical designer and engineer, and his mother, Marie-Jos Bintrui, owned and ran a modern furniture store.Mr. Parents first marriage, to Therse Houdart, ended in divorce in 1958. He married Bernadette Goulet the next year. She survives him, as do his children, Franois, Florence and Chlo; his sister, Nicole Parent; and four grandchildren.As his career wound down, Mr. Parents reputation paradoxically grew. His church in Nevers, a succs de scandal when it was completed, was declared a national historic monument in 1990; so was his commercial center in Sens, in 2011.In 2009, Mr. Migayrou curated a major retrospective of Mr. Parents built and drawn work, inaugurating a new museum in Paris, the Cit de lArchitecture et du Patrimoine.Largely through Mr. Migayrous initiatives, Mr. Parent and his Oblique Function were introduced to a young generation of architects adopting the computer as a design tool.With his sloped floors and inclined walls, he was there first  he was a key figure for my generation, said Greg Lynn, 51, a pioneer of computer-generated architecture and author of the groundbreaking book Animate Form. Mr. Lynn and others of his generation have developed the oblique on their screens, building the continuous topographies and fluid form and space that Mr. Parent introduced.He was a vibrant thinker, Frank Gehry, the Los Angeles architect, who met Mr. Parent as a 30-year-old working in Paris, said on Sunday. He wasnt worried about what was going on around him in normal practices, and he didnt belong to any group. He was unabashedly himself. And his drawings were extraordinary  beautiful fantasies, full of poetry."}
{"text": "Of all the patients I have seen in my 40 years as a psychoanalyst, Daniel was the strangest. He was the most inaccessible, inwardly tormented and infuriating man I have ever known, and yet he stayed in therapy with me for over a decade, calling faithfully every week  he insisted that his work schedule precluded coming in person  even though he spent many of those sessions in silence or addressed me as if I were inanimate. He drove me crazy, he haunted me and he moved me, sometimes all in the same session.The reason he came to me was simple. He wanted, as he put it, to become a participant in the human race, and to learn how to relate to others of his species. I was hired to teach him how to do it.Daniel initially chose me for this job because he had read a book I wrote about problem siblings that resonated with his own childhood. He had been terrorized by his older brothers daily violent outbursts, which his parents had done nothing to contain, and had concluded early on that relationships offered no comfort or satisfaction, merely depletion and misery.Needing or being needed by anyone seemed perilous to Daniel. He barely exchanged a word at work with colleagues whom hed known for years, and his home, which he shared with his extraordinarily longsuffering wife (who had problems of her own), had the air of a monastery, where words were exchanged only by necessity.Daniel rarely followed through on anything I recommended: having brief conversations by appointment with his wife, going to the company cafeteria, keeping a journal of his thoughts, emailing me between sessions. He would always agree to try, and then find excuses or forget the assignment.After nine years of this, I was at my wits end. The only thing that kept me going when I lost hope of ever getting through to Daniel was that occasionally he spoke with real feeling about the depth of his loneliness, and his dread that he would never find a way out of the bunker he had constructed to keep himself safe.Then one day, I got an idea. There was another inhabitant of Daniels household  Jeff  whom I learned of only years after Daniel and I began therapy, because Jeff was so little a part of his consciousness. Jeff was a dog of an unusual breed that Daniels wife doted on and that he utterly ignored, never feeding, petting or walking.My idea was to enlist Jeff as my co-therapist to help Daniel break through his isolation. I proposed to Daniel that he take some responsibility for Jeffs care, preparing and feeding him dinner daily  his wife would continue to do the morning shift while he was at work  and that he observe his emotions as he did so.The plan actually piqued Daniels interest, since no talking was involved and the encounters would not require as much from him as human contact would. He agreed to make a serious effort.Every session thereafter I asked for a progress report. Im doing O.K. with it, Daniel invariably said, but on closer examination it always turned out that there were gaps in his fulfillment of his obligation that he glossed over and then rationalized away. I didnt do it yesterday because there was a TV show around dinner time I didnt want to miss, he might say, or I was out of town or I went running.The task itself, which seemed simplicity itself to me  at feeding time, open can, fill bowl, wash bowl  proved herculean for Daniel. The sticking point, as we both had anticipated, was reliability. Daniel would have to provide things for Jeff  consideration and support  that nobody had ever given him.Still, I refused to let Daniel off the hook. You cant just assume that your wife will take up the slack, I cautioned him. Jeff still has to be fed every single night on schedule, just like you do. Now he depends on you for survival  you have to keep his needs in mind and provide for them.He chafed at this, but he took it to heart.Then one day, Daniel made an announcement that surprised me as much as it surprised him. Today I heard the dog eating, he said. I noticed it. I liked it. This was the first time that Daniel could recall having ever been pleased, rather than threatened, by being aware of the presence of another. For a man who by his own account rushed through every social interaction, unable to savor it, this was remarkable.Jeff was more forgiving of Daniels derelictions than I was. And as Daniel became a more reliable, even if far from perfect, master, Jeff  whom Daniel never called by name  took notice, wagging his tail at Daniels approach. The dog just jumped up and laid down by my feet, he reported with unconcealed delight one session. Its a wonderful thing. I have an effect on others.This was the first time I had heard joy in Daniels voice. Jeffs expression of gratitude, responsiveness and appreciation made Daniels efforts feel worthwhile to him. Feeding your dog is feeding your soul, feeding your humanity, I said, and Daniel responded with a striking reformulation of the same thought: Im only fed when Im feeding.The next session, Daniel reported another milestone. Today, he said, the dog and I looked each other in the eye. I suggested that he start to call Jeff by his name, to indicate that they had a mutual relationship.There were signs of real love developing between Daniel and Jeff. I miss it when I dont feed the dog, Daniel said one day. Hes so happy to see me. Im becoming part of his life. I pat his belly and stroke his head.There were still limits to Daniels engagement. He had yet to take Jeff for a walk, for example. But I left the two of them alone to work out that issue at their own pace. I tried to be as patient with Daniel as Jeff was.Finally, one night, unprompted, Daniel took a leap of faith. He turned to his wife after dinner and said: Im lonely. I havent treated you well or thought about you for all these years. I was too afraid to let myself care about anything or anybody, but I know you care about me. I want to make it up to you.She reached for his hand.Then he took her for a walk.Jeanne Safer, a psychoanalyst in New York, is the author of six books, including the forthcoming The Golden Condom and Other Essays on Love Lost and Found.Details have been altered to protect patient privacy."}
{"text": "Amid generally positive reviews of his jabs at Hollywood and #OscarsSoWhite, the host of Sundays Oscar ceremony, Chris Rock, is being taken to task for some of his material involving Asian-Americans.Introducing the accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers, which tabulates the vote results, Mr. Rock instead brought onstage two boys and a girl of Asian heritage, whom he named Ming Zu, Bao Ling and David Moskowitz. As they clutched briefcases, they visually illustrated the stereotype that Asians are diligent workers who excel at math.If anybodys upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone that was also made by these kids, Mr. Rock added, a punch line interpreted as a reference to child labor in Asia.But that seeming awareness of how fine the line was between satire and slur, only added insult to injury, Lowen Liu wrote on the Slate site. Even if the second beat tries to turn things around, it still allows the teller to make an Asian joke and then excuse himself from the telling. He pulls the rug out from under the audience only to hide underneath it. (Sacha Baron Cohen, in character as Ali G, later also made a swipe  involving Minions and little yellow people  that many found offensive.)Constance Wu, the Fresh Off the Boat actress, tweeted her disappointment: To parade little kids on stage w/no speaking lines merely to be the butt of a racist joke is reductive & gross, she wrote.So did the actor Jeffrey Wright, who tweeted that the joke needed recalibrating, among other more stringent comments.In a new study, the University of Southern California Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism found that at least half of the movies, television and streaming series released over the last two years had no speaking or named Asian-American characters; when they are represented, it is rarely in leading roles.Even well-known Asian-American actors like Ken Jeong are still asked to do stereotypical accents, as he and others detailed in a recent New York Times story. Its getting a little bit better, but its just not great, Mr. Jeong said of onscreen representation. We have a ways to go.Asian and Asian-American performers, like the South Korean actor Lee Byung-hun and the TV star Mindy Kaling, were on hand as Oscar presenters or prominent guests on Sunday. And the academy president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, called on her colleagues to take action because our audiences are global and rich in diversity, and every facet of our industry should be as well. But many critics said Mr. Rocks jokes seemed like a missed opportunity to highlight the fact that inclusion goes beyond black and white. (There were no jokes aimed at Latinos, but there was also no indication by the awards show that they were proportionately missing from the big screen, though the statistics say they are.)The actor Daniel Dae Kim tweeted that the first reference to any ethnicity other than black took 30 minutes, when someone mentions pho. I thought #diversity was more than that.As the writer Mina Kimes noted on Twitter, the joke  wouldve stung less if there were more Asians on stage tonight.In response to the ceremony, the writer Jaya Sundaresh created her own social media movement, urging followers to use #onlyonepercent to reflect the fact that Asian Americans have recd only 1% of Oscar noms in its history.An antidote to the one-liners came from the Pakistani journalist and filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy, who picked up her second Oscar for documentary short, this time for A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness, a film about an 18-year-old girl who survived an attempted honor killing, only to see her attackers set free.The Pakistani prime minister said he would change the law on honor killings after watching her film, Ms. Obaid Chinoy said in her acceptance speech. Thats the power of film."}
{"text": "As Chris Rock strolled onto the Dolby Theater stage Sunday night and prepared to lay waste to the Academy Awards, there was a hint of what was to come in the music playing in the background: Public Enemys Fight the Power.In an Oscars ceremony full of sly jokes told with baldfaced abandon, this was perhaps the most audacious. And in a year in which the conversation about Hollywoods systemic problems with diversity was far louder than the conversation about the quality of its product, this was a wise choice and a knowing provocation. It was a loud reminder that even though it was the academys night, control of the tone belonged to Mr. Rock, and he could bend it to his will.And Fight the Power, a punishingly catchy anti-establishment anthem by the most vocal political hip-hop act of all time, is good theme music for an assault from within.Originally written at the behest of Spike Lee for his 1989 film, Do the Right Thing, Fight the Power is built on a splatter of samples, furious scratches by Terminator X and the saxophone playing of Branford Marsalis, chopped into siren bursts. Chuck Ds speechifying is pugnacious and mesmerizing, accented by Flavor Flavs urgent exhortations.In the film, Fight the Power shrieks out of Radio Raheems boombox  a warning or a nuisance, depending on whos doing the listening. (It later appeared on Public Enemys 1990 album, Fear of a Black Planet, and was nominated for best rap performance at the 1990 Grammy Awards, losing to Young M.C.s Bust a Move.) Mr. Lee, who was nominated for the Do the Right Thing screenplay at the 1990 Oscars but lost to Tom Schulmans Dead Poets Society, also directed the songs music video, which took the form of a political rally in the streets of Brooklyn.Last November, before this years nominees were announced, Mr. Lee won an Academy Honorary Award  the only Oscar hes ever received  and used his acceptance speech to decry Hollywoods pervasive diversity problems. He declined to appear at Sundays ceremony as an act of protest. (He instead attended the Knicks game in a tuxedo.)But with Fight the Power, Mr. Lee was there in spirit, at the beginning of the night and also the end when, notably, almost the entire song played as the credits scrolled. It should be said: Yes, the song faded out before its third verse, the one that bad-mouths Elvis Presley and John Wayne, still-sacred totems of white American virility. And some of the sampled bits that gave it additional urgency in its time were gone. Questlove, hip-hops living memory, bemoaned the changes on Twitter: Confused at this new version of Fight the Power, minus 6 crucial samples  and its all too important middle finger of a last verse.Had Fight the Power been co-opted? Chuck D spent some of Sunday night debating people on Twitter who felt that way. But the way the song bookended the ceremony couldnt help but feel like a moral victory. If it came about as a result of Mr. Rocks exerting his influence as host to make sure that insurgency had a voice, then fine.If it was a stroke of self-awareness on the part of the Academy, even better. Maybe next year, theyll go for Burn Hollywood Burn."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Amy Brenneman, an actress, wants Justice Anthony M. Kennedy to know about the abortion she had when she was a 21-year-old college junior.Taking a page from the movement for same-sex marriage, Ms. Brenneman and more than 100 other women have filed several supporting briefs in a major Supreme Court abortion case to be argued on Wednesday. The briefs tell the stories of women who say their abortions allowed them to control their bodies, plan for the future and welcome children into their lives when their careers were established and their personal lives were on solid ground.The briefs are aimed largely at Justice Kennedy, who holds the crucial vote in abortion cases. They use language and concepts from his four major gay rights decisions, notably his invocation of equal dignity in Junes ruling establishing a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.Why has marriage equality gained so much ground, and reproductive justice seems to be losing so much ground? Ms. Brenneman, known for her roles on NYPD Blue and Judging Amy, said in an interview. Partly, she said, because gay couples have come out of the shadows but many women still believe abortions to be shameful secrets.The briefs seek to counter that, as well as what some people saw as a streak of uninformed paternalism in a 2007 majority opinion in which Justice Kennedy said many women regretted their decisions to have abortions and experienced depression and plunging self-esteemBut Allan E. Parker Jr., a lawyer with the anti-abortion group the Justice Foundation, said the womens briefs may only alienate Justice Kennedy.The abortion industry is trying to make it sound like abortion is a joyful experience, he said. But even women who say it was necessary say it was not joyful. It is a grief and a blackness, and it changes you.Mr. Parker filed a brief on behalf of more than 3,000 women, many identified by their first names or initials, who say they suffered psychological or physical harm from their abortions.Because abortion is such a difficult and painful decision, the brief said, the initial reaction may be relief because the trauma of the actual event is over and the decision making process is over, but that may sow the seeds of trauma and emotional injury that lasts for decades.Helen J. Knowles, the author of The Tie Goes to Freedom: Justice Anthony M. Kennedy on Liberty, said she had her doubts about appealing to Justice Kennedy by using personal stories.I suspect that taking that approach is not going to get much traction with Justice Kennedy, she said. Im just not convinced that this is the right way to come at him in this case.The better approach, one taken in many other briefs, she said, is to focus on the obstacles created by the Texas law rather than on general conceptions of motherhood.Wednesdays case, Whole Womans Health v. Hellerstedt, No. 15-274, concerns a challenge to a restrictive Texas law brought by several abortion clinics in the state. They say the law could reduce the number of clinics in Texas to about 10 from roughly 40 by requiring doctors who perform abortions to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and requiring clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgical centers.The courts balance of power has shifted with the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but abortion rights advocates will almost certainly still have to secure Justice Kennedys vote to win the case. A 4-to-4 tie would automatically affirm an appeals court decision that sustained the restrictions with minor exceptions.Justice Kennedys abortion jurisprudence is muddled.In 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, he joined Justices Sandra Day OConnor and David H. Souter in a joint opinion that reaffirmed the core of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.At the heart of liberty is the right to define ones own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life, the joint opinion said, in a passage that only Justice Kennedy could have drafted.But Justice Kennedys reputation as an abortion rights champion is undeserved, said David S. Cohen, a law professor at Drexel University. He has only once found an abortion restriction unconstitutional in his 28 years on the Supreme Court, Professor Cohen said, while allowing 20 other restrictions to go into effect.In 2007, Justice Kennedy wrote the majority opinion upholding the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, supplementing his legal analysis with observations about motherhood.Respect for human life finds an ultimate expression in the bond of love the mother has for her child, he wrote, adding: While we find no reliable data to measure the phenomenon, it seems unexceptionable to conclude some women come to regret their choice to abort the infant life they once created and sustained. Severe depression and loss of esteem can follow.Janice Mac Avoy, a lawyer with Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson, said the passage troubled her. It was incredibly paternalistic, she said.She told her story in a brief signed by 113 female lawyers who said they did not regret their abortions.I was 18 years old, in high school, outside of St. Louis, Ms. Mac Avoy said in an interview. I was about to be the first person in my family to graduate from high school. And I had a scholarship to college, and I knew that I wanted to go to law school. And I knew that being a mother was not compatible with any of those things at that time in my life.Ms. Brenneman also said Justice Kennedys musings about regret were misguided.It is patronizing, she said. It is saying that women are not capable of knowing their own mental health. And 95 percent of women do not regret it, so this is an opportunity to set the math straight.In her own case, Ms. Brenneman said she was a 21-year-old junior at Harvard when her birth control failed and she had an abortion. It allowed me to choose when to become a mother, she said. As a mother now, I know I was correct at 21.I didnt have a college degree, she said. I didnt have an income. I didnt have a marriage. I didnt have anything a child needs. And I didnt want it.Professor Cohen, who has filed a brief supporting the Texas clinics, said the womens briefs were unusual in focusing on real-life narratives.They are not addressing any legal principle but are trying to get inside Justice Kennedys head that women are moral agents who make decisions and that regret is not something that should be part of his thinking, Professor Cohen said. It was clearly part of his thinking in 2007.Michael J. Dell, a lawyer with Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel who represents Ms. Brenneman and other women, said it was worth reminding the justices that abortions are common.There shouldnt be a stigma, he said. A third of women have abortions. Many of the people that Supreme Court justices know and socialize with, and their children and friends, have had abortions, and theyre probably totally unaware of it.Alexia D. Korberg, a lawyer with Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison who represents the female lawyers, said her work on a major gay rights case had informed the legal strategy in the abortion case.We had seen just how powerful humanizing issues that can seem abstract can be, not just for the justices but for everyone, and how powerful empathy can be, Ms. Korberg said.However effective such an approach may be, much of the attention at the Supreme Court on Wednesday will be focused on Justice Kennedy, as often happens and for good reason. One mans perception of abortion is what matters the most here, Professor Cohen said."}
{"text": "A specific condition afflicts business travelers: Call it hotel gloom, an amorphous melancholy that seems to thrive in the perfectly serviceable hotel rooms of the $200-a-night-and-under variety. Al Jackson has experienced it many times.Mr. Jackson, 38, a stand-up comedian who has been touring for more than a decade, has stayed in Red Roof Inns and Wyndham hotels across this land. Inserting his key card can be like a gateway to existential dread. When you open the door, theres that rush of air, always that same kind of stale smell, he said. Sometimes the door shuts behind you. Youre in this semidark room. You drag your bag to where everyone sets their bag and its, How did I get here again?The hospitality industry tries its best to counteract this adult version of homesickness. Everything about the guest experience, from the smooth jazz playing in the lobby to the earth-tone dcor, is designed to create a veneer of contentment and belonging. But hotel gloom has recently slipped into the cultural conversation nonetheless.First there was Hotels of North America, a novel published last fall by Rick Moody told in the form of online lodging reviews. Then came Anomalisa, the Oscar-nominated animated film written and co-directed by Charlie Kaufman, which centers on a businessmans stay in an upscale Cincinnati hotel that Tad Friend, writing about the movie in The New Yorker, described as oppressively functional. (Picture the best Hampton Inn youve ever stayed in.)Curiously, both the novel and the movie center on drifting middle-aged motivational speakers. They use the hotel stay as a metaphor for emotional estrangement and societal disconnectedness. Its a dark night of the soul rendered through free continental breakfasts and nightly turndown service.I used to stay in this Radisson in New London, Conn., Mr. Moody said. I still have nightmares about the Edward Hopper-esque loneliness.He spoke of the dread of the key being demagnetized and the mounting anxiety that whatever little shred of home or idea of home that you can carry into that room will be lost. In this way, Mr. Moody, 54, resembles his novels narrator, who, while staying at a La Quinta Inn in Tuscaloosa, Ala., undergoes a profound personality change brought on by the hotels nauseating pastels and faux-Mexican dcor.Perhaps the artistic temperament is not suited to hotel life. The cartoonist Charles M. Schulz told his biographer: Just the mention of a hotel makes me turn cold. When Im in a hotel room alone, I worry about getting so depressed I might jump out of a window.Carol Margolis, 56, has spent 30 years fighting off hotel gloom. She traveled frequently as a consultant for large corporations, once spending so much time on the road that she had a permanent room at a Marriott Residence Inn in Cleveland. Now she advises companies about business travel.For her, Rule No. 1: Never let the gloom gain a foothold. I was afraid that if it happened once, it would keep happening, she said. Its kind of like one drink and you fall off the wagon.For Ms. Margolis, who is married and lives in Florida, the problem is not the travel itself. She loves to walk down the jet bridge and board a plane, and the feeling of touching down on a runway a thousand miles from home promises new experiences, new adventures. The challenge comes later in the journey.When you get to the hotel, the movement stops, she said. Im picturing myself standing in the middle of the room, walking in circles asking, What do I do now?In recent years, the better chains have upgraded their designs, adding amenities like spas and fitness centers and making an effort to create a consistent experience across their properties. Yet, paradoxically, the quasi luxury may add to the sense of emptiness.Mr. Jackson sees the midprice chain hotel as a social leveler. Although he is grateful that he doesnt have to go back to the ratty motels he experienced early in his career, he said he wonders how far he has really come when he finds himself in yet another taupe-carpeted room.You fly first class, youre blue chip at the rental car counter, you go through the platinum rewards member line at the hotel, but youre still in that same lonely hotel room, Mr. Jackson said. No matter how ordered you try to make it, you have chosen a seminomadic lifestyle.How do seasoned business travelers fight it off? Bill McGowan, 55, the founder and chief executive of Clarity Media Group, a New York-based firm that specializes in media training, said he minimizes the amount of time spent in the room, cutting it down to unpacking, showering and sleeping.Room service is out; instead, he uses the Open Table app to find a restaurant with a lively bar where he can sit and have dinner, and eats there again on successive business trips.Routine can breed comfort, he added. He is on the road eight to 10 days a month and books the same hotels in the same cities. In Silicon Valley, its the Westin in Palo Alto, Calif. Its so familiar, its almost like a home away from home, Mr. McGowan said. I dont really have that horrible realization when I open the door.Ms. Margolis is also a believer in cutting down on the time spent in the room. Soon after check-in, she seeks a spot where she can work or relax. I recently stayed at a Marriott Courtyard, she said, and they have these bistro lobbies with a fireplace and chairs. Oh, my gosh, I was right there.Sarah Cloninger, 35, a corporate trainer who writes a travel blog called Road Warriorette, said that fighting the gloom starts with the trip planning. She arranges to be away from her husband and three small children the least amount of time possible. And she tries to book a hotel downtown, within walking distance of shops and restaurants. Its easier to feel bummed when youre in a Hampton Inn in the middle of nowhere, she said.Like many business travelers, Ms. Cloninger tends to stay in midprice chain hotels because they are company approved, and because she gets reward points. (She prefers Hilton chains.) But on the rare occasion when she is booked at a five-star hotel, like the time her company held a meeting at the Ritz-Carlton Half Moon Bay in Northern California, the gloom magically disappears.The bathroom had marble floors and gorgeous amenities and a separate bathtub, she said. I was not sad when I walked into that hotel room.Mr. Jackson, the comedian, sees an upside in the near silence of those midprice hotels with carpeted hallways and tinted windows that dont open. I want my hotel to be kind of sad, he said. I can get some work done.And given his vivid memories of the rundown places he once stayed in, he will take bourgeois melancholy any day.It was a motel in Vero Beach, Fla., he said. I walked into the room, and there was a gunshot through the window and ants all over the floor. I called the front desk and told them about the ants. The guy goes, You can come down here and pick up some spray.There is gloom, and then there is gloom."}
{"text": "After Eric Staal told his family he had been traded to the Rangers, Levi Staal, who is 4 years old and is the second of Eric and Tanya Staals three sons, told Eric time after time that he did not want his father to move away. Eric assured Levi that he would not be leaving North Carolina without him.The family, including 6-year-old Parker and 1-year-old Finley, arrived late Sunday in New York, and the Rangers provided the children with team sweaters with E. Staal and his jersey number, 12. Staal then took to Madison Square Gardens ice Monday night for his Rangers debut, a 2-1 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets.Staal, the center of a line that included Oscar Lindberg and Kevin Hayes, played 15 minutes 48 seconds, failing to score on one shot but winning nine of 17 face-offs. The Rangers won on Derek Stepans short-handed goal with 2 minutes 48 seconds remaining.Rangers goaltender Antti Raanta, playing instead of Henrik Lundqvist, preserved the victory by making a pad save on Columbus forward Cam Atkinson with less than a second left in regulation. The Blue Jackets knocked in the rebound, but time had expired.The ref was waving it off, and everybody was skating toward me, Raanta, who made 26 saves, said of his teammates.As far as Staal could recall, it was the first game in which his brother Marc, a 29-year-old Rangers defenseman, was his teammate. But Eric Staal had left behind another brother, 27-year-old Jordan, with the Carolina Hurricanes.Eric Staal made it clear that he did not waive the no-trade clause in his contract just because he thought it would be nice to play on the same team as Marc. Ten years have passed since he helped the Hurricanes win the Stanley Cup, and seven since his last playoff game. It has been a long wait.Having Marc here, obviously, is an extra benefit, Eric Staal said at a news conference at the Garden after the morning skate and a power-play meeting, but if he wasnt, this is still a great spot for me at this moment of my career.Eric Staal, 31, had played his entire 12-year N.H.L. career with the Hurricanes, becoming the teams captain and earning a reputation for his durability, but his contract was set to expire at the end of this season, and Staal said he knew deep down that the team would move on.So he provided Carolina General Manager Ron Francis with a shortlist of teams for which he would waive his no-trade clause, and the Rangers were on it. The Rangers sent two draft picks and a prospect, Aleksi Saarela, to Carolina to use Staal for 20 games and the playoffs.He wasnt going to come here if he didnt think we had the kind of team that could make a deep run in the playoffs, Marc Staal said Monday. Hes missed the playoffs the last six years, and hes been hungry to get back in.The Rangers (37-20-6) opened Monday with the second-best record in the Eastern Conference, and, according to the Sports Club Stats website, had a 99.1 percent chance of qualifying for the playoffs. So it appears as if Staal will satisfy that hunger.But the Washington Capitals (45-12-4), with the best record in not only the Metropolitan Division and the East but also the entire N.H.L., appear to be miles ahead of the Rangers. If they outpace the Islanders, the Rangers will most likely meet the Capitals in the postseasons second round.Playing two rounds hardly qualifies as a deep playoff run, especially for the Rangers, who have been to the conference finals in three of the past four years. By acquiring Staal and declining to trade defenseman Keith Yandle, Rangers management appeared to set the teams playoff lineup.Its a great sign that theyre willing to risk a little of the future to hopefully win now, said defenseman Ryan McDonagh, the Rangers captain.Because forward Jesper Fast called in sick Monday and the trade deadline loomed at 3 p.m., Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault did not say before the game precisely how he planned to use Eric Staal. But Vigneault said he would be counting heavily on Staal. He had won 53.7 of his face-offs this season, a better clip than the teams top two centers, Derick Brassard and Stepan. Staal can also be used on the power play and to kill penalties.It was important to send a message to our group that we believe in them and that we have faith in them, Vigneault said.Staal, however, had only 10 goals in 63 games with the Hurricanes this season. He played his first N.H.L. game on Oct. 9, 2003, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, and 909 N.H.L. regular-season games would grind anyone down.But, said Marc Staal, Hes got 10 years left in him.Eric Staal added: I feel like Im a young guy. It goes so fast. I feel like Ive got a lot of hockey life left in me.He said he planned to focus not on a new contract but on fitting in with the Rangers. Even if it was 10 years ago, his Cup-winning experience will be appreciated by a Rangers roster with only two players who have their names on the Stanley Cup: Dan Boyle and Viktor Stalberg.The Hurricanes were not going to get back to the playoffs this year. With Marc Staal and the Rangers, Eric Staal has another chance.The group of players they have, theyre battle-tested, theyve played big games, Eric Staal said, adding, They havent gotten it done yet, but theyre very close."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON  The federal Medicare program and private health insurers waste nearly $3 billion every year buying cancer medicines that are thrown out because many drug makers distribute the drugs only in vials that hold too much for most patients, a group of cancer researchers has found.The expensive drugs are usually injected by nurses working in doctors offices and hospitals who carefully measure the amount needed for a particular patient and then, because of safety concerns, discard the rest.If drug makers distributed vials containing smaller quantities, nurses could pick the right volume for a patient and minimize waste. Instead, many drug makers exclusively sell one-size-fits-all vials, ensuring that many smaller patients pay thousands of dollars for medicine they are never given, according to researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, who published a study on Tuesday in BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal.Some of these medicines are distributed in smaller vial sizes in Europe, where governments play a more active role than the United States does in drug pricing and distribution.Drug companies are quietly making billions forcing little old ladies to buy enough medicine to treat football players, and regulators have completely missed it, said Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering and a co-author of the study. If were ever going to start saving money in health care, this is an obvious place to cut.The researchers analyzed the waste generated by the top 20 selling cancer medicines and concluded that insurers paid drug makers $1.8 billion annually on discarded quantities and then spent about $1 billion on markups to doctors and hospitals.Some non-cancer drugs also generate considerable waste, including Remicade, an arthritis drug sold by Johnson & Johnson for which an estimated $500 million of the drugs $4.3 billion in annual sales comes from quantities that are thrown away, researchers found. But such non-cancer drugs were not included in the studys estimates of total waste.In one example, the study said that in the United States Takeda Pharmaceuticals sells Velcade, a drug for the treatment of multiple myeloma and lymphoma, only in 3.5-milligram vials that sell for $1,034 and hold enough medicine to treat a person who is 6 feet 6 inches tall and who weighs 250 pounds. If a patient is smaller, then a quantity of the precious powder is thrown away.Lena Haddad, 53, of Germantown, Md., who has been living with multiple myeloma for four years, now gets a weekly dose of 1.8 milligrams of Velcade. On a recent day at Ms. Haddads doctors office in Bethesda, Md., a nurse, Patricia Traylor, took a vial of Velcade from a large drug cabinet. She injected a syringeful of saline into the vial and shook it, pushed a needle into the vial and withdrew about half the contents. Then she threw out the vial with the remaining medicine.You cant use the remainder for the patient the next time she comes in or use it on another patient, so it has to be discarded as waste, Ms. Traylor said.Safety standards permit nurses to use drug leftovers in other patients only if used within six hours and only in specialized pharmacies.Told that she was using only about half of the drug that was purchased, Ms. Haddad said she was shocked.No wonder my premiums keep going up, she said.Medicare and many private insurers charge patients drug co-payments of as much as 20 percent, which can add up to tens of thousands of dollars annually for the latest drugs; much is spent on cancer medicines that patients never receive, according to the study.Dr. Dixie-Lee Esseltine, vice president for oncology clinical research at Takeda, wrote in an email that the pharmaceutical firm worked closely with the F.D.A. to establish the Velcade vial size of 3.5 mg to ensure that one vial of Velcade would provide an adequate amount of the drug for a patient of almost any size.Velcade is sold in Britain in both 1-milligram and 3.5-milligram vials.Takeda is expected to earn $309 million this year on supplies of Velcade that are discarded, an amount that represents 30 percent of the drugs overall sales in the United States, the cancer researchers estimated. If Takeda provided an additional vial size of 0.25 milligram, waste would be slashed by 84 percent, also reducing Velcades sales in the United States by $261 million annually, the researchers calculated.You have these incredibly expensive drugs, and you can only buy them in bulk, said Dr. Leonard Saltz, who leads the pharmacy and therapeutics committee at Memorial Sloan Kettering and was a co-author of the study. Whats really interesting is theyre selling these drugs in smaller vials in Europe, where regulators are clearly paying attention to this issue.Christopher Kelly, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration, said the agency objected to companies proposed vial sizes only if it believed that an excessively large volume of medicine could lead to medication errors or safety issues due to inappropriate multiple dosing.In other words, as long as nurses are not tempted to do anything but discard additional quantities, the drug agency is fine with extra-large, one-size-fits-all packaging. Congress has not given the drug agency the authority to consider cost in its decisions.Companies propose the vial sizes that they would like to market, Mr. Kelly said.Rising drug prices have been a concern for many years, and high initial prices and subsequent increases are an industrywide phenomenon. The last 10 cancer drugs approved before July 2015 have an average annual price of $190,217, and major drug makers routinely increase the prices of big sellers 10 percent or more each year, far above the rate of inflation.The industry explains that high prices are needed to fund research, but companies such as Pfizer and Merck spend just 17 percent of their revenues finding new drugs, according to their financial statements. Far more goes to marketing and profits.For decades, cancer doctors largely ignored the issue of pricing, but as their patients became impoverished, some began to speak up. In 2012, Dr. Bach and Dr. Saltz wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times announcing that their hospital would not purchase a new cancer drug that was twice as expensive as but no more effective than an existing medicine. The maker of the drug slashed its price.Dr. Bach and Dr. Saltz say they have since become concerned that prices of new cancer medicines have almost no connection with their lifesaving potential. Dr. Bach recently unveiled a complex calculator of drug value.But there was nothing complex about measuring the value of a drug that was thrown away, Dr. Saltz said, since the value to the patient was zero.The two doctors have proposed that the government either mandate that drug makers provide medicines in enough vial sizes to minimize waste, or mandate that drug makers refund the government for wasted quantities.Dr. Saltz first noticed the problem of waste when he was considering adding Keytruda, a new drug for metastatic lung cancer and melanoma, to the hospitals list of drugs to be used on patients. Although a 150-pound patient would need 136 milligrams of the drug, Dr. Saltz noticed that Merck, its manufacturer, sold the medicine only in 50-milligram vials  ensuring waste.I thought that was really cynical, Dr. Saltz said in an interview. And then it got worse.In February 2015, Merck introduced 100-milligram vials and stopped selling Keytruda in 50-milligram vials, ensuring far larger amounts of waste. The company still sells 50-milligram vials of the drug in Europe.Pamela L. Eisele, a Merck spokeswoman, said the company hoped to persuade the F.D.A. to approve a fixed dose of 200 milligrams of Keytruda for all patients, higher than the dose presently given to nearly all patients. In studies given to the drug agency, there was no evidence that the higher dose was more effective, Ms. Eisele said, but the fixed dose will eliminate wastage.Since the extra medicine does nothing to help patients, Dr. Bach said that the company was advocating that waste be injected into patients rather than thrown away.Under its present dosing, Merck would earn $2.4 billion over the next five years from discarded quantities of Keytruda, half of which would result from switching to 100-milligram vials, the researchers estimated.Some cancer drugs have little waste.Treanda, which is used to treat leukemia and non-Hodgkins lymphoma and is manufactured by Teva Pharmaceuticals, is packaged in four separate dosages so only 1 percent of the drug is wasted, on average.But 18 of the top 20 cancer medicines are sold in just one or two vial sizes, so on average 10 percent of the volume of cancer drugs purchased by doctors and hospitals is discarded, the researchers say."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   Recent gains against the Islamic State in eastern Syria have helped sever critical supply lines to Iraq and set the stage for what will be the biggest fight yet against the Sunni militancy, the battle to retake Mosul, Pentagon officials said on Monday.Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a Pentagon news conference that American-backed forces had begun laying the groundwork for the fight by moving to isolate Mosul from the Islamic States de facto headquarters in Raqqa, Syria. Kurdish and Arab forces retook the town of Shaddadi in eastern Syria last week, cutting off what Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter called the last major artery between Raqqa and Mosul.But military officials cautioned that the fight for Mosul could last many months, requiring Iraqi forces unproven in urban warfare to advance street by street through the explosives-laden terrain of Iraqs second-largest city, with more than one million people.In addition to the advances in eastern Syria, the Pentagon has begun using cyberattacks on Islamic State communications between Raqqa and Mosul, as well as attacks meant to disrupt the militant groups ability to use social media to recruit fighters, officials said.Retaking Mosul would be a massive hit to the Islamic State, said Patrick Martin, an Iraq expert at the Institute for the Study of War. Such a loss would bolster claims by the American-led coalition that the Sunni militancy is on the run in Iraq. It could also sharply demoralize Islamic State fighters, raising questions about whether the group could still credibly call itself a caliphate.The Pentagon has declined to predict when Iraqi troops will try to enter Mosul, though General Dunford said on Monday that it is not something that will happen in the deep, deep future. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi of Iraq said two weeks ago that Iraqi forces would start a full military operation to retake the city as early as March, and an American military official said over the weekend that the Pentagon believed that Iraqi troops were ready to launch a credible assault.Still, military officials acknowledge that the battle will be an uphill slog. Do I think its going to be easy? No, Maj. Gen. Richard Clarke, the commander of American land forces in Iraq, told reporters during a briefing last week. Its going to be tough.The long fight by Iraqi security forces to take back Ramadi from the Islamic State, which concluded in December, offers a preview of the battle to come over Mosul. Advancing inch by inch, Iraqi forces, backed by American airstrikes, took more than five months to gain control of the city center of Ramadi, the capital of Anbar Province.As difficult as that battle was, the fight for Mosul will be much harder, military officials say. The city is five times as large as Ramadi. And while the Iraqi military used two American-trained brigades in the Ramadi fight  the 73rd and the 76th, which General Clarke said were believed to be the best in the Iraqi Army  those forces number some 8,000, far short of the 30,000 troops Pentagon officials say are needed.Military officials also say it is hard to imagine how the fight for Mosul can be waged without close American air support, which would probably require American attack helicopters, something Mr. Abadi, for political reasons, has yet to agree to.The effort is likely to include Kurdish pesh merga fighters, Pentagon officials say. The American military has trained some 16,000 Kurdish fighters, but their participation is likely to come with its own problems. I do think the expectation is that the force will be heavily Kurdish, but then you get into the political issues, said Kathleen H. Hicks, a former Pentagon official who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Mr. Abadis government is unlikely to want the Kurdish fighters to assume the lead role in the coming fight, a role that Iraq experts say is likely to be filled by the Shiite-dominated Iraqi security forces.In 2004, it took more than 13,000 highly trained troops, primarily Americans, almost two months to retake and clear Falluja of about 3,000 insurgents in the fiercest fight of the Iraq war. Ninety-five American service members died, and more than 560 were wounded.The battle for Mosul, many military experts say, could be much worse. Pentagon officials say they are unsure how many Islamic State militants are in the city, but they have been there for almost two years.When the coalition cleared Falluja, it took forever, and Mosul is larger than Falluja, Mr. Martin, the Iraq expert, said. And the people who will be doing the clearing are not U.S. troops.Staff Gen. Talib al-Kinani, the commander of Iraqs Counter Terrorism Service, said the units that would participate in the Mosul operation had already been chosen. Commanders have moved to a town on the edge of Kurdish-controlled areas to complete the final planning, he said.General Kinani said the Iraqi military was working with Sunni tribes in Mosul against the Islamic State. The tribes, he said, are giving information about those locations that are planted with explosive materials and I.E.D.s, and also they talk about the morale and the status of the ISIS fighters inside the city."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   Half of one satisfying sexual encounter a month. That is the average benefit a woman gets when she takes the new female libido drug, sometimes called the female Viagra, researchers reported Monday.Last year the Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, flibanserin, making it the first drug available to treat low sexual desire in women. It was promoted by a group of womens rights activists who argued it was unfair that men had numerous drugs to boost sexual function while women had nothing.But public health groups and some other womens groups contended that the science did not justify its approval. The drugs effects were modest, they said, and not worth side effects such as sleepiness, dizziness, fatigue and nausea. And the risk of some side effects increased with alcohol consumption.In the new study, published in JAMA Internal Medicine, researchers found benefits that were slightly more modest than those submitted to the F.D.A. during the approval process. The researchers analyzed eight studies of about 5,900 women, using a method that involved pooling the data. They concluded that treatment with flibanserin, now marketed as Addyi, resulted in one-half of an additional sexually satisfying encounter per month. (The study did not define what one-half of a sexually satisfying encounter was.)That result was not very different from original findings of three clinical trials submitted to the F.D.A. as support for the drugs approval. Those trials found that once women started taking the drug, they had an average of about one additional satisfying sexual encounter a month, on top of the two to three they were having already. That result lifted the benefits above the bar of being scientifically meaningful, but barely. Still, it was enough for the agencys approval.In a statement, Dr. Tage Ramakrishna, the chief medical officer at Valeant, the company that now owns the drug, said that the new analysis confirmed the findings of the clinical trials and provided little additional context. He said the way the analysis was done, combining data from a number of different studies, carried less statistical weight than the randomized trials .The drug was approved last June, after twice being rejected by the agency over several years. In the clinical trial results submitted, women taking the drug also reported on monthly questionnaires that they felt more desire, although the difference compared with a placebo was also meager  only about 0.3 points on a scale ranging from 1.2 to 6.0.Experts who had opposed the drugs approval said the JAMA analysis, which confirmed that the drug increased the risk of dizziness, sleepiness, nausea and fatigue, underscored the meagerness of the benefit.An additional half a satisfying sexual encounter a month  is that meaningful? asked Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, the director of PharmedOut, a project at Georgetown University that questions the influence of drug companies on the practice of medicine. I think only the women can answer that, but perhaps they already have with their lack of enthusiasm for getting prescriptions.The drug is not selling well. As of early January, Addyi was generating only 240 to 290 prescriptions a week, according to a report last week by David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo Securities, who cited the prescription tracker IMS Health as the source of the data. Mr. Maris estimated that sales of Addyi were running at a rate of $11 million a year, well below the $100 million to $150 million in sales that Valeant said it hoped to achieve this year.Still, some said the drug helped. Dr. Lauren Streicher, an associate clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said a number of her patients have taken the drug and reported significant increases in libido. None has discontinued use because of side effects, she said.The analysis was undertaken by researchers in Europe, but one of the studys authors, Dr. Ellen Laan, an associate professor in the Department of Sexology and Psychosomatic Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Academic Medical Center at the University of Amsterdam, has been an opponent of the drug. Last year, she helped organize a letter to the F.D.A. opposing the approval and signed another letter to Congress that said the argument about gender equality was misleading and dangerous."}
{"text": "A Maryland university president resigned on Monday, weeks after a furor erupted on campus over faculty firings and a student newspaper article that quoted the president as comparing struggling freshmen to bunnies that should be drowned or shot.The board of the university, Mount St. Marys in Emmitsburg, about 60 miles northwest of Baltimore, announced that the dean of the business school would replace the departing university leader, Simon Newman, as acting president effective immediately.Mr. Newman, a former financial industry executive who was born in the United Kingdom and was in his first year as president, said the controversy over his administration at the nations second-oldest Catholic university had become too great a distraction.I believe it is the right course of action for the Mount at this time, he said in a statement.The decision was an abrupt reversal for Mr. Newman, who had vowed not to step down even after faculty members called for his resignation and his actions were denounced by advocates of academic and journalistic freedom.In January, the article by two student journalists, Rebecca Schisler and Ryan Golden, in The Mountain Echo reported two notable pieces of news. It said that the administration was planning to cull struggling freshmen as part of an effort to improve retention numbers  a major factor in rankings published in publications like U.S. News & World Report  and that Mr. Newman had used startling language to convince a skeptical professor last fall of the idea.This is hard for you because you think of the students as cuddly bunnies, but you cant, Mr. Newman is quoted as saying. You just have to drown the bunnies.He added, Put a Glock to their heads.Mr. Newman later apologized and said his retention proposal had been meant to help students at risk of academic failure and burdensome debt.Weeks later, however, the student papers faculty adviser, Ed Egan, was fired for what the university administration called disloyalty, a move seen by many as a retaliatory strike. Mr. Egan said in an interview that he had no doubt that the article was the cause of his termination: Theres no other possible explanation.The firing, along with other punishments of faculty members  an associate professor of philosophy, Thane Naberhaus, a critic of Mr. Newmans policies, was also dismissed; and David Rehm, a provost who had raised concerns about the retention proposal, was stripped of his role  drew condemnation from academics across the country.Mr. Newman then reversed the firings of Mr. Egan and Dr. Naberhaus at a faculty meeting in February. But the damage had been done. Faculty members voted 87 to 3 to demand that Mr. Newman resign for the good of our community.It has become apparent that negative public attention has interfered with our ability to continue in our work and to bring new students and faculty to this campus, the faculty said in a joint statement released by David McCarthy, the secretary to the faculty. We have come to the sad conclusion that this state of affairs cannot be resolved while you continue in your current office.Mr. Newman appeared to have the backing of the universitys board, however. The Rev. Kevin Farmer, a board member, said the trustees had faith in Mr. Newmans vision for the future of the university and his ability to lead. But the furor refused to die down, and a petition circulated among scholars protesting the firings drew thousands of signatures.On Monday, the board of trustees named Karl Einolf, dean of the Richard J. Bolte Sr. School of Business, as acting president.The board chairman, John E. Coyne, said in the statement, The board is grateful to President Newman for his many accomplishments over the past year, including strengthening the universitys finances, developing a comprehensive strategic plan for our future and bringing many new ideas to campus that have benefited the entire Mount community.The universitys faculty leaders issued a brief statement late Monday. We, the deans and department chairs of Mount St. Marys University, express our thanks to Simon Newman for his work on our behalf and wish him well in his future endeavors, it read in part.On Monday night, a video of Mr. Newmans extolling the achievements at the university was still on its website. Weve also added newly renovated lounges, and welcomed Starbucks to campus, he said. Plus, weve taken action to show how deeply our community cares about the world around us. He said he and the trustees were planning for what were calling Mount 2.0.We will do great things together, he concluded."}
{"text": "POLICE sergeants routinely tell their officers that their most important job is to make it home safely. And it is no wonder why they dispense this advice. With an estimated 350 million firearms in the United States, officers daily face the threat of gun violence, making this country far more dangerous for the police than countries with tight controls on guns.Last Saturdays shooting of Ashley Guindon, a police officer in Prince William County in Virginia, is a reminder of how dangerous policing can be. She was shot dead while responding to a domestic violence call on her first day on patrol.Unfortunately, this sense of ever-present danger has shaped police training, tactics and culture in ways that can lead to responses that are neither proportional nor necessary in situations that dont involve guns. We need to rethink our tactics in such circumstances.Perhaps the best example is the so-called 21-foot rule. In many police departments, officers are trained to be prepared to shoot if they are within 21 feet of someone with a knife. This can lead to whats known among the police as a lawful but awful response.This is because the legal standard used in police shootings allows prosecutors and grand juries to conclude that although an officers shooting of a suspect may be questionable, it isnt criminal.The standard came from a 1989 Supreme Court decision, Graham v. Connor. The justices ruled that an officers use of force must be objectively reasonable. But the court went on to caution that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments  in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving  about the amount of force that is necessary in a particular situation.This standard can lead to results like this: A mentally ill person is on the street throwing rocks and is shot to death minutes or even seconds after the police arrive. The shooting is found to be legally justified (lawful), but to many who witness it or see it later on video, it does not appear to be proportional or necessary (awful). In other words, just because the police can legally use deadly force doesnt always mean they should.Thirty percent of 990 fatal police shootings in 2015 did not involve someone with a gun, according to an examination by The Washington Post. In 9 percent of the shootings, the subject was unarmed, and in 16 percent, armed with a knife. The remaining 5 percent involved people who used a vehicle as a weapon.Some 200 police chiefs and law enforcement officials from across the country met recently to finalize a years worth of work to take our profession to a standard higher than what Graham v. Connor requires. The goal is to prevent lawful-but-awful outcomes while increasing officer safety.We looked at how officers are trained for situations in which a person is armed with an edged weapon like a knife. Although these confrontations can be extremely dangerous, the police should not automatically handle these people as they would a gunman. Often there are ways to defuse these confrontations without resorting to deadly force.Our recommendations are based in part on what we learned last November, when officials from 23 American police agencies traveled to Scotland to see how the police there resolve such situations. Most police officers in Scotland dont carry firearms, so they have become expert in combining crisis intervention skills (such as learning how to communicate more effectively with a mentally ill person) with tactics and equipment like sprays and shields for disarming people with knives.The key for the police in such circumstances is to slow things down: to ask questions rather than bark orders, to speak in a normal tone, to summon additional resources if necessary. Pulling out a gun on an anxious person may unintentionally raise his level of stress. In suicide by cop confrontations, this can make a bad situation worse.We found that this approach works  not only in Britain, where police officials say it has increased the safety of officers and the public, but also in places like New York City and in Camden, N.J.In November, Camden County police officers responded to a man on the street with a knife. Rather than rushing toward him and putting themselves in a position where they had to use deadly force, the officers followed the suspect down the street, kept at a distance and arrested him when he dropped the knife. No shots were fired and no one was injured.Slowing it down is not always possible. Police officers are sometimes attacked suddenly, as in the October 2014 assault on a group of New York police officers by a man with a hatchet. This attack lasted less than 10 seconds. The assailant was shot and killed. But in many encounters, officers can keep a safe distance and evaluate the situation.Toward that end, the countrys 18,000 police departments need to rethink their strategies for responding to situations that do not involve guns. In short, the use of force must be proportional to the threat. Officers should focus on calming volatile situations. They must intervene if they see colleagues using excessive force. First aid must be rendered promptly. Shooting at vehicles should be prohibited.If officers are properly trained and equipped, they and the people they encounter can walk away unharmed from many situations that now end in police shootings. In the end, police policies and training must be centered on the sanctity of all human life."}

Were pruning in early February in the residential streets around Jewel Avenue, because a water main will be renovated here and the heavy equipment will wreak havoc on overhanging branches.Bob the pruner and I proceed block by block, inspecting the trees that need a haircut. He steps back on the ground first and takes in the whole shape of the tree, then hops in the bucket, zooms into the face of the canopy, grabs one or two of the branches to get them out of his face  and, it seems, just to get the feel of them. Then he revs up his chain saw and goes to work.Despite the concrete and the asphalt and all the brick houses lining the street, I have the sense that were making our way through a deep forest. The diversity of species is astonishing. The common ginkgo is uncommon here. There are massive pin oaks and diminutive, delicate plums, many red maples, heavy sycamores still holding aloft their pompom seed pods. Here there are cherries, sweetgums, London planes, lindens, zelkovas, crab apples. A few bald cypresses and eastern redbuds. A swamp white oak. In New York City? Its a veritable garden of specimens, an arboretum to rival the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx.When Bob comes back to earth he is smiling, all thumbs up. It must look different from the height of a bucket. Im going to go up there some day."}
{"text": "FAIRFAX, Va.   On the eve of Super Tuesday, as Hillary Clinton urged her supporters to turn out to vote, people on the sidelines of her campaign rally here seemed less revved up than resigned.The time had come, several said, to end their romance with Bernie Sanders and settle down with Mrs. Clinton.Bernie Sanderss odds of getting the nomination are maybe not that great, said Mitchell Westall, 19, of Suffolk, Va., who added that he had been intrigued by the Vermont senators vision. So Im looking at the other Democrat.Mrs. Clinton, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state, is not used to being the other Democrat. But as voters cast ballots Tuesday in 11 states that could give her a prohibitive lead in the race for the partys presidential nomination, she seemed to be enjoying something of a homecoming: After eyeing, enjoying and encouraging Mr. Sanderss insurgency for months, Democrats seemed ready to restore to Mrs. Clinton and her candidacy the air of inevitability with which she began her campaign in April.Across the country, from the crucial swing state of Virginia to deeper-blue Minnesota, from the Sanders strongholds in New England to the Clinton redoubts of the South, many Democratic voters said that despite being aware, and sometimes wary, of Mrs. Clintons trust issues, they were more than ready to support her. Often, they said they were swayed as much by the arguments of Mrs. Clintons most persuasive surrogates  delegate math, and Fear of a Trump Presidency  as by the candidate herself.Seeing Donald J. Trump as an existential threat to American values, many Democrats said in interviews that they were ready to eschew the dreamy Sanders revolution for the heavy artillery of Mrs. Clinton and her battle-tested campaign machine.If this country gets a Republican, we are in big trouble, especially with Trump, Flor Giraldo, 59, an unemployed emergency room technician, said Tuesday outside of a polling place in Chelsea, Mass. If he gets chosen, this will be an impossible country, and I think Hillary is going to save us.In the Boston neighborhood of West Roxbury, where Mayor Martin J. Walsh and former President Bill Clinton campaigned for Mrs. Clinton on Tuesday morning, her supporters acknowledged grappling with whether they could trust Mrs. Clinton and worrying that something explosive, and destructive to her candidacy, could still come to light.I hope theres nothing in those speeches that she made, said Adrienne Vaughan, an immigration lawyer, referring to Mrs. Clintons speeches to Goldman Sachs and other financial firms, for which she was paid handsomely but has not released transcripts.Similar concerns echoed in Decatur, Ga., where Dana Calleja, 47, said she had voted for Mrs. Clinton while admitting that she had reservations. I wish there werent all of the questions around the emails and Benghazi, Ms. Calleja said, but it all came down to qualifications.In dozens of interviews, voters said their desire for an experienced candidate who would be favored to win in November had played a greater role in their decisions than enthusiasm for Mrs. Clinton.I dont vote with my emotions, said Bridget Coughlan Hermer, 54, a teacher and Clinton supporter from Madison Lake, Minn. I vote with my head.Through such a pragmatic frame, Ms. Hermer saw a silver lining to Mrs. Clintons ties to Wall Street, which Mr. Sanders has assailed as emblematic of a rigged campaign finance system: She knows how to earn money and keep her campaign running, Ms. Hermer said.One thing nearly all of Mrs. Clintons supporters agree on is that her rsum is without compare in the primary contest.In Austin, Tex., Donald Goertz, 76, a former classics teacher, said he had voted for Mrs. Clinton because I cant imagine anybody more knowledgeable than Hillary. But he said he had to fight the tug of Mr. Sanderss message: I like his populism.And when his wife, Donna Bryant Goertz, 76, a founder of Austins oldest Montessori school, professed her affection for Mrs. Clinton, it was in the form of tough love: I love Hillary, she said. I think what she needs is a strong dose of Bernie. I voted for Bernie  to push her more in the direction that we would both like her to go.The adoration for Mrs. Clinton was less conditional in Atlantas West End, where African-American voters trickling into a polling place at West Hunter Street Baptist Church had warm things to say about her, but warmer things to say about her husband.Im comfortable because her husband was president, said Walter Clark, 53, who drives trains for the local commuter-rail system. She knows the ins and outs.Denise Blake, 49, the executive director of a nonprofit, said that despite being tempted by Mr. Sanderss demand for a radical fix to income inequality, Mr. Trumps terrifying ascent had pushed her into Mrs. Clintons column.Not all of Mrs. Clintons supporters, of course, needed an extra nudge.Many women interviewed took visible pride in the prospect of voting for a woman for president for the first time. And in an election that has been dominated in its early stages by energy for outsider candidates, voters also expressed appreciation for Mrs. Clintons long career, and her ability to work within a political framework that they did not consider all that broken.Clinton. Women power! blurted out Chetna Maheshwari, 44, a teacher who emigrated from India, as she walked Monday evening with her daughter at the Rust Library in suburban Leesburg, Va.Ms. Maheshwari said she voted for Mrs. Clinton in Virginias presidential primary in 2008, and seemed uninterested in Mr. Sanderss call for revolution. We have a system in place, and its working, she said. Why keep changing it again and again?She said she hoped Mrs. Clinton would build on President Obamas record and protect abortion rights. Not unlike Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Maheshwari said she was already looking past Mr. Sanders and toward the Democrats ability to preserve the countrys inclusive character.But the election may hinge less on genuine passion for Mrs. Clinton than on alarm about the advancing opponent Democrats see in the fall.Stopping Donald Trump is something thats definitely on my mind, as he is getting a lot of support, Mr. Westall said at the Fairfax rally. If it comes down to him and Hillary, there is almost no choice but to vote for Hillary there."}

{"text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia  Ted Cruz says climate change is not happening. Donald Trump says he doesnt believe in it. Marco Rubio, whose hometown, Miami, is projected to be largely underwater within the not too distant future as ice caps shrink and the sea level rises, argues that government efforts to combat it will destroy our economy.But those views are not widely shared by conservatives elsewhere around the world. Indeed, not that long ago in a not too distant country, a right-leaning party that shares many of the antitax, pro-business beliefs of Republicans in the United States did exactly what its unbelieving candidates so fear.In 2008, the British Columbia Liberal Party, which confoundingly leans right, introduced a tax on the carbon emissions of businesses and families, cars and trucks, factories and homes across the province. The party stuck to the tax even as the left-leaning New Democratic Party challenged it in provincial elections the next year under the slogan Axe the Tax. The conservatives won soundly at the polls.Their experience shows that cutting carbon emissions enough to make a difference in preventing global warming remains a difficult challenge. But the most important takeaway for American skeptics is that the policy basically worked as advertised.British Columbias economy did not collapse. In fact, the provincial economy grew faster than its neighbors even as its greenhouse gas emissions declined.It performed better on all fronts than I think any of us expected, said Mary Polak, the provinces environment minister. To the extent that the people who modeled it predicted this, Im not sure that those of us on the policy end of it really believed it.The tax, which rose from 10 Canadian dollars per ton of carbon dioxide in 2008 to 30 dollars by 2012, the equivalent of about $22.20 in current United States dollars, reduced emissions by 5 to 15 percent with negligible effects on aggregate economic performance, according to a study last year by economists at Duke University and the University of Ottawa.The tax made fuel more expensive: A gallon of gas, for example, costs 19 United States cents more. It encouraged people to drive somewhat less and be more careful about heating and cooling their homes. Businesses invested in energy efficiency measures and switched to less polluting fuels.Despite the price increases, voters warmed to the tax. Last year only 32 percent of British Columbians opposed the tax, down from 47 percent in 2009.Perhaps most surprisingly, so did big business. And for good reason. As it turns out, a carbon tax is the most efficient, market-friendly instrument available in the quiver against climate change.We were not very happy when it was first announced, said Jock A. Finlayson, head of policy at the Business Council of British Columbia. Now, within the business community there is a sizable constituency saying this is O.K.Christopher Knittel, an expert on energy economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said a properly calibrated carbon price in the United States could effectively replace all the climate-related regulations businesses hate so much, including renewable fuel mandates and President Obamas Clean Power Plan.That would create a clear incentive for businesses and consumers to use less fuel, invest in efficiency and switch to cleaner energy. The only other necessary action, in Professor Knittels view, would be more government support for research and development to accelerate the quest for new energy technologies.Here in British Columbia, however, it wasnt the efficiency argument alone that won people over. The pioneering legislation provided critical political cover by ensuring every single carbon tax dollar would be returned to families and businesses through a variety of breaks.That is the thing that saved us, said Carole Taylor, the provincial minister of finance at the time the tax was introduced. If I had said, Give us the carbon tax and trust us, I knew it would have been a failure.The corporate income tax was cut to 10 percent from 12 percent, to stimulate a flagging economy in 2010. Though it is back to 11 percent, it is still the lowest among Canadas provinces. The bottom two personal income tax rates were also cut. Low-income families got a tax credit.All in all, the government will return about 1.7 billion Canadian dollars to businesses and families this year, more than the 1.2 billion dollars it expects to collect though the carbon tax, which amounts to roughly 5 percent of the provinces total tax revenue.According to the World Bank, about 12 percent of the worlds global emissions of greenhouse gases are subject to a carbon price  either a tax or, more commonly, a levy under a regime of cap and trade like that in California and Europe, in which permits to emit are auctioned among companies.With few exceptions, British Columbias tax is the steepest and broadest in existence. While that sets British Columbia apart as a leader on the cutting edge, it is also part of its problem. For the policy to work best, it needs the rest of the world to catch up.Local leaders now recognize that they probably have to do more. Carbon emissions started rising again after the province froze the tax at 30 Canadian dollars in 2012. An advisory panel to the Ministry of the Environment recently laid out the problem: British Columbia is missing its goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by a third from 2007 to 2020. On its current path, the province will also miss its target of an 80 percent reduction by 2050.This is not entirely British Columbias fault. True, the tax might have been too low. Spending some of the money on green initiatives might have curbed emissions faster. But its experiment has battled a harsh headwind: a collapse in the prices of oil and gasoline.Look at it this way. A study by Michael Greenstone and Thomas Covert of the University of Chicago and Professor Knittel  concluded that at current battery prices, for an electric vehicle to be cheaper to run than a gas-power car, oil would have to cost $350 a barrel. Last year, it averaged $50. To make up the difference would require a carbon tax of $700 a ton of carbon dioxide.Nobody in British Columbia is talking about going that far. But to hit its long-term target, the advisory panel concluded that the tax must start increasing again in 2018, at a rate of 10 Canadian dollars a ton a year, perhaps all the way to midcentury.And thats where the support from business starts to break down. If British Columbia were to proceed on its own without providing some form of protection to its energy intensive industries, Mr. Finlayson argued, they would simply lose markets to producers outside its borders that pay no carbon tax.Cement makers, for instance, argue that imports from China and the United States grew from 5 to 40 percent of the market as the carbon price was introduced and raised gradually to 30 Canadian dollars. Teck, the Canadian mining company, says that alone among its competitors it pays 50 million Canadian dollars in carbon taxes. Rather than seeing the tax burden rise further, said Marcia Smith, senior vice president for sustainability, Teck wants the gap narrowed.The advisory panel recommends unspecified adjustments to protect such trade-exposed industries. Still, the Business Council of British Columbia opposed an increase.Keep the B.C. carbon tax in place at the current level over the balance of the decade, it recommended. Post-2020, policy makers should review the tax in light of actions by other jurisdictions to narrow the existing gaps with B.C. in carbon pricing.British Columbia could do with some help from its neighbors. Four other provinces have carbon prices either pending or in place, though they are generally much lower. If more embraced a carbon tax, they would mitigate many of the concerns over competitiveness.The new Canadian government, headed by Justin Trudeau, seems ready to come on board, imposing some pan-Canadian minimum price. If the United States embraced a carbon tax as part of a comprehensive overhaul of its tax system, the path would be much easier.That, however, would require Republicans in Washington to recognize that the threat of climate change is not simply a left-wing fantasy. If they do, British Columbia underscores there is a market friendly way to do something about it."}
{"text": "Over four decades, at least 50 priests and other church employees molested hundreds of children in a small Roman Catholic diocese in central Pennsylvania, and in many cases their superiors knew of the abuses but did not remove the priests or notify law enforcement, according to a grand jury report released on Tuesday.But none of the findings will result in prosecution, according to State Attorney General Kathleen G. Kane, whose office led the investigation, because the statutes of limitations on all alleged crimes have expired.The report names a dozen priests who admitted  to church officials, to the grand jury or both  that they had molested children, and other cases where church records made clear that their superiors believed they were guilty. None were taken to law enforcement, and in cases where police or prosecutors learned of allegations, the report says, church officials worked to hush them up.They placed their desire to avoid public scandal over the well-being of innocent children, the report says.The Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown is only the most recent to be the target of an investigation and a report by a grand jury or attorney general for shielding priests who abused children. But the numbers it cites are striking for a diocese that claims fewer than 100,000 Catholics.There have been public allegations in the past against some of the priests named in the report, including the Rev. Joseph D. Maurizio Jr., who is to be sentenced on Wednesday in a case that drew international attention. Father Maurizio, who raised money for an orphanage in Honduras, was convicted in federal court in September of sexually abusing boys at the orphanage, money laundering and possessing child pornography.Bishop Joseph Adamec, former leader of the diocese, learned of allegations against Father Maurizio in 2009, according to the grand jury report and the charity that sponsored the orphanage. But Bishop Adamec and his successor, Bishop Mark L. Bartchak, kept Father Maurizio on as pastor at a church in Central City, Pa., until shortly before his arrest in 2014.Given that record, Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, said she was puzzled that the grand jury report did not hold Bishop Bartchak accountable, as well.In a statement, the diocese said it had cooperated fully with authorities throughout the investigation, and will continue to do so.The report offers a scathing picture of Bishop James Hogan, who led the diocese from 1966 to 1986, and died in 2005, as a leader who repeatedly persuaded the police and prosecutors to drop criminal cases against priests, failed to discipline people he knew were abusers, and responded to complaints about predatory priests by relocating them to jobs where they could molest again.It contains serious, but less harsh, criticism of his successor, Bishop Adamec, who retired in 2011 but retains his title. It cites a few priests who were allowed to continue ministry for years after the diocese learned of allegations against them, including three who remain active priests, and notes that the diocese turned none of the priests in to the police or prosecutors.The records indicate that with over half the priests, the diocese did not learn of alleged abuse until decades had passed, when no legal action was possible.The bishops lawyer, David Berardinelli, released a response describing the grand jury report as one-sided and unfair. It notes that unlike his predecessors, Bishop Adamec frequently suspended accused pedophile priests, often soon after learning of the allegations, and asked the church hierarchy to defrock them. Those he allowed to remain in active ministry have had no new allegation of abuse of a minor since then.Pope Francis called last year for the Vatican to create a tribunal on judging bishops accused of negligence, but the Vatican has yet to do so. Last month, Francis said in a news conference that bishops who kept abusive priests in ministry should resign.The report names 35 priests, most of them now dead, who have been accused of child molestation, and cites other abusers who are not named. The information is based mostly on documents taken from diocesan offices in 2014 under a search warrant."}
{"text": "KABUL, Afghanistan   Women and girls in Afghan jails are frequently subjected to forced virginity tests, advocates from Afghanistans human rights commission said on Tuesday, calling for an end to a discredited practice that is both invasive and degrading.A report by Afghanistans Independent Human Rights Commission, based on interviews with 53 female detainees across 12 of the countrys 34 provinces, found that 48 of them, including girls as young as 13, had been sent for virginity tests. The procedure, which has widely been found to be scientifically invalid, is frequently conducted in the presence of many people and in an invasive manner that could amount to rape or torture, the report said.President Ashraf Ghani, who has not been briefed on the findings, was deeply saddened by reports of the practice, and had asked the human rights commission for a full review, said Sayed Zafar Hashemi, a spokesman for Mr. Ghani.The president expects the reformist chief justice to abolish the practice, Mr. Hashemi said.Around 750 women and girls are being held in jails and prisons across 29 provinces, according to Afghanistans Interior Ministry. Most of the women were detained on vague charges of moral crimes for running away from home  either with a lover other than the husband arranged for them by their families, or to escape domestic violence.Although efforts to improve rights and conditions for Afghan women have been a focus since the fall of the Taliban government 14 years ago, many of the tangible gains are seen as fragile and reversible. And the countrys judicial system is one area where rights reforms have met particular resistance.There is a loophole in the law, and it has given an open hand to the judges and legal system, said Dr. Soraya Sobhrang, a human rights commissioner and one of the authors of the report. The womens shelters are sending women for the tests, the Ministry of Womens Affairs is sending them and the police are sending them. The practice in itself is abuse and against Islamic rituals.Virginity tests, examinations of whether the hymen is intact, are intended to establish evidence for cases of adultery. But Dr. Sobhrang, a gynecologist, said the tests had often been scientifically questioned because the status of the hymen is not just determined by sexual intercourse.Heather Barr, a senior researcher for the group Human Rights Watch, said banning such tests would be an important step. Purported virginity exams are so unreliable that the World Health Organization has said that they have no scientific validity and health workers should never conduct them, she said.Ms. Barr added that the tests continued use is part of a broader pattern of abuses in which women and girls in Afghanistan are jailed on spurious moral crimes accusations, often in situations where they are fleeing forced marriage or domestic violence.The government should end these arrests entirely and reform the law that permits them, she said.Many of the women interviewed for the report said they had to go through the test in the presence of multiple people, including male police officers on some occasions. One woman in northeastern Badakhshan Province said she had been subjected to the test four times, once in the presence of six medical workers.Sometimes the doctor just writes, The hymen is not broken, but it is possible that it was anal penetration, Dr. Sobhrang said. That one question mark sends people to jail and keeps bringing them back for more tests. The victim gets victimized again and again."}
{"text": "When the world was given a pre-opening peek in 1966 at the building designed by Marcel Breuer on East 75th Street and Madison Avenue, the new home of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the ceremony was nearly canceled because of a bomb threat, one that would have sent luminaries like Jacqueline Kennedy and Mayor John V. Lindsay into the streets.On Tuesday, the Metropolitan Museum of Art formally reintroduced the building as the Met Breuer, its new Brutalist outpost for Modern and contemporary art, and the gathering was an altogether quieter affair. The only bombshells were on the walls: Leonardos, Titians, Rembrandts and Turners that at first glance looked so strange amid the Breuers trapezoidal windows and glowering-grid ceiling coffers that they seemed to be parts of a conceptual work devised by a wry contemporary artist  maybe Jeff Koons, who collects old masters and was the subject of the Whitneys send-off to the space in October 2014.But Met curators and officials, who migrated from Fifth Avenue in droves on Tuesday for a crowded news media preview of the building, described this sense of dislocation as gratifying for an encyclopedic museum, especially one that has long struggled to bring the masterpieces of the last century into conversation with those from the five or so millenniums preceding.Thomas P. Campbell, the Mets director, called the move  first proposed more than eight years ago by Leonard A. Lauder, then the Whitneys chairman, as a way of keeping the lights burning  not only a turning point for the Met but a significant moment for the city.This is a masterpiece of midcentury architecture, and were going to be reactivating it with a new curatorial spirit and reweaving it in new ways into the cultural fabric of New York City, he said, standing on the museums garden level, at the base of what the critic Ada Louise Huxtable once described as the buildings disconcertingly top-heavy, inverted pyramidal mass, a shape that grew on one only slowly, she added, like a taste for olives or warm beer.But the building  which the Met has leased from the Whitney for eight years and which opens to the public on March 18  has long since taken its place within the citys architectural DNA. And in deciding how to reinvent it for a new museum and a new age, John H. Beyer, a founding partner of Beyer Blinder Belle, the architecture firm that restored the building, said that most of the decisions involved simple, originalist steps backward, to Breuers intentions. The bookstore was removed from the northern end of the lobby to open up the floor so visitors immediately sense the broad span between the museums load-bearing walls. A partial wall concealing the guts of the old automated coat rack was also removed, Mr. Beyer said, because that coat rack was as much a part of Breuers design as the architecture  he loved it; it was new technology.The buildings few basic materials  concrete, granite, bluestone pavers, bronze for handles and railings and elevator doors  were taken almost back to their elemental states, with only a low-sheen wax applied to the floors. The wood railings were stripped of varnish and finished with Danish oil, as Breuer specified, so that they exude a sense of texture that the architect described as being close to earth. The rough, bush-hammered concrete walls, which reveal the black obsidian stones used in their making, were only cleaned and holes in them were plugged, sometimes with obsidian, to mimic the texture around them.He loved the hard dignity of aging materials, Mr. Beyer said. One of the most important parts of restoration is in deciding what not to do. And we didnt do a lot. But what we did, I think, gives you a clear understanding of the space as he created it.In preparing the exhibition that fills the museums third and fourth floors, Unfinished: Thoughts Left Visible, which examines, over more than six centuries, the idea of what constitutes a completed work of art, curators from Met departments who rarely see one another except in the cafeteria worked together for months to fill Breuers art-friendly spaces with works made by both the living and the very-long dead.One of the things thats been so thrilling for us, said Andrea Bayer, a curator of European paintings, is to see how different our own paintings look here, and the effect is hard to understate. Many, particularly from the Renaissance, stand up to Breuers unforgiving materials and grids in a very muscular way, she said  and one that underscores how much of the contemporary sculpture in the show draws a straight line all the way back to Michelangelo.The painter Kerry James Marshall, one of the few living artists among the opening crowd on Tuesday, said that no matter how much his contemporaries might want to deny or push against it, on some level, in one way or another, all of us want to be a part of an institution like the Met.Artists make art because other artists made work that inspires them, said Mr. Marshall, who has a painting in the Unfinished show and whose retrospective will come to the Breuer this fall. But at a certain point, just coming to the museum to see what other people did in those spaces is unacceptable.For himself, he summed up, exultantly: I can finally say that Ive been in an exhibition with Leonardo da Vinci."}
{"text": "Senator Lindsey Graham, watching Donald J. Trumps rise in Tuesdays voting contests, now sees a colleague he reviles, Senator Ted Cruz, as the lesser of two evils to save the Republican Party.Ted Cruz is not my favorite by any means, Mr. Graham told CBS News late Tuesday, as Mr. Trump was on course to win seven states. But he added, We may be in a position where we have to rally around Ted Cruz as the only way to stop Donald Trump.For Mr. Graham, the South Carolina Republican who dropped out of the presidential race in December, the comment is a sea change. Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator, is far from beloved among most of his colleagues. Many of them still resent that he called the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a liar in a speech on the Senate floor.Mr. Graham has said, at least half jokingly, that if someone killed Mr. Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you. That sentiment has been part of why a number of Republicans have moved toward another senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, as their best option for defeating Mr. Trump.But late Tuesday, Mr. Graham suggested that the situation has become so dire that, at this point, the party should get behind Mr. Cruz.I cant believe I would say yes. But yes, he told the interviewer Charlie Rose."}

And bank shares, the worst-performing sector of the market so far this year, led the way higher.Stocks jumped at 10 a.m., when the Commerce Department reported that construction spending continued to rise in January. At the same time, a survey showed some signs of life in the beaten-down manufacturing sector.Along with banks, big names in consumer and technology stocks also climbed, as did oil prices.The Standard & Poors 500-stock index surged 46.12 points, or 2.4 percent, to 1,978.35. That was the biggest gain for the S.&P. 500 since late January.The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with technology companies, made its biggest gain since August, adding 131.65 points, or 2.9 percent, to 4,689.60.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 348.58 points, or 2.1 percent, to 16,865.08.In recent months, the strong dollar has hurt tech stocks, which do a lot of business outside the United States, because it makes their products more expensive overseas and cuts into their revenue. Those stocks climbed Tuesday, with the biggest gains going to familiar names.Apple gained $3.84, or 4 percent, to $100.53. It had been more than a month since Apple stock closed above $100.

{"text": "The strength of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the Super Tuesday primary contests, evident before the first votes were cast, brings the 2016 presidential race to a point of reckoning. Not enough delegates were at stake to give either candidate a mathematical lock on a nomination, but voters can see the shape of the choice facing them in the general election.The Republicans seem to be reeling, unable or unwilling to comprehend that a shady, bombastic liar is hardening the image of their party as a symbol of intolerance and division.Last summer, as Mr. Trump began to rise in the polls, party leaders took umbrage at the idea that theyd have to do something to keep the nomination from the likes of him. They stood aside and said, let voters decide. Now voters are deciding. They are leaning, in unbelievable numbers, toward a man whose quest for the presidency revolves around targeting religious and racial minorities and people with disabilities, who flirts with white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan, who ridicules and slanders those who disagree with him.His opponents, meanwhile, have rushed to adopt his anger-filled message. Its small wonder that Republican leaders dont seem to know quite what to say.If a person wants to be the nominee of the Republican Party, there can be no evasion and no games, House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday, after months of such games. He sounded navely unaware of the darker elements within the Republican Party, present for decades, and now holding sway: This party does not prey on peoples prejudices. We appeal to their highest ideals. This is the party of Lincoln.The Republican Party is taking a big step toward becoming the party of Trump. Those who could challenge Mr. Trump  Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio  are not only to the right of Mr. Trump on many issues, but are embracing the same game of exclusion, bigotry and character assassination. That Mr. Rubio would make double entendres about the size of Mr. Trumps hands and talk about Mr. Trump wetting his pants shows how much his influence has permeated this race and how willingly his rivals are copying his tactics.There were opportunities to stop this, early on. Possessed of a crack team of researchers, the Republican Party did not turn its resources on investigating this mans record of falsehoods and business failures. When struggling families worry that their childrens American dream will be obscured behind a mountain of college debt, even a passing reference to the scam that is Trump University would surely have resonated many months ago. It may now be too late to alter the course Mr. Trump has set, but Republican leaders would be derelict not to try.On the Democratic side, Mrs. Clinton, who is pulling away in the contest with Bernie Sanders, should stick to the high ground. Say what one will about Mr. Sanderss bid, he has run a campaign admirable in its restraint and positive ideals, no easy feat this year. Mrs. Clinton should continue to campaign on who she is and what she can do for middle-class Americans seeking leadership that reflects the best, not the worst, of political impulses.Mr. Trumps foul statements and shallow ideas can and should be exposed through detailed, dispassionate analysis and smart debate, approaches that would lift his opponent as they diminish him. Republicans are reaping the whirlwind right now, and Democrats should seize the chance to show Americans an alternative to Mr. Trumps politics of rage, and an image of themselves to be proud of, not shrink from."}

{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  In 1970, a Stanford artificial intelligence researcher named John McCarthy returned from a conference in Bordeaux, France, where he had presented a paper on the possibility of a Home Information Terminal.He predicted the terminal would be connected via the telephone network to a shared computer, which in turn would store files that would contain all books, magazines, newspapers, catalogs, airline schedules, public information and personal files.Whitfield Diffie, then a young programmer at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, read Mr. McCarthys paper and began to think about the question of what would take the place of an individual signature in a paperless world. Mr. Diffie would spend the next several years pursuing that challenge and in 1976, with Martin E. Hellman, an electrical engineer at Stanford, invented public-key cryptography, a technique that would two decades later make possible the commercial World Wide Web.On Tuesday, the Association for Computing Machinery announced that the two men have won this years Turing Award. The award is frequently described as the Nobel Prize for the computing world and since 2014, it has included a $1 million cash award, after Google quadrupled its size.This year, it was announced during the RSA Conference, a security technology symposium held here this week.Named for Alan Turing, the British mathematician and computer scientist, the award is particularly noteworthy because it comes at a time that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is locked in a bitter feud with Apple over the agencys inability to unlock the cryptographic system that protects digital information stored in the companys iPhones.While private information can be protected with a so-called symmetric key, or a single digital code, that is used to mathematically scramble the data, the problem becomes much more difficult when two parties who have not met physically wish to have a secret interaction.The privacy protection technology that is now used extensively to protect modern electronic communications is based on Mr. Diffies and Mr. Hellmans original research that led to the creation of public-key cryptography technology.Public-key cryptography is a method for scrambling data in which each party has a pair of keys, one which can be publicly shared and the other which is known only to the intended recipient of a message. It is possible for anyone to encrypt a message using the individuals public key. However, the message can only be unscrambled with the aid of the private key held securely by the recipient of the message.In the United States and elsewhere, cryptography was once a highly classified military and intelligence agency technology. But in the 1970s academic researchers began delving into the field, which led to clashes with law enforcement and spy agencies.In 2013, documents released by Edward J. Snowden, the former government contractor, revealed widespread government surveillance of Internet traffic, leading companies like Apple and Google to modify the security in their products and to the current fight between Apple and the F.B.I.Mr. Diffie and Mr. Hellman have long been political activists. Mr. Hellman has focused on the threat that nuclear weapons pose to humanity, and he said in an interview he would use his share of the prize money to pursue work related to the nuclear threat. He said he also planned to write a new book with his wife on peace and sustainability.Mr. Diffie, who has spent his career working on computer security at telecommunications firms and at the Silicon Valley pioneer Sun Microsystems, has been an outspoken advocate for the protection of personal privacy in the digital age.He said in an interview that he plans to do more to document the history of the field he helped to create. This will free me to spend more of my time on cryptographic history, which is urgent because the people are quickly dying off, Mr. Diffie said."}
{"text": "ATHENS   Terminal E2 in Piraeus, the port city near Athens, is typically a cheerful holding spot for tourists waiting to board ferries for sunny Greek island vacations. But on a recent day, nearly 1,000 exhausted migrants who had just crossed the Aegean Sea from Turkey sprawled across the sweat-soaked floor and on the asphalt outside, waiting to hear if they could continue toward Germany.The answer came soon enough: Syrians and Iraqis could board buses for Greeces northern frontier with Macedonia, which was already choked with nearly 10,000 migrants after Macedonia sealed its border over the weekend. Everyone else  including Afghans, who made up the bulk of the crowd  would be shuttled to one of a rapidly growing number of refugee camps being set up around Athens.With thousands of migrants still arriving each day, and thousands more being turned away from Greeces northern border, the rough outskirts of Athens, Piraeus and the northern city of Thessaloniki near the frontier are becoming the new hot spots to hold them. Camps have been opening at the rate of nearly one a day, including at Greeces dilapidated former Olympic Stadium and in mothballed military bases, to house more than 25,000 people who cannot move forward because of the new border restrictions and because they cannot or will not turn back.The government is planning to open additional camps between Athens and northern Greece to accommodate an expected surge. Following scenes of chaos at the Macedonian border, where migrants on Monday broke down part of a razor-wire fence, the migration minister, Ioannis Mouzalas, warned Wednesday that more than 100,000 migrants would soon be stuck in Greece. The crisis could endure for up to three years, he added, as Greece becomes a reception country  rather than a transit country  for asylum seekers.Weve never seen it like this here, said Katerina Kitidi, a spokeswoman for the United Nations refugee agency, surveying the scene at the ferry terminal as women in head scarves huddled with children on a trash-strewn sidewalk near the sea while men stood in a snaking line for water and food. With the borders shut, there is a big buildup of people and a definite danger of a bad humanitarian situation taking hold in Greece.Afghans, who make up about a third of migrants entering Greece as a back door to Europe, are becoming the largest group to be stuck in limbo here after Macedonia and countries to its north last week abruptly reclassified them as economic migrants rather than refugees. Thousands are waiting around in camps or venturing into central Athens, clutching registration papers, fielding pitches from smugglers for alternate routes to Germany and Austria and trying to figure any way to avoid returning to Afghanistan.Even with the border closed, Afghan people will still come: They would rather brave problems here than face danger and conflict, said Jamshid Azizi, 24, an Afghan who was stuck at Schisto, a camp the government scrambled to open last week near Piraeus, after the Macedonian police returned him to Greece following two attempts to make his way north. We are going to wait here to see if the border opens, and if not, we will do what we can to avoid going back.Even while Europe remains politically paralyzed over how to handle the migrants, it seems to be confronting the reality that refugee camps could be present on the Continent for years to come. On Wednesday, the European Union acknowledged for the first time that a humanitarian crisis was brewing inside its borders, agreeing on an emergency aid package of 700 million euros, or $760 million, over three years to help Greece and other countries on the migrant trail deal with the backlog.At least initially, a majority of the funding is expected to go to help the situation in Greece, and the move highlights the uncertain future for that country, where a debt crisis that began six years ago threatened to sink the euro, the European Unions flagship economic project.But the money did not address the most pressing issue: getting migrants to stop thinking about Europe as their haven from war and economic uncertainty.Even if Europe reaches an agreement at a special summit meeting on March 7 in Brussels to stem the tide of people crossing from Turkey, humanitarian aid groups warn that desperate people fleeing Syria and Iraq will still try to come in anyway, while Afghans and others who do not currently qualify for political asylum could remain in Greece for a considerable period.On Tuesday, the top NATO commander in Europe, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove of the United States Air Force, warned lawmakers in Washington that Russia and the Assad government in Syria were deliberately weaponizing migration in an attempt to overwhelm European structures and break European resolve.At the Schisto camp, a former military barracks that the army converted into a refugee center in just 11 days, preparations were already underway to transform it into a semi-permanent holding facility. On a recent day, more than 1,400 migrants, all but three of them Afghans, milled outside under military surveillance, surrounded by a high fence topped with barbed wire. Around 150 white tents held eight people apiece, while larger tents held scores of additional beds.By the end of March, however, the camp is to be expanded with container shelters to accommodate at least 4,000 people for as long as they need to stay, said Vassilis Thanos, an army spokesman.Already, a construction crew was clearing space for a playground near a makeshift clinic, a food hall and a worship area. The accommodations would keep women and children  who now make up around 60 percent of incoming migrants  separate from the men in order to respect their culture, Mr. Thanos said.If the military base was run in an orderly way, other camps were not.Half an hour away, among the hulking, graffiti-riddled skeletons of unused buildings at the former Olympic Stadium, another camp had been set up inside an arena abutting a soccer field. Surrounded by barbed wire, more than 1,300 migrants fended for themselves inside the dilapidated facility. Migrants said no one seemed to know how long they would stay or when they could move on.Along dingy, airless corridors thick with the odor of sweat, women lay on thin mats sleeping deeply as children wandered the area and young men whiled away the time playing soccer. On the floor, sewage had overflowed the day earlier, soaking some of the sleeping mats. Men and women formed long lines to get food prepared by a handful of volunteers who crowded a small kitchen, chopping tomatoes and scrambling to ensure that there was enough food to go around.Often there was not. In the parking lot outside the stadium, migrants mobbed cars driven up by good Samaritans who lived in the area and came to hand out bread, sweets and other food. Even if the border is closed, they need to eat, said Vangelis Vozikis, 55, who had come to distribute croissants.Many migrants seeking relief from the camps make their way to the center of Athens to Victoria Square, a tree-lined park where young men, mostly Afghans and Iranians, sleep under the open air as smugglers troll their ranks.Scores of Greeks wandered into the square, handing out supplies and homemade food. Later, migrants crowded around police officers as they brandished photos of the Olympic Center. Earlier in the day, the former baseball field had opened and the officers were trying to persuade the migrants to get on buses to go there for shelter and food.The sales pitch fell on deaf ears.We wont go, said Ahmed, a teenager from Afghanistan. We dont want to go anywhere until we know whether the borders will open."}
{"text": "Emilys D+Evolution(Concord)Whimsy gets weaponized on Esperanza Spaldings new album, Emilys D+Evolution. Ms. Spalding, hailed over the last decade as a springy jazz bassist and an irrepressible vocalist, has hardened her singer-songwriter ambitions and tightened her grip as a bandleader. The album  a sustained burst of funk enlightenment that rings with echoes of childhood  has its blind spots, but she sounds surer than ever of her footing.Theres a bolt of reinvention in these songs, which Ms. Spalding unveiled on tour last year, leading a band driven by electric bass and guitar. Funk the Fear, a syncopated yawp of defiance, represents the far end of this shift from lissome chamber-jazz to a muscular hybrid steeped in mid-1970s R&B, prog-rock and fusion (and, skipping ahead a bit, vintage Prince).Is there a concept here? Why yes, of course: Emilys D+Evolution combines Ms. Spaldings middle name, by which she was known as a child, with an awkward nod to regression. Onstage, she and her band perform the songs with theatrical staging, as if to highlight a spirit of playful artifice. You dont need to know more than that, though the premise explains why the sole cover here is I Want It Now, a tantrum in waltz time that appeared in the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. (Its Veruca Salts unwitting swan song, and implicitly a sharp critique.)Ms. Spalding has a fondness for tripping syllabics and a strong moralist streak: Her songs often turn outward rather than within, which can make her seem a figure of reproving judgment. (Again, Prince is relevant here.) But her musical insights are so lofty, and their execution so grounded, that most of these tracks are winners: surely Unconditional Love, a soulful entreaty, and One, which flirts with dubstep in the chorus and Joni Mitchell in the verses.Its hardly the only Joni-flection: Noble Nobles and Earth to Heaven have the complex harmony and coltish melodic phrasing of songs from Ms. Mitchells mid-to-late-70s albums. Those albums featured Ms. Mitchells magical rapport with the bassist Jaco Pastorius, and Ms. Spalding plays a fretless electric bass in a style indebted to his, making her both the Joni and the Jaco in this equation  a considerable feat.Against the contemporary landscape, who else is in Ms. Spaldings lane? She isnt a sensualist shape-shifter like FKA twigs or a subversive formalist like St. Vincent. Dont march up in your discerning shoes, she admonishes in Good Lava, but she still favors too many Wayne Shorterish chord progressions to truly suit the easily impressed. Its precisely when she stretches  as on Rest in Pleasure, which has a melody you wouldnt wish on a less acrobatic singer  that Ms. Spalding seems most ingenuous and unbound."}
{"text": "Easter is still weeks away, but pet stores may find that the added demand for rabbits the holiday brings will come early this year thanks to the irresistible Zootopia, an animated movie with an intrepid bunny named Judy Hopps at its core. Her fox sidekick, Nick Wilde, is mighty enjoyable, too.This film, action-packed and filled with enough savvy jokes that adults should consider slipping into the theater even if they dont have an accompanying child, is set in a world where animals have transcended the carnivore-and-prey dichotomy and now live together more or less harmoniously.Judy (the voice of Ginnifer Goodwin of Once Upon a Time), a country bunny, wants to become the first rabbit police officer in the bustling metropolis of Zootopia, but her parents are not exactly the follow-your-dreams type.If you dont try anything new, youll never fail, her father (Don Lake) tells her. Its a gag that encapsulates one of the best things about this film: It trusts young viewers to recognize the clichs theyve been fed by other animated movies over the years and to appreciate seeing them subverted.Judy graduates from the police academy and ends up on the force in Zootopia, but her boss (Idris Elba) relegates her to parking-ticket duty while more experienced officers investigate 14 missing-mammal cases. While obsessively writing tickets, Judy meets Nick (Jason Bateman), a world-weary hustler who slowly becomes her friend and adviser as she pokes her nose into the missing-mammal epidemic despite her bosss resistance.If youve seen the trailer for this delightful movie youve already had a taste of what might be the greatest takedown of bureaucratic ineptitude ever filmed. It involves a trip by Judy and Nick to the Department of Motor Vehicles, with its all-sloth staff. In the context of childrens movies, its a fairly daring scene, since in an otherwise fast-moving story the joke takes a loooong time to roll out. But it sure is worth it.Anyway, Judy learns some hard truths as she delves deeper into the mystery, and young viewers will, too. Chief among those is one adults know well: Being civilized doesnt mean tension and ugly thoughts disappear. Also, bringing about positive change isnt as easy as it seems.I came here to make the world a better place, Judy laments after her good intentions backfire, but I think I broke it.Funny, smart, thought-provoking  and musical, too. Shakira provides the voice of a pop star named Gazelle, and her vocals complete the package appealingly.Zootopia is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for gently rude humor and occasional scariness. Running time: 1 hour 48 minutes."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Contrary to A Bad Effort to Block Food Labels (editorial, Feb. 25), Senator Pat Robertss approach to dealing with mandatory genetically modified organism, or G.M.O., labeling is realistic, shows leadership and provides good guidance.If you consume anything with corn, it most likely came from a G.M.O. We have been safely consuming G.M.O. corn for over two decades. We also use or consume many other G.M.O. products in our daily lives. G.M.O.s are very safe to consume for both humans and animals, and have proven benefits for farmers, consumers and the environment.Vermonts decision to pass a mandatory G.M.O. labeling bill, swayed by scaremongering tactics rather than fact-based arguments, is unfortunate and jeopardizes the livelihoods of Vermonts small businesses, dairy farmers, food manufacturers and retailers.In the United States, standards for nutrition information labeling or ingredients are uniform for all states, set by the Food and Drug Administration after thorough research. Any regulation should be set on a national level, not by a patchwork of states. State-by-state labeling laws will not be consistent, making them very difficult for food manufacturers to comply with, and will unnecessarily increase consumer costs at the checkout line.The Council for Agricultural Science and Technology, a nonprofit organization, has published a report on potential impacts of mandatory food labeling of genetically modified food. The report substantiates that there is no science-based reason to single out G.M.O. foods and feeds for mandatory labeling.BRUCE W.

{"text": "The Challenge: Can you figure out what is wrong with a 36-year-old man who has had body aches for many years?Every month, the Diagnosis column of The New York Times Magazine asks Well readers to try to figure out a real-life diagnostic mystery. Below you will find the details of a case involving a middle-aged man with pains that seem to migrate from one joint to the next with no visible sign of injury.The route to the final diagnosis was particularly circuitous. Below, I provide most of the records that were available when the diagnosis was made. As usual, the first person to solve the case gets a signed copy of my book, Every Patient Tells a Story, and the pleasure of puzzling out a difficult mystery.Making a ListWhy dont we make a list? the young mans wife suggested. Her husband, tall and slender, had been moving restlessly around the kitchen, but when he heard her words, he came and sat next to her. He was 36 and, for the past 20 years, had been plagued by pains that moved from one joint to the next. Sometimes it was an ankle; sometimes a knee. It could be his back or his hand or his wrist. And sometimes it was all of the above.Over the years hed seen a phalanx of doctors. Theyd look him over, order an X-ray and then, seeing nothing, refer him to physical therapy. And hed get better.But then, within days or occasionally even weeks, something else would start up.It didnt seem right, his wife had said, over and over, during their years together. There had to be something else going on. Something bigger than whichever joint was hurting at the moment.The Patients StoryThe man had seen internists, orthopedists, rheumatologists. But after various thoughts and tests, none had seen a pattern that suggested anything more than the misfortune of frequent exercise-related injuries.His wife had Googled his symptoms many times, but the only diagnosis she ran across regularly was fibromyalgia, a chronic pain syndrome. When she read up on that condition, though, it just didnt seem to fit. Her husband sometimes had muscle pain, a characteristic of fibromyalgia, but most of the time his pain was in the joints themselves.The patient had resigned himself to these aches and pains. His wife, however, had not. A friend of hers whod suffered a lifetime of joint pain was recently given a diagnosis: rheumatoid arthritis. And that friend had enthusiastically recommended the doctor who had figured it out, a specialist in inflammatory diseases at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Call her, her friend urged. She figured out a diagnosis that had puzzled others for years.So she called. When her husbands appointment was a week away, she suggested that they put together a list of everything odd that had happened to him. She could start the list, and he could add anything she left out.An Expert OpinionThe day of the appointment, the wife tore the list out of her notebook and handed it to her husband. Dont forget to show this to the doctor, she urged.The man looked up when he heard his name called in the waiting room. The doctor smiled warmly as she walked toward him. She introduced herself and led him into the tiny exam room in the back. When she asked him about his medical history, he brought out his list.In addition to his migrating joint pain, hed had several other unusual medical problems that might be related. Most recently hed been given a diagnosis of von Willebrand disease, a disorder of the blood coagulation system. He found that out after nearly bleeding to death following a colonoscopy.He also had something called a geographic tongue. It wasnt painful but looked odd. Areas of the tongue surface somehow are injured, leaving smooth, red, angry-looking patches amid the tongues normally velvety pink surface. Someone had told him that geographic tongue was a sign of psoriasis, but psoriasis typically causes a scaly skin rash, and hed never had that. Plus he had scoliosis, or a curvature of the spine. He also had osteoporosis, even though everyone agreed he was way too young.His symptoms dated back some 20 years. As a teenager, his lung had suddenly ruptured, a condition known as a pneumothorax. Doctors had fixed the collapsed lung, but then it happened again. That second time theyd fixed it permanently. No one could explain why that happened.Indeed, no one could explain any of his weird medical problems.Other people in his family were sick, but not in the same way. His mother and brother had Crohns, a form of inflammatory bowel disease. Crohns disease usually causes bloody diarrhea, but it can also make your joints and muscles ache, so one of his doctors suspected he might have it too. Thats why the patient had been given that colonoscopy that had gone wrong. But it turned out he didnt have Crohns.Normal JointsAny redness or swelling in his painful joints?, the rheumatologist asked. Never, he told her.Any joint stiffness in the morning? None.Had he ever been tested for arthritis?, she asked. Oh, many times, he replied. The tests had all been negative.He never smoked, never drank, never used any illegal drugs. He hardly even took Tylenol. He was vegan and took vitamin B12 daily to make certain he didnt run out of this essential nutrient, which is found in meats. He was married, had two children (both pretty healthy) and worked as a lawyer. He exercised most days, even when his joints hurt.On exam, the doctor found a few clues. There was the geographic tongue hed already told her about. And his fingernails had tiny longitudinal ridges, something that can be normal but that is also seen in certain types of arthritis. However, his joints, the source of his main complaint, seemed completely normal. There was a little bit of tenderness in the sacroiliac joint, where the two bones that make up the hip girdle meet. However, even here there was no redness, no swelling, nothing abnormal.A Confusing PictureWhatever the patient had, it certainly wasnt obvious, the rheumatologist told him once hed gotten dressed.One possibility she was considering was a condition called psoriatic arthritis, or PsA, an unusual and aggressive type of inflammatory arthritis that can affect people with psoriasis. The geographic tongue, the ridged nails, the family history of Crohns disease were all seen in psoriatic arthritis. And in PsA, the usual tests for arthritis will be negative.But it wasnt a slam dunk. The patient clearly didnt have psoriasis  at least not yet. But the arthritis could precede the skin rash, sometimes by years. And although most people with psoriatic arthritis have pain, swelling and redness as well as severe bone destruction, some have only mild symptoms, like this man.Shed get some blood tests to look for inflammation, she told the patient, and gets X-rays to look for the kind of bony destruction psoriatic arthritis can cause. But even if those tests werent informative, she planned to start him on a very gentle medicine that was effective in reducing the pain and joint destruction.A Drug TrialThe blood tests and X-rays were unrevealing, and so at the next visit she started the patient on sulfasalazine, one of the oldest drugs used to treat both inflammatory arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases (like Crohns).He took the drug for three months. No relief. She gave it another few weeks. Still, nothing. Perhaps this wasnt an inflammatory arthritis after all.There was one final treatment she could try. If he didnt respond to a week of daily prednisone, a steroid pill, he wasnt likely to respond to any of the other anti-inflammatory medications used in the treatment of these diseases.The steroid did nothing but keep him awake at night. The constant roving joint pains continued unabated.The doctor was disappointed but clear. Whatever he had, it wasnt an inflammatory disease. She was sorry, but she didnt think she could help him.You can view the rheumatologists notes here.You can view the lab results here.Solving the MysteryThe patient was discouraged but not surprised. Yet another doctor was unable to figure out why he had all these weird problems. His wife was crushed. This doctor had figured out what was wrong with her friend; why not her husband? Maybe it was just fibromyalgia. Or just really bad luck.But the patient did end up getting a diagnosis. From an unexpected quarter. Can you figure out what this patient has?The first person to figure out the diagnosis will get a signed copy of my book, and that great feeling you get which you solve a tough case.Ill post the answer tomorrow.Rules and Regulations: Post your questions and diagnosis in the comments section below. The correct answer will appear Friday on Well. The winner will be contacted. Reader comments may also appear in a coming issue of The New York Times Magazine."}
{"text": "The sophisticated take on Mitt Romneys remarkable broadside against Donald Trumps policy positions, business acumen and personal morals this morning is that it was an unforced blunder thatprobably only helps Trump. After all, who more than Romney embodies the establishment that Trumps followers so despise? Who more than Romney, who lost to Obama in a race most Republicans expected to win, embodies the lack of winning that Trump has so skillfully attacked? How can Romney of all people, a scion of wealth and a frequent flip-flopper, be the right person to press the case that Trump is an unprincipled silver-spooner? And didnt Romney accept Trumps endorsement just four short years ago?These are good questions, but let me make a perhaps-unsophisticated counterpoint.We live in a political world where much of the Republican Party spent six months telling itself that it didnt really need to persuade Trump voters not to vote for Trump, that his candidacy would simply fall apart on his own. Now many of those same geniuses have decided that its now too late to persuade voters not to vote for Trump, that theyre beyond the reach of reason, and that any attempt to talk them out of their fascination will just make them angrier and more Trump-besotted.Which for some of them it no doubt will. Butif you think your voters are about to make a catastrophic, even republic-threatening mistake, dont you have an obligation to actually, at some point in the process, make that case to them? Just for a few weeks, at least, before you give up in dismay?The idea that it cant be done, that Trump voters are all locked-in lunatics with no capacity to take in new information, seems like just another versionof the elite condescension toward rank and file Republicans that enabled Trumps rise in the first place. And in that contextRomneys speech was actually an admirable, long-overdue attempt to break with that condescension, to treat primary voters as adults, to actually share with them the wide range of reasons  and Romney covered the waterfront  why Donald Trump does not deserve their trust.Was he the best person imaginable to give the speech? No, but he might have been the best person available.He was the partys last nominee for president. He isnt running for president this time (we think; lets see where things stand at the convention), so his arguments are less likely to seem flailing and self-interested. Hes still popular with Republicans, and he has a gravitas that both Cruz and Rubio lack; hes a flip-flopper, but nobody doubts his patriotism; he can drive media attention in a way that, say, Ben Sasse cannot. And many Trump voters, believe it or not, were Romney stalwartsin the 2012 primary. (He isnt only winning over working class Republicans; theres a strong we like that hes a businessman element to Trumps appeal as well.) In the late fall, months into Trumps ascendancy, the BostonGlobe polled New Hampshire and found that if Romney were in the race hed be leading Trump by 31 percent to 15 percent. The idea that hed be automatically tuned out by those same voters now may seem intuitive, but it lacks empirical support.Again, in an ideal world the Republican Party would have someone more effectivethan Romney a successful, popular two-term president, lets say available to make the honest brokers #neverTrump pitch. Butwe dont live in that world; what the party has in its post-George W. Bush brokenness are various compromised figures, none of whom are ideal anti-Trumps. And I do think Romneys speech would have been better much better, to my mind if he had acknowledged as much, by admittinghis own mistake in accepting Trumps endorsement four years ago,and casting his intervention now as, in part, an act of penance.But better what he did offer than the nothing, or the outright capitulation, that many figuresassociated with Republican politics seem to be offering instead. The idea that Trump cant be beaten is insane; the idea that he shouldnt be beaten is immoral; the idea that it isnt worth even trying to beat him is the lamest thing Ive ever seen in politics. So good on Romney for trying:All that is necessary for the triumph of Trump, it would seem, is for partymen to do nothing while telling themselves, mournfully, that there just wasnt anything to be done."}
{"text": "For a dozen years, the World Trade Center Transportation Hub was a train wreck. Santiago Calatravas winged dove, beefed up to meet security demands, devolved into a dino carcass. The projects cost soared toward a head-slapping, unconscionable $4 billion in public money for what, in effect, is the 18th-busiest subway stop in New York City, tucked inside a shopping mall, down the block from another shopping center.And its not really a hub. A maze of underground passages connects the site to far-flung subway lines, but there are not free transfers. The place is a glorified PATH station for some 50,000 weekday riders commuting to and from New Jersey. Predictions by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built the hub, that this number will somehow double when the site opens seem as reliable as the authoritys initial promises that the project would take five years and cost $2.2 billion.But wait. The hub opens on Thursday, or at least a part of it is opening, including most of the main hall, or Oculus, as its called. And at first blush, Mr. Calatravas architecture can almost  almost  make you forget what an epic boondoggle the whole thing has been. That virgin view, standing inside the Oculus and gazing up, is a jaw-dropper.Curved, steel-ribbed walls rise 160 feet like a pair of immense clamshells toward a ribbon of glass that is the giant halls skylight. I visited the other morning, when sun spilled through windows between the ribs, dancing with the dust motes, splintering into fingered beams. It poured through the skylight, whose glass panes can slide open. I could imagine some poetic-minded, devil-may-care soul at the Port Authority allowing a shimmering scrim of snowflakes to waft down into the hall and dissolve on the vast white marble floor.Of course, todays pristine new cathedral of public space soon becomes the temple ground for another Apple store and John Varvatos. Shops move in later this year. The Oculus will be leased out as an event space. The authority needs to recoup the fortune it will spend on white paint to keep the place from instantly looking shabby.Assuming the best, commuters will head to bright, inviting train platforms  picking up a carton of orange juice and a copy of The New York Times at a Hudson News stand  and the hub will not suggest some bloated Soviet folly, a pretend Palace of the People testifying to broken government and chutzpah.Well see.Meanwhile, the city has an Instagram-ready attraction whose defenders insist no one will remember it is the most expensive train station ever. Who recalls how much Grand Central cost?Actually, I do. It cost $80 million, or about half the cost of the hub, adjusting for inflation, which was private, not public, money. Grand Central spurred a building boom that transformed the surrounding blocks and the citys economy. This new hub is shoehorned into an unfinished office park in Lower Manhattan whose development it has complicated, not hastened  while the whole area has been evolving into a livelier live-work neighborhood despite whats happening at the World Trade Center, not because of it.I said at first blush. The genius of Grand Central, which accommodates many times the number of riders as the hub, entails more than that uplifting wow moment encountering its lofty main concourse. It is expressed in the ingenuity of its layout, its integration with the streets, the serendipity of its art, the richness and variety of its materials and ancillary spaces. It remains an endless discovery, even a century later.And it works.The downtown hub is not Grand Central. Any really big or unusual object or immense hole in the ground triggers awe. Mr. Calatrava is a sometimes very inspired sculptor of structural engineering. His best projects are rail stations. Ive long admired the modest one he designed for Zurich years ago, which accomplished a lot with relatively little.But he has become a one-trick pony. The World Trade Center Hub conjures up his station in Lyon, France, and his museum in Milwaukee. Aside from the obvious Pantheon allusion, I no longer know what the hub is supposed to mean, symbolically, with its now-thickened ribs, hunkered torso and angry snouts on either end, weirdly compressing the entrances from the street. Its like a Pokmon. Think of Eero Saarinens skylights at Kennedys TWA terminal, which resolve so elegantly into big, playful porthole windows. The imagery is clear. Thats great architecture.Through those street entrances to the hub, the Oculus reveals itself all at once from awkward, tongue-shaped balconies. Mr. Calatrava gives the whole view away. The trip downstairs becomes a letdown. Its better coming up from the PATH trains, where riders pass through a kind a vestibule (beneath the tracks for the No. 1 train) before stepping up to the nave of the Oculus, which appears suddenly, obliquely. It may put you in mind of entering the Guggenheim, with its sequence of compression and release, except there, space continues to unfold and surprise you along the ramp.In its scale, monotony of materials and color, preening formalism and disregard for the gritty urban fabric, the hub is the sort of object-building that might seem at home on the Washington Mall. Its cramped mezzanine, where daily life should thrum, precludes the sort of bars and restaurants that have made the terraces at Grand Central a destination and heartbeat of the neighborhood. Westfield Group, which oversees retail at the hub, doesnt intend for there to be cafes with tables spilling across the floor of the Oculus. So the hub clearly wont be like the Galleria in Milan or the Piazza  San Marco in Venice. Or even like the Hauptbahnhof in Berlin.I toured the site recently with an architect who admired Mr. Calatrava for sticking to his guns and conceiving an ambitious public space. Cost was the Port Authoritys responsibility, he said, and besides, cost isnt value, all of which is true.Mr. Calatrava has given New York something for its billions. But if the takeaway lesson from this project is that architects need a free pass, a vain, submissive client and an open checkbook to create a public spectacle, then the hub is a disaster for architecture and for cities.Follow Michael Kimmelman on Twitter: @kimmelmanThe World Trade Center Transportation Hub can be reached by subway: Take the 2 or 3 train to Park Place, and then walk west. Or you can take the PATH!"}
{"text": "A decade ago, Martin F. Horn, then the commissioner of the New York City Correction Department, came up with a novel plan to close the worst of the jails on Rikers Island and replace them with state-of-the-art facilities in the Bronx and Brooklyn.They would feature natural lighting, air-conditioning, the latest security technology and, on the ground floor of the Brooklyn jail, a full block of retail space. A glossy rendering depicted that 1,700-bed jail fully integrated into the community, with well-dressed New Yorkers strolling past a Boss, a United Colors of Benetton and a Trader Joes.Mr. Horn took his proposal to churches and mosques, community activists, City Council members and leaders of the local political machines. Rikers Island, he told them, could not be fixed. Human waste bubbled into cells; overheated buildings put inmates and officers on edge; gang members broke off pieces of the radiators and sharpened them into weapons.At first, the idea of closing Rikers seemed to appeal to people, Mr. Horn said, but when they realized it could mean building jails in their neighborhoods, the mood turned. A fierce grass-roots opposition led by local activist groups like Community in Unity and Green Workers Cooperatives came together to quash the proposal.I was buzz-sawed, Mr. Horn said.In recent weeks, the idea of closing Rikers Island, the sprawling jail complex in the middle of the East River, has once again become a central topic of public discourse, with both Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and the Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, arguing that it is the surest way to put an end to the brutality and dysfunction inside city jails. Supporters of the plan envision whittling down the citys inmate population, already at historical lows, and then dispersing the inmates still incarcerated, including those charged with the most serious crimes, to a constellation of modern neighborhood jails in easy proximity to families, lawyers and courthouses.But can it actually be done this time? Skeptics, including Mayor Bill de Blasio, argue that while the idea is a noble one, in practice it is highly unlikely to be realized: to succeed would require years if not decades, billions of dollars and enormous political capital, while distracting from efforts to address immediate problems facing the jails.City Hall officials have pointed out that it would not be the governor or the speaker who would bear most of the responsibility for pulling off such a daunting task; it would be the mayor.Over the last two years, in the face of relentless scrutiny of conditions at Rikers by local and federal law enforcement agencies as well as the media, the mayor has allocated hundreds of millions of dollars to improve conditions and reduce the violence. Early on, Mr. de Blasio appointed a correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, with a national reputation as a jail reformer. In October, the administration settled a federal lawsuit over brutality at the jails that among other things called for improved training of officers, thousands of additional surveillance cameras and oversight by a court-appointed monitor.Closing Rikers does not close the jail system, and we need to fix whats inside these buildings  wherever we put them, Anthony E. Shorris, the first deputy mayor, said recently.Most discussions about closing Rikers begin with the question of how to shrink the current population. On any given day, there are 10,000 inmates, mostly housed in nine jails on the island. Though that number is roughly half of the jails population in the 1990s, city officials have been trying to figure out how to drive it down further.They have come up with two main avenues for accomplishing this. The first is to expand diversion programs and change the bail system to prevent people arrested for minor offenses, like jumping a turnstile or smoking marijuana, from being sent to jail in the first place. The other is to speed up the court process so that people charged with the most serious crimes can have their cases adjudicated more quickly and either be released or be sent to serve their sentences in upstate prisons.Doing all of this will require extraordinary levels of coordination among the police, the state courts and prisons, prosecutors and defense lawyers, as well as the Correction Department. City studies have concluded that aggressive efforts by all the parties involved could lead to the inmate populations being reduced by about 3,000, but that contraction would take five to 10 years.Assuming that crime rates, which are lower than ever, do not rise, that would leave 6,500 to 7,000 inmates to be housed in the community  mainly those charged with the most serious crimes or serving a sentence of a year or less.Currently there are jails in Brooklyn and Manhattan along with a barge moored in the East River that inmates call the Boat. The three facilities have a capacity of about 2,000. There is also a jail in Queens that is being used only for training, partly because the Correction Department academy is so overcrowded that recruits must attend classes in three shifts, with the last one ending around midnight.Like Rikers, these borough jails are so badly outdated and dilapidated they would probably have to be torn down and rebuilt, officials said. The Queens jail was closed in 2003 because it failed to meet basic state standards; it has only a small area on the roof for recreation, and no rooms for rehabilitative programs. The configuration of Brooklyns jail makes it hard for guards to monitor what is happening in cells.At one time, the San Francisco jail system, which is now recognized as a national model, was just as bad. After a boiler failed at one jail, instead of repairing it, the city parked a truck outside for 10 years to supply hot water. Broken windows were covered with plastic wrap. Even after a federal judge ruled the jail unfit for human habitation, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors repeatedly resisted building a new one.In the end it took more than a quarter-century  from 1979, when the idea was first proposed, until 2006  to open a new, 760-bed jail with glass doors instead of bars and a semicircular layout that allows one guard to monitor 24 cells at once.In New York, City Hall estimates that building new jails would cost about a million dollars a cell, meaning a total of $5 billion to $7 billion, to replace Rikers, assuming the inmate population can be significantly reduced.Even if the money were to become available, officials would face sizable political obstacles from New Yorkers who do not want to live next door to a jail.For the last year, the de Blasio administration has been exploring options for moving 200 adolescents off Rikers to conform with the federal court settlement. But even with such a small number of inmates, officials have struggled to find a site that would be acceptable to future neighbors.Ms. Mark-Viverito, the Council speaker, has established a commission, led by the states former chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, to recommend proposals for criminal justice reforms, including closing Rikers. The commission is not expected to produce a report for at least a year.I feel very strongly about this, said Ms. Mark-Viverito, who, like Mr. de Blasio, is a Democrat. Its overdue. I know its a big challenge. Im not afraid to take on big challenges. Big thinking and out-of-the-box thinking is the way that we arrive at progress.Asked if she would be supportive of a jail being built in her East Harlem district, Ms. Mark-Viverito said that it was too early to say, but that her community was already oversaturated with social services. She said other neighborhoods should start doing their fair share.While Ms. Mark-Viverito proposed the idea of closing Rikers last month in her State of the City address, it is Governor Cuomos support of the idea that has generated much of the public attention.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who has clashed frequently with Mr. de Blasio, has no authority over city jails, which are funded through the municipal budget. Nor has he spoken to the mayors staff about the proposal.The governor is facing his own crisis in the state prisons. In June, two murderers escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, N.Y., near the Canadian border, exposing security lapses that were years in the making. At the time, the 170-year-old maximum-security prison had no surveillance cameras built into the cellblocks, which is standard technology at more modern facilities. The New York Times has reported on allegations of brutality by corrections officers at prisons across the state, including the deaths of three inmates following violent confrontations with guards.Mr. Horn, the former commissioner, said that while support from the governor and the Council speaker to close Rikers would be helpful, he still did not think it would happen.It can be done physically, it can be done programmatically, its good policy, Mr. Horn said. But I dont think its any more politically feasible today than it was then.Bernard B. Kerik, another former correction commissioner, put it this way: Who wants a 1,600-bed facility in their community?"}
{"text": "Governments around the world have built over the last few years a vast new system of rules that would allow banking giants to fail and shield taxpayers from bailouts.Though this new regulatory architecture is eye-numbingly complex, its builders contend that it has made the financial system much safer without having to resort to measures like forcing a breakup of the largest banks.But that reassuring view has taken a beating of late.Recent turmoil in European debt markets pointed to a possible weakness in a crucial part of the new regulatory system.Shares of large banks have been under pressure, trading at valuations that indicate investors have little faith in the companies sprawling business models.Some mergers-and-acquisitions bankers on Wall Street are privately beginning to conclude that some of the largest banks may break up in the coming years.Then, last month, a new Federal Reserve official surprised many by declaring in his first speech on the job that the too big to fail problem had not been solved.The assertion was surprising because the official, Neel Kashkari, was at the Treasury Department in 2008 during the big bailouts. But having had time to survey the overhaul ushered in by the Dodd-Frank Act, he says that he believes more has to be done. We need to act while we still remember how painful the crisis was, Mr. Kashkari said in an interview.Those behind the financial overhaul might be forgiven for being taken aback by the skepticism. They have achieved many important goals, and there are signs that the new regulations are causing the banks to shrink and, over time, they may even break themselves up to satisfy their shareholders.The gradualism of the current overhaul has a steely edge that the banks and their lobbyists have, for the most part, not been able to resist, supporters of the new rules also point out.Still, the largest banks remain huge.For instance, four United States banks have more than $1 trillion of assets, and two have more than $2 trillion. And now, if the fresh doubts about the overhaul grow, and market turbulence continues to weigh on the banks, politicians and regulators may press for much more direct policies to reduce the size and complexity of the largest financial firms.Mr. Kashkari, who in January became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, has also started an initiative aimed at developing a plan to address the too-big-to-fail issue.Its a hard question, and I give Neel a lot of credit for wanting to drill down, said Phillip L. Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, who was an assistant secretary for economic policy under Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr.Officials at regional Fed banks do not write new banking regulations; that is the job of staff members of the Federal Reserve in Washington. Yet Mr. Kashkaris intervention makes it more likely that the debate over the banks will continue through the presidential election, in which Wall Street may become a prominent issue.The regulators should take very seriously the fact that the public is still overwhelmingly skeptical of whether these reforms have fundamentally changed anything, said Sheila C. Bair, a former prominent banking regulator who is now president of Washington College.Proponents of the current overhaul contend that much has been done.Compared with 2008, the big banks have much higher levels of capital, which in practice means they use less debt to finance their loans and trades  a change that should make them more resilient to shocks and losses.Banks are also safer because they use far less of a type of borrowing that can evaporate in a crisis, causing a run. At Bank of America, for instance, this short-term borrowing was at the end of last year equivalent to just over 18 percent of the banks assets, compared with nearly 36 percent at the end of 2008.And the higher capital requirements  which rise in line with a banks size  appear to be pressing big banks to shrink. JPMorgan Chase, the nations largest bank by assets, trimmed $220 billion of assets last year, done, in part, in response to stiffer capital regulations.When given the leeway under Dodd-Frank, regulators have mostly gone for a stricter approach. The Volcker Rule, which aims to stop a banks traders from making risky wagers for its own profit , ended up being quite stringent, for example.And the Fed may not be done.It may, for instance, decide to use its annual regulatory stress tests to make capital rules more onerous.And big banks have to submit plans that would act as a road map for regulators if the banks collapsed. If the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, another bank regulator, conclude that these plans are not credible, they can require remedial actions that include making the bank unload some of its businesses.In the coming weeks, the Fed and the F.D.I.C. will announce the results of their latest assessments.One of the most potent criticisms of the overhaul, however, is that it is too clever by half.This point is directed in particular at a very important part of the overhaul that is intended to make it possible to wind down a dying bank without using taxpayer backing.Under this part of the overhaul, banks have to issue debt that can be turned into equity capital when a bank fails. The idea is that the debt would act as a source of new capital for the seized bank, removing the need for taxpayer funds.But some banking experts say this part of the overhaul might spread panic, not contain it. Before the collapse, the price of this debt could start to plunge in the markets. Investors might then flee the ailing bank and stop lending to other banks, even those that are in better shape.Mr. Kashkari asserts that, to reduce the risk of such contagion, it may make sense to not rely on the debt component and instead just have banks hold a lot more equity capital at the outset.Why not get rid of all this complexity and ambiguity and make it equity? he asked.Such concerns gained some credibility after recent movements in the prices of special debt securities issued by large European banks. In a crunch, these securities can be transformed into pure equity capital. Those issued by Deutsche Bank fell steeply in price, prompting selling of similar securities issued by other banks.But making the banks finance themselves with more equity could cause their stock prices to fall even more than they have. To those who favor doing more, however, such a decline may underscore that banks still need to shrink in order to improve their profitability.Mr. Kashkari said he recognized that a stricter overhaul could add new costs to the banks, and he added that taxpayers might still need to bear some of the risks embedded in the banking sector. But he argued that voters had not yet been given a clear choice on that question.I want to be candid with the American people about which piece we have solved, and which piece we have not solved, he said. And we as a country could decide that we have done enough."}
{"text": "THE South by Southwest festival in March is always an exciting time for news about music, films and ideas.The giant event in Austin, Tex., also features SXSW Interactive, which is dedicated to start-up companies and technology discussions.Keeping tabs on the sprawling start-up scene at the five days of SXSW Interactive and beyond is tricky, but apps can help you navigate the landscape.Startup News is a useful news roundup app that is free on iOS. It aggregates news about start-up topics like innovation, entrepreneurship, mergers, acquisitions and venture capital.The app has a clear, readable interface and does a good job of combining images, headlines and introductory paragraphs. As well as aggregating relevant news on one page, the app organizes news articles under topics youre interested in. Tapping on an article shows you a little more of its content; you can visit the source website to read the full article.The app has a broad range of sources so its great for scanning up-to-the-minute headlines.This is an iOS-only app, however, and while its good for quickly reading news snippets, it may not be the best app for finding in-depth articles about start-ups.There is an Android app with the same name that does a similar job. It has many of the same features as the iOS Startup News app, including a bright and readable interface and many news sources.This app does show a bit more news content, without requiring a visit to the articles website. It is also free and a good way to follow developments in the start-up community.Entrepreneur Daily is a start-up app worth downloading for two reasons. First, it has a magazinelike design and contains longer articles.The app also includes inspiration, advice and ideas. So if you are actually participating in a start-up or eager to gain a deeper insight into start-ups, it could be more useful than a news aggregator app.The apps clear interface highlights images and makes it easy to filter articles by date, topic or popularity and share them on social media.The app is free on iOS and Android, but because news is not its focus, it may be best used with other start-up apps.Twitter soared in popularity because of SXSW. But it can seem daunting or even pointless if youve never tried it.Dont be afraid. Twitter is easy to learn, and its a great source of news on the start-up scene (including fresh news from events like SXSW).The whole point of Twitter is to be a continuous live source of discussions, links to articles and ideas shared by its users. To use Twitter you set up a simple profile and search Twitters database for topics or people to follow  be they journalists, venture capitalists or even leaders of start-up companies.Twitter is a great way to learn about news developments very early, sometimes ahead of any other sources. And one of the most interesting things about Twitter is how many influential people from the start-up community use it regularly.Twitter is free on iOS, Android and Windows 10.The news aggregator app Flipboard is one of my favorite ways to follow a topic because its gesture-based interface makes it very easy to browse articles.The app can pull together news on many topics, including a subject like start-ups, venture capital and entrepreneurship. Flipboard is free on iOS and Android.Finally, if youre a devoted LinkedIn user, the Pulse app may be an interesting source of start-up news.Like its rivals, Pulse collects news articles from many sources with a business-related theme. The app learns your preferences as you swipe right to save articles or left to indicate your disinterest.The app isnt specifically about delivering start-up news to you, but its an interesting way of speed-reading each days business happenings, including start-up-related articles.

{"text": "A New York City police horse tossed an officer to the pavement and took off down a busy Midtown street on Wednesday after being spooked by a loud noise, the authorities said.The police said a sergeant was riding the horse, named Gunny, on 48th Street between Sixth and Seventh Avenues around 7:25 p.m. when the animal was frightened by a sudden sound from a truck that was being unloaded nearby.The officer, still connected to the horse through his stirrup, was dragged on the ground before managing to get himself loose, the police said. He was taken to a hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, they added.The horse ran free as some onlookers took to social media to share their reactions.Theres an escaped police horse running against traffic in Times Square, a comedy writer, Mike Scollins, wrote on Twitter, calling it insane.Just called 911, as a beautiful police horse galloped past us on W. 48th St. and headed in wrong direction South on 6th Avenue! Daniel Kerin wrote on Facebook.About 10 minutes after Gunny broke free, mounted police officers secured the horse at 47th Street and Seventh Avenue, where it apparently had come to a stop on its own.New York City has one of the largest mounted units in the country, though it has been reduced over the years. Many other cities have simply shut down mounted units altogether.Horses are prized for the added height they give officers, increasing both the officers ability to see and their visibility to crowds.But the animals occasionally get spooked by New York Citys loud sounds. In 2015 for example, an officer landed in the hospital with an ankle injury after being bucked from a horse frightened by a band during the Greek Independence Day Parade, The Daily News reported. The year before that, a horse ran loose around 44th Street and Sixth Avenue after it was startled by a garbage truck.Horses do get startled with loud noises, no matter how professionally trained they are, a police spokesman said."}

{"text": "Many hospitals give probiotics to patients, even though there is little evidence that these so-called beneficial bacteria are safe and effective.In a nationwide study of 145 hospitals from 2006 to 2012, 96 percent gave patients probiotics. A total of 51,723, or 2.6 percent of patients discharged, had received them.Probiotics are marketed as dietary supplements and, unlike drugs, do not require the approval of the Food and Drug Administration. They are commonly given for digestive health, but a recent randomized, double-blind study found that they were no more effective than placebos for treating the diarrhea associated with antibiotic use or C. difficile infection.The hospital study, in the American Journal of Infection Control, found that most hospitals used Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus, and seven other strains were used as well, in varying combinations. Most patients had a primary diagnosis of infectious, inflammatory or gastrointestinal conditions, but people with skin and urinary tract infections, congestive heart failure, osteoarthritis and other conditions were given probiotics as well. More than 500 children under a year old were treated with probiotics.Its understandable that people want to use probiotics, said the lead author, Sarah H. Yi, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But the benefits are uncertain. Theres no research that definitively shows they are effective, certainly not enough to create guidelines for their use."}
{"text": "Does the size of Donald Trumps penis matter?Im not being cheeky. Im not being shocking. Im noting something that we cannot lose track of, should not shrug our shoulders about and must not gloss over: Trump has succeeded at nothing as fully as he has at infusing the presidential race with a vulgarity thats absolutely breathtaking.He has done so well at dragging his rivals so far down into the sewer with him that portions of what we watched on Thursday night were a fetid farce. We actually witnessed an interchange  in the first 10 minutes, no less  about how well endowed (or not) he is.Its worth stopping for a second, letting that sink in and wondering what it says about our country and political process right now.Heres how it happened: One of the moderators upbraided Marco Rubio (rightly) for abandoning incessant pledges of a positive campaign, answering Trumps schoolyard taunts with adolescent jokes and jabs of his own, and even going so far as to claim that Trump had wet his pants under the pressure at the prior debate.Trump butted in to take special issue with one of Rubios digs.He hit my hands, Trump said, alluding to Rubios assertion that they were small and correctly noting that Rubio had insinuated that if theyre small, something else must be small.Trump lifted his chin. Puffed up his chest.I guarantee you theres no problem, he said. I guarantee.There is absolutely a problem, and Im going to be careful here not to characterize it as big or small or use any adjective related to size. The problem is that Trump, Rubio, Ted Cruz and John Kasich were on the stage in Detroit to debate their qualifications for the most powerful job in the world, at the helm of its most important democracy, and Trump and Rubio werent just hitting, but also dwelling, below the belt.Surreal. Sickening.So, yes, the size of Trumps penis matters  or, rather, what matters is that it was an actual subject of discussion; that it reflected and set the tone of the encounter; and that this tone favors Trump, because its where he lives, its his kingdom, and if rivals join him there, they merely become his subjects.Can Fox News be the host of every G.O.P. debate from now on?Remember the first debate of this election cycle, when there were more than double this number of candidates and the night opened with Foxs moderators confronting all of them, one by one, with what were seen as their greatest vulnerabilities and flaws?The moderators were similarly merciless on Thursday night, at least when it came to Trump, and Trump was the rightful focus  the whole show. They hounded him about his inconsistencies, his lies, his lack of specificity  all of it.If substance can pull Trumps voters away from him, the moderators set that up to happen. If substance can prevent undecided voters from lining up behind Trump, the moderators gave them a firm nudge in the opposite direction.And nothing about Trumps overly defensive, excessively pouty and sometimes outright mendacious performance beckoned those voters to his side. Although there were moments when his ability to maintain his composure was heroic, there were as many or more when he grew flustered, reddened, sputtered and resorted to insult, looking tinier than I thought that a man who stands well over 6 feet tall could.Fittingly, he reached his nadir under interrogation from Megyn Kelly, his nemesis from that first debate. The subject was fraud charges against Trump University, and every time he tried to portray them as baseless and the school and its students as the happiest place this side of Disneyland, Kelly pushed back. Confronted him with contrary evidence. Corrected his selective, self-serving version.Her victory was clear when Trump pivoted from defending himself to pummeling Rubio, saying that if fraud was the topic, Rubios poor record of attendance in the Senate should be examined.He scammed the people of Florida, Trump said. He defrauded the people of Florida.Of no small relevance: Florida, which votes on March 15th, is a winner-take-all primary. Rubio has staked his campaign  his reputation  on winning it. But in polls there, Trump remains in the lead.Do Trumps voters really care how closely he hews to Republican and conservative orthodoxy?Cruz and Rubio keep making this assumption. They made it anew on Thursday night.Once again and at great length, Cruz recited the list of liberal Democrats to whom Trump had contributed over the years, dwelling in particular on how many checks hed written to Hillary Clinton and asking an excellent question: How would Trump be able to campaign effectively against someone whom hed supported and demonstrated such excitement about in the past?Rubio denounced Trump as someone whose positions are not conservative. He mentioned Trumps defense of Planned Parenthood. He disparaged Trumps commitment to national defense.And in the days leading up the debate, a rapidly growing, increasingly prominent chorus of Republican standard bearers made that same hes-no-Republican argument, detailing the ways in which Trump betrays conservative principles. This was a component of Mitt Romneys message when he delivered his extraordinary speech on Thursday, telling Republicans that this was a time of reckoning and that if they dont say no to Trump, theyre saying yes to the demise of the Republican Party and, possibly, the country.But heres the problem: Trumps voters arent with him because hes the purest conservative. Trump is their protest vote, and part of what theyre protesting is preoccupations of the Republican Party that havent improved or been immediately relevant to their lives. Theyre protesting foreign wars, free trade and the coddling of corporations, and some of Trumps apostasies are precisely what draw them to him.Republican leaders failure to take down Trump isnt simply a function of hesitancy  its not just about waiting too long. Its about their own lack of credibility and authority with the part of the electorate thats defying them.Is it now officially three against one?One of the most fascinating dynamics of the debate was the degree to which Cruz, Rubio and Kasich declined to go after one another, no longer angling to emerge as the single Trump alternative but working harder instead to erode Trumps support, no matter where that support went.In debates past, Cruz and Rubio were at each others throats. On Thursday night, they were practically arm in arm, tag-teaming Trump.This supported the notion that none of Trumps rivals maintains much hope anymore of exceeding his delegate count; what theyre banking on is the ability to gather enough delegates between them, and to hold Trumps tally in check, so that he finishes with a plurality but not a majority and the nominee is decided at the convention.Could some good yet come of Trumps place in the race?Im going to play Pollyanna, minus the long blond hair and the bow, and remark on a refreshing development over the last few weeks and especially days. More emphatically and unequivocally than at any recent juncture that I can recall, Republican leaders and standard bearers are saying that their party has no tolerance for any racism, no room for any sexism, no forgiveness for bigotry.There have always been Republicans, many of them, who felt this way passionately, but they often spoke in muffled voices or chose to keep silent. There were racist, sexist, bigoted voters whom they were all too happy to have. A party needs to reach the 50-percent mark to win elections, and it makes ugly deals and unseemly compromises to cross that threshold.But disgust with Trump and a recognition of the damage that he could do have prompted many of the Republican Partys stewards to make unwavering statements and articulate principles that theyll be judged by  and maybe even have to live up to  down the line.Trump has reconnected them with their soul or rather, if you want to be a cynic, forced them to find one.Maybe the detour down his pants will amount to something more and better, in the end, than phallic braggadocio."}

{"text": "TAMPA, Fla.   On his first swing of the exhibition season, Alex Rodriguez launched a drive down the left-field line that was so deep and majestic he felt compelled to hold his follow-through for a moment, pausing to admire it.As the ball sailed over the wall, the otherwise quiet crowd at Steinbrenner Field rose to applaud as Rodriguez made his familiar, loping, no-hurry-to-get-there jog around the bases.The sight was a comforting one for the Yankees, who have had few others during their first two games, knowing that their lineups 40-year-old anchor arrived with his sharp eye and smooth swing as intact as his flair for the dramatic.It was nice to see, said Manager Joe Girardi, whose team lost to Philadelphia, 13-4, on Thursday. I hope it happens a lot more.Rodriguez, who hit his homer off the left-hander Adam Morgan, struck out and walked in his other two plate appearances. He expressed surprise that his first swing against live pitching had sent the ball out of the park.When asked if that was why he stood and watched the ball, he laughed.I mean, Ive been doing that for a long time, Rodriguez said. I do the same thing on a pop-up to short.He added: Obviously, youre not looking to hit home runs this early in the spring or even to drive the ball. Youre looking to see the ball well, put good swings on it. Theres going to be some good days and bad days. I think, for me, the biggest thing for me is I dont have any distractions. Im clearheaded. Im coming in with a good attitude every day and I understand how to have a purpose.Rodriguez was underscoring the contrast between this year and last, when he arrived to a litany of questions after being suspended for the 2014 season for his role in the Biogenesis scandal.While a healthy, productive Rodriguez would be a boon to the Yankees, a handful of developments could turn out to be worrisome if they persist.Jacoby Ellsbury, the oft-injured center fielder who has missed the tail end of his two previous spring trainings with injuries, will not make his debut until Saturday after asking for a few more days to get his legs in shape.Its important that that doesnt happen, Girardi said of another Ellsbury injury. That he is strong going into the season and not have something nagging, so that he gets a lot of at-bats the last couple weeks.A bullpen that must make do without closer Aroldis Chapman for the first 30 games, after his suspension in a domestic violence case, has had few encouraging performances in the first two games. After Nick Rumbelow and Nick Goody were cuffed around by the Tigers on Wednesday, Anthony Swarzak and James Pazos were hit hard by the Phillies. But at least their pitches were close enough to the plate to get hit: Jacob Lindgren, returning from surgery to clear bone spurs from his elbow  the same operation that Masahiro Tanaka underwent  faced five batters, walking three and hitting another.Im sure there were some nerves, Girardi said. Im sure he was overthrowing a little bit.The Yankees have used 15 pitchers in two games and only one  the right-hander Mark Montgomery  has had a clean score line.Dellin Betances, who used a strong spring in 2014 to make the Yankees, can empathize with the relievers competing for what could be three vacancies in the bullpen. He was once one of them.Its a big difference, Betances said. I can enjoy spring training a little more. Im more at ease. You dont stress a bad outing. Its just about getting ready as opposed to trying to come out of the gate hot. I think these guys all know there are some spots available.Meanwhile, Rodriguezs ease was visible in his swing, in his trot around the bases and in his mood afterward. Now is just preparing for the tests ahead. He will have Friday off.One thing is proving that you can do it and the other thing is proving that your health can be maintained for a long time, Rodriguez said.He added: I think with me, health is of the essence and, obviously, pacing yourself. I understand the job that I have to do, and I know how to get it done.INSIDE PITCHMasahiro Tanaka will make his first start of spring training Sunday at the Phillies. Michael Pineda will pitch Monday against Houston, C. C. Sabathia will pitch Tuesday at the Marlins and Ivan Nova will pitch against the Mets on Wednesday in Port St. Lucie. Nathan Eovaldi, who felt tightness in his groin last week, will start March 10 in a split-squad game against Toronto. ... Nova, battling for a spot in the starting rotation, gave up a run-scoring double in the first inning but pitched well after that, retiring the next four batters he faced."}
{"text": "It was a moment that some feared might never come, after so many years of viewing the St. Patricks Day Parade from the outside, politically and personally.This year will be different.Now that a group representing gay Irish-Americans will march in the parade, activists choked up on Thursday as they recounted their battle, and celebrated Bill de Blasios decision to march in the parade for the first time as mayor.Perhaps our hearts will be dancing all the way, said Brendan Fay, a leader of the group, the Lavender and Green Alliance, which will participate in the parade on March 17.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, had boycotted the event during his first two years in office because of the organizers stance toward gay and lesbian groups. At a news conference at the Irish Consulate, the mayor said he would start out in the parade marching with members of New York Citys uniformed services and would later accompany the Lavender and Green Alliance.For the last two decades theres been a blemish on this city, Mr. de Blasio, wearing a green necktie, said of the long ban on gay and lesbian groups taking part. It was a long, long road, but its something we can now put behind us because unity has been achieved.After years of resisting calls to allow gay groups, parade organizers permitted a small group of gay employees of NBC, the network that televises the parade each year, to march in 2015. But Mr. de Blasio still chose to skip the parade, saying that the move did not go far enough and that he would not participate as long as there were continued restrictions on other groups.Then in September, parade organizers announced that Lavender and Green, which had worked for years to open up the event, would take part. The decision came after the parades longtime board chairman was pushed aside.On Thursday, activists and organizers said a range of gay groups had decided to march together in the parade under the Lavender and Green banner. It was not clear whether additional groups would be allowed to take part next year.I think we should just get past this year, Frank McGreal, a member of the parades board of directors, said.City Councilman Daniel Dromm choked up and was briefly unable to continue speaking about the change.There were many times when we wanted to give up and we wondered if we would ever see this day, Mr. Dromm said, holding a small Irish flag and a small rainbow flag representing gay pride. Acknowledging the small step forward taken last year, he said, This was always about including an Irish gay group in the parade, and thats what finally has happened.Mr. Dromm, a Queens Democrat, said that of the four members of the City Councils Irish-American caucus, three are gay. One of his fellow caucus members, Jimmy Van Bramer, also a Democrat from Queens, recalled a real profound and deep feeling of exclusion and powerlessness at being barred from the parade for the last 25 years.He said that he had been arrested protesting the exclusion of gay men from the parade and recalled standing on the sidelines of the parade in the past chanting Let us in! Let us in!For 25 years we protested, Mr. Van Bramer said. For all of these years Ive had to say, No, Im not going to the parade, I cant go to the parade and its a very, very painful thing. He said that he would march this year and added, Having watched the parade for 25 years, it looks like a lot of fun.The controversy over the parade dates to 1990, when the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization asked for permission to march and was turned down.The next year, Mayor David N. Dinkins promoted a compromise in which members of a gay and lesbian group marched as part of another delegation that was permitted to be in the parade. But they were jeered, and beer cans were thrown at them and Mr. Dinkins.Organizers subsequently barred gay and lesbian groups from taking part in the parade, a ban that continued until last year. Mr. Dinkins skipped the parade during his last two years as mayor, but Mayors Rudolph W. Giuliani and Michael R. Bloomberg both regularly marched in the parade.Mr. de Blasio resumed the boycott when he entered office in 2014."}
{"text": "The New York Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist, 34, joined the team for the 2005-6 season at age 23. Back then, the native of Are, Sweden, was teased for his skinny jeans, skinny ties and European flair. He stuck with his look and is now known as perhaps the most stylish guy in the National Hockey League.1 Jacket Ive been wearing this navy blue wool coat with a fur collar from Ferragamo. I got it from the Ferragamo store in New York City almost a year ago. I like the way it fits, which is slim, and its a little fun with the collar. You can also take off the collar, and then you get a different look. It works well with jeans and also with suits.2 Suit We have to wear suits when we travel and go to games, so four to five days a week, youre in a suit. I remember my first couple of years in the league, there were a lot of comments about how I dressed, because I guess it was more European. I was wearing skinny ties  this was 11 years ago  and they were not used to that. But then two years later, skinny ties started to pick up in the U.S., especially in New York. But Ive found it doesnt really matter what people say. If you feel comfortable, stick with it. The last couple of years, Ive been starting to wear more and more double-breasted styles. Its kind of a little bit more old-school. I like one by this Swedish brand Stephen F.3 Shoes Ferragamo makes the best shoes. My favorite is probably a pair of black velvet ones, although I dont wear them all the time.4 Watch I picked up a new TAG Heuer watch a few months ago. Its in rose gold, and Ive been wearing that the most lately. When it comes to clothes, I wear a lot of blue, black and gray, and also, of course, white shirts. The watch has a gray face and gray band, but then it looks really good with the rose gold. The contrast is what made it stand out. But its still a very clean look, which is what I like.5 Jeans If Im not in suits, Ill wear jeans, boots and a leather jacket. I love music and I like a little bit of that rock n roll look. I wear a lot of black jeans. My favorites are by Tiger of Sweden. Theyre skinny but not too tight. Again, that was something I got a lot of comments on in the early days, but its pretty common here now. And now the younger guys in the league dress better and care more about clothes. But even if someone teases you, just laugh it off. Have fun with it."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits unexpectedly rose last week, the Labor Department said on Thursday, but the underlying trend continued to point to a strengthening labor market.The labor markets resilience was reinforced by another report on Thursday showing that announced layoffs by United States companies tumbled 18 percent in February. The signs of sustained labor market strength were the latest indication the economy is regaining momentum after slowing in the fourth quarter.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 278,000 for the week ended Feb. 27, the Labor Department said. Claims have been below the 300,000 threshold, which is associated with healthy labor market conditions, for a year. That is the longest period since the early 1970s.The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 1,750 to 270,250 last week, the lowest level since late November.In a separate report, the global outplacement consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said that companies based in the United States announced 61,599 job cuts last month, down from 75,114 in January. It said layoffs remained concentrated in the troubled energy industry, which has been hit by a slump in crude oil prices, where employers announced 25,051 job cuts in February.But the firmer labor market picture was dimmed by a third report showing that employment in the vast services sector contracted in February, for the first time in two years.The Institute for Supply Management said its index of services industries employment fell 2.4 points to a reading of 49.7 for February. That contributed to the institutes nonmanufacturing index dipping 0.1 point to a reading of 53.4 last month.The claims data has no bearing on the employment report for February, to be released by the government on Friday, as it falls outside the survey period. But it is the latest indication that the labor market remains on solid footing despite a recent tightening in financial market conditions. A report on Wednesday showed strong private sector hiring last month, suggesting a pickup in overall job growth.In a fourth report on Thursday, the Commerce Department said new orders for manufactured goods rebounded 1.6 percent, after dropping 2.9 percent in December. That was the largest increase since June, and it came after two consecutive months of declines.The increase in factory orders was the latest suggestion that the worst of the factory slump was most likely over. Factory activity, which accounts for about 12 percent of the economy, has been hurt by a strong dollar and weak global demand, which have undercut exports. Spending cuts by energy companies in the wake of a plunge in oil prices are also a drag, as are efforts by businesses to reduce an inventory glut.In another report, the Labor Department said nonfarm productivity fell at a 2.2 percent rate in the fourth quarter and not the 3 percent pace it reported last month. Still, labor-related costs increased solidly as companies employed more workers to raise output.While weak productivity has bolstered employment growth as companies hire more workers to increase output, sustained weakness could undermine Americans living standards. Soft productivity has significantly lowered the economys long-run potential.Growth in unit labor costs, the price of labor per single unit of output, was revised down to a 3.3 percent rate from a 4.5 percent pace."}
{"text": "GREENBURGH, N.Y.   The shelf life of Carmelo Anthonys brief interaction with a heckler during the Knicks loss Tuesday night to the Portland Trail Blazers has proved to be amazingly long. On Wednesday, the team issued a statement on Anthonys behalf in which he expressed regret for his actions. On Thursday, Anthony apologized for nothing.I dont think I said anything wrong, Anthony said.Anthony said the statement issued by the team had been a directive from James L. Dolan, the Knicks owner.It was Mr. Dolans decision, Anthony said.Give the stumbling Knicks some credit: They are not dull. Their most recent stretch of dysfunction seems to be reaching a fever pitch ahead of their game Friday against the Celtics in Boston.Anthony said the only solution was to start winning some games, which sounded reasonable enough  except that the Knicks (25-37) are not very good at winning games.I know that the entire organization  players, coaching staff, management, owner  nobody likes losing, said Kurt Rambis, the teams interim coach. So we all have to get better in order to right this ship, and we all have to handle the situation in the best way possible.The ship has been taking on water in recent days, and Rambis had the weary look of a stowaway. Not so long ago, Rambis was talking about pushing the Knicks toward a playoff berth. Now, all those hopes and dreams have devolved into breathless deconstructions of courtside exchanges with fans and team-issued apologies  or nonapologies, as the case may be.On Tuesday, late in the Knicks 104-85 loss to the Trail Blazers at Madison Square Garden, a fan sitting behind the home bench began to yell at Anthony. Dolan was sitting nearby in his customary spot along the baseline, and Anthony told the fan that he should ask Dolan for a refund  an episode that Anthony shared with reporters after the game.On Wednesday afternoon, the Knicks disseminated a public apology from Anthony through one of their Twitter accounts.We are all frustrated by the teams recent results  everyone, including me, my teammates, coaches and the fans, the statement read. Last night, a fan and I let those frustrations get the best of us. I should not have responded the way I did.On Thursday, Anthony was asked about the origins of the statement: Whose idea was it?The Knicks, he said, before placing responsibility for the final call on Dolan. It was a collaborative effort, though. We sat down and we talked about it. Everybody thought it would be a good idea to send out an apology.Yet when he was pressed for additional details on his conversation with the fan, Anthony made it clear that he was not exactly full of remorse.I really dont want to keep harping on the same thing, but I dont really think I said anything wrong, Anthony said.He added: The guy said he wasnt coming to any more games. I said: Why are you talking to me about it? The owners right there. You should discuss that with him. Dont yell my name out and talk to me about that. Talk to the owner about that. There wasnt no hostility. He said what he had to say, and I said what I had to say.Without getting into specifics, Rambis said he generally frowned on players getting into exchanges with fans.I think that players that have been in this league for any length of time know that thats something that you just dont do, Rambis said.Anthony, 31, is in the second year of a five-year deal worth $124 million, and his frustration has been mounting with the Knicks losses  15 in their last 18 games. But rarely in his career has Anthony been so public about his feelings, and perhaps some of the bonds between himself and the franchise are fraying.He is, above all, sick of losing.It tests you, he said. It tests your positivity. It tests you emotionally, psychologically.At the same time, Anthony said he would continue to do what he could to help lift the team out of its funk. He said it was his duty.At the end of the day, it falls on me, he said. I accept that.REBOUNDSThe Knicks declined to renew the 10-day contract of Jimmer Fredette, leaving the team with an open roster spot. Fredette wound up playing five minutes in two appearances, scoring 7 points. Kurt Rambis said Fredette had done everything the Knicks had asked of him in practice. But Rambis was unable to find a role for him. He didnt do things that would have pushed someone else out of the rotation, Rambis said."}
{"text": "Updated, 10:45 a.m.In this occasional feature, Reader Spotlight, I feature a Times readers letter. This one, from Gerald LeRoy, comes with a graphic element  a screen shot of the top of Thursdays home page with a few instructive numerals added every time a certain candidates name is mentioned. (See the image just below Mr. LeRoys quoted words.)He writes:I wish I was a journalist. Someone who is a much better writer than I am could do a better job of succinctly describing how the only (as in only) thing this guy is interested in is promoting his brand/name. Thats it. Period. If we want him to go away, as reasonable people do  why help him promote his brand? Cant we treat him *and his name* like Voldemort and not say it? Example: his name appears ELEVEN times  above the fold digitally  on the cover of todays NY Times. Actually I probably missed some  maybe there are more occurrences  probably subliminal ones as well. Its like trying to find all of the hidden objects in Highlights magazine in the doctors office when I was a kid. And he didnt even have to pay The Times to advertise for him. That part is genius.Mr. LeRoy is not the only person to notice this phenomenon. On Twitter, a Times tech writer, Mike Isaac, made a similar observation in graphic form, but he used Wednesdays home page instead of Thursdays.Update: As I was quickly reminded Friday morning on Twitter by two of The Timess political reporters, it is important to note the context here.@Sulliview GOP is basically imploding. Its kind of a big, historic story, no? Michael Barbaro (@mikiebarb) 4 Mar 16@Sulliview Feels like after a candidate wins 10 states its worth reporting on Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) 4 Mar 16They make good points. Mr. Trumps ascendency, disruption of the Republican party (and its response) is a huge political story, and, of course, deserves plenty of coverage.In an email, Mr. Barbaro noted that Thursday was a historic day in the life of the GOP (which is, after all, the party of Lincoln, and Teddy Roosevelt and Reagan). He suggested a thought experiment: If Bill Clinton and Barack Obama denounced Hillary Clinton as unfit for the presidency (which is the equivalent news story on the D side), dont we agree there would likely be 11 mentions of it on the home page, or more?And he added: Thats how staggeringly big this news is, after all! These are earthquakes. Indeed, the news value is significant. And, in many cases, the coverage has been tough-minded, not laudatory.Separately, Politicos Jack Shafer wrote earlier this week that the medias role in creating Mr. Trumps success has been vastly overstated.Nevertheless, I think Mr. LeRoys larger point about the extent of media attention for Mr. Trump  day after day for many weeks  remains well worth keeping in mind."}
{"text": "In the last week of January, Ben Whishaw, the waifish and intense star of London Spy and the 2008 remake of Brideshead Revisited, arrived in New York from London for a six-month stay. Installed in the West Village, for weeks Mr. Whishaw has walked across Manhattan to a work space in the East Village, and for five hours a day rehearsed for his Broadway debut.Mr. Whishaw, 35, is here for the Broadway revival of The Crucible, now in previews. He stars opposite the Oscar nominees Saoirse Ronan and Sophie Okonedo as John Proctor, the upright but errant linchpin of the play, who faces down, rather than buckles under, the accusations of witchcraft that roiled Salem, Mass., in 1692.Despite being steeped in Arthur Millers grim, hysterical Puritan world, Mr. Whishaw recently tumbled into an East Village seafood restaurant merry and full of praise for New York.I love it here, he said, settling into a corner table and ordering a glass of Chianti. Its a clich, but it is true, and its quite stark when you come from somewhere else: Its the positivity and optimism of this place. You wont notice it, because youre around it all the time, but its very up, compared to England.He may naturally incline toward the English national character, he admitted with a giggle, but New York agrees with him. Here he, too, is up.Despite a career that has taken him to tiny theaters and megabudget Bond films alike, he remains something of a cipher, a chameleon able to walk the streets of New York unrecognized and unbothered.Hes not an actor who pushes himself into the front, said Ivo van Hove, the director of The Crucible. Actually, the opposite is true. I have to push him to the front.Mr. Whishaw grew up in Langford, England, a pretty unremarkable village in Bedfordshire an hour and a half north of London, with a twin brother and parents unconnected to the theater.They were always incredibly supportive of me wanting to do acting, he said, and never put it in my head that there has to be a more sensible option to fall back on.And so there never was. So far, there has been no need of one. Mr. Whishaw found success early, playing Hamlet in Trevor Nunns 2004 production just after graduating from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and has worked continually ever since.He is one of the most celebrated stage actors of his generation and has turned up in a wide range of film and TV roles. He is the latest Q in the 007 films, a precocious, baby-genius variation on the usual theme; he is Richard II in a televised adaptation of Shakespeares history plays, a performance that won him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award in 2013; he is, whether you realize it or not, the voice of Paddington Bear. (Endearing, The New Yorker said.)His calling card is a soulful fragility, all faunlike bearing and saucer eyes, with a teenagers unruly mop mane. It is no accident that fashion has made him a favorite, and in 2013, he appeared in an ad campaign for Prada.Many of his roles play up this quality: the doomed, lovelorn John Keats of Jane Campions biopic Bright Star; the preening, brittle Sebastian Flyte of Brideshead Revisited; and, more recently, the bereaved malcontent searching for answers after his lovers murder in the critically lauded BBC mini-series London Spy.The bushy beard that his part in The Crucible requires does little to dispel the tender aura he projects. John Proctor is typically played as a virtuous brute, a brawny mans man of 17th century New England. (In the 2002 revival, the role went to the hulking Liam Neeson.)Mr. van Hove said he thought that Mr. Whishaw could bring Proctors traditional robustness to the part but that his fragility, his vulnerability is equally important. I think thats what makes Ben into a great actor, he said, to reinvent this part for our timesBut Proctor, it is fair to say, is a departure, a headlong dive against type, and one undertaken with some trepidation.I have a lot of fear, Mr. Whishaw said. All the time. But its important somehow to have fear and then to overcome it. I feel a bit like Im always on an edge, where the fear might completely overwhelm me and I might not be able to do it. Thats not happened yet.As an actor, Mr. Whishaw rejects the idea of type altogether, which may in part account for the range of his rsum. He has a slippery way of inhabiting heroes and antiheroes alike, of seducing women and men onscreen and onstage with equal ease.He is, in fact, one of the few openly gay actors to frequently play straight romance. He officially came out in 2013, to little controversy or fanfare, and confirmed his relationship with his partner, Mark Bradshaw, an Australian composer.Ive never been anything other than myself, Mr. Whishaw said, though earlier in his career he was vague about his sexuality and deflected questions about it, leading to occasional uncertainty in the press.While promoting a play, The Pride, in which he and Hugh Dancy played lovers, Mr. Whishaw gave interviews to New York Magazine and to Out  one of which assumed that he was straight, the other, gay. (The Village Voice gleefully pointed out the inconsistency.)We must be watching gay actors play straight people all the time, he said, but we just dont know about it, mustnt we? Its not even an issue. It doesnt matter.He is equally uninterested in dissecting his acting approach or his methods. When I was doing London Spy, Jim Broadbent, who I adore, said, You must never talk about acting, Mr. Whishaw said.And on the whole, he does not. He called himself an instinctive actor. But he is staunch in his conviction that his work is not an expression of, nor is it limited to, his own experience.If I could only act the things Ive experienced, then Id be a very limited actor, he said. Its a preposterous idea that thats all that an actor can do. Im not really like any of the characters that Ive played. I dont feel like theyre me. Anythings possible. You can understand anybody, really, or try to.At the moment, he is working to understand John Proctor, in all his tortured uncertainties, as well as America, his temporary home, in all of its own.Its really hard for me  for us, he said. (Given the plays long run, Mr. Bradshaw also moved with him to the West Village.) It has its own set of ideas about stuff.He was full of questions about Donald J. Trump, the electoral system and Americas fraught relationship to gun ownership. (The Crucible, period piece though it is, has, in its evil-in-our-midst persecutions, plenty of application to the American present. We see it every day around us, Mr. van Hove said.)Mr. Whishaw has barely had time to be homesick. He has been lax, he said, about staying in touch with those in Britain, though he tunes in to BBC Radio, and over the course of a photo shoot on a frigid Sunday morning politely requested a builders tea: English slang for tea, of no particularly elevated type, served strong, sweet and milky. (He gratefully accepted a cup of PG tips, Englands unfussy mainstay.)Back at the seafood restaurant in the declining light of the afternoon  he had just finished with rehearsal, which Mr. van Hove holds religiously from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., no later  Mr. Whishaw finished off his Chianti, then his companions, and waxed thoughtful about his life as an actor.Id probably do it if I had to go and do it above a pub, he said.He probably will not have to.Im a bit in awe of how brilliant he is, I really am, said Ms. Ronan, his co-star, who plays Abigail Williams, John Proctors former mistress and the ringleader of the accusers. That doesnt happen to me very often."}
{"text": "MILWAUKEE   President Obama said on Thursday that enrollment in health coverage under the Affordable Care Act had reached a new high, 20 million, and he called the law an overwhelming success in this city and around the nation despite Republicans implacable opposition.Congressional Republicans have tried and failed to repeal Obamacare about 60 times, Mr. Obama said to an audience here. They have told you what they would replace it with about zero times.He continued, his voice rising: If they got their way, 20 million people would have their insurance taken away from them. Twenty million people!The 20 million figure includes people who have received private health insurance on exchanges, those who gained Medicaid coverage under state expansions and young adults who were able to stay on their parents health plans until age 26, the administration said.In its last comparable estimate, in September, the administration said 17.6 million uninsured people had gained coverage.Mr. Obamas trip was intended to reward Milwaukee, which won a nationwide competition called Healthy Communities by enrolling an estimated 38,376 people in private health insurance under the health care law. That was about 75 percent of previously uninsured residents who were eligible, a rate higher than that of any other city.The law has been particularly successful in places like Milwaukee, where a coalition of local leaders, charities and health care companies have worked to sign up those who did not have health insurance.Average insurance premiums in the city fell 2.1 percent for 2016 plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Its an example of what community outreach can do even in the face of a governor who is not supportive of the A.C.A., said Drew Altman, the president and chief executive of the foundation, which focuses on health issues.Wisconsins Republican governor, Scott Walker, who has disparaged the health law, expanded the states Medicaid program just short of the level that would allow the state to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in federal aid.Mr. Walker has argued that federal funding is uncertain over the long term. If anyone thinks the federal government, which is currently $18 trillion in debt, will not renege on its future funding promises, they are not living in reality, Laurel Patrick, the governors press secretary, said in an email.But no state would save more money by further expanding Medicaid than Wisconsin, according to an estimate by the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a nonprofit group.Your governor still refuses to expand Medicaid, which, by the way, actually would save money, Mr. Obama said. Hes denying Wisconsinites their ticket to health insurance, and its political.The Milwaukee county executive, Chris Abele, a Democrat, said in a speech on Thursday that city leaders were pleased to win the Health Communities contest, but that it was not the motivation for their efforts.We did it because thousands of people in this county who never had health care before do now, Mr. Abele said. We also did it because the Affordable Care Act has already saved  I wrote that in big, bold letters  saved the county over $2 million.Before Mr. Obamas address at a middle school, he stopped at a restaurant, Engine Company 3, to speak to a handful of people who had written letters to him about the law. Among them was Brent Brown, of Mosinee, Wis., a Republican who later introduced the president to a raucous crowd of about 700 at the school.To be clear, I have never voted for President Obama, he said. Ever.Mr. Brown said that the health law had saved his life after he became desperately ill.And to the Republicans who wish to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I plead with you to reconsider, Mr. Brown said. Swallow your pride  as I am doing right now in front of many Democrats  and do what is right.Mr. Obama said that as many as 129 million Americans with pre-existing conditions could no longer be charged more or denied coverage because of that prior illness, and that 140 million Americans now got free preventive care such as mammograms.So your insurance is better than it was even if you dont know it, even if you didnt vote for me. Thanks, Obama, the president said to a roar of laughter. You got an upgrade."}
{"text": "The third season of House of Cards ended practically in midsentence, with President Frank Underwood calling after his wife, Claire, as she walked out of the White House and, seemingly, away from their marriage and political partnership.The fourth season, which went live on Netflix on Friday, picks up where that charged moment left off, while also continuing to follow Underwood as he campaigns for re-election.Before settling into another binge-fest, here are a few talking points to keep in mind about some of the shows key characters.[ Read our TV recaps of House of Cards ]Claire Underwoods departure could be very damaging to her husbands re-election. Last seasons fracture in the Underwoods relationship was primarily precipitated by two things. One was Claires resignation as United Nations ambassador, which was forced upon her when Frank promised President Viktor Petrov of Russia that he would convince her to step down. Second was Claires early glimpse of Tom Yatess book-in-progress, which described the first couples marriage as one of equals, prompting Claire to realize the lack of truth in that observation.When she tried to discuss her concerns with Frank, he responded as all loving husbands do: by violently squeezing her face in his hands and telling her to start doing her job as supportive first lady or else. Cut to Claire clip-clopping her heels toward the White House front door as if shes starring in her own version to Waiting to Exhale.The Democratic candidate Heather Dunbar and the former candidate Jackie Sharp have joined forces. Last season, Dunbars attempt to blackmail Underwood using Claires journal  which contained some damaging information regarding the first ladys abortion history  blew up in her face. But even though she lost the Iowa primary, Dunbar now has Jackie Sharp in her corner. And Sharp, who was previously promised the VP spot if she dropped out of the race and endorsed Underwood, is a savvy politician as well as someone with good reason to resent Frank, who threw her under a bus during a live Democratic debate.Doug Stamper is healthy again and back to doing Underwoods evil bidding.  Doug began Season 3 in recovery mode, still suffering from major physical injuries after Rachel Posner attacked him in self-defense at the end of Season 2. Forced to stay away from the office, Doug descended back into alcoholism but eventually straightened himself out so he could enjoy his other drug of choice: engaging in dirty deeds for Frank. He did one of his dirtiest near the end of last season, when he finally killed Rachel  the former prostitute who knew a little too much about the circumstances surrounding Franks manipulation and murder of Peter Russo.Do not forget about Lucas Goodwin. Remember this journalist and former boyfriend of Zoe Barnes, whom Frank pushed off a subway platform at the beginning of Season 2? Lucass obsession with uncovering Underwoods crimes eventually led to his getting sent to jail after committing acts of cyberterrorism. Lucas was out of the picture last season and presumably still has a few years left in his sentence.Seth Grayson also should make President Underwood nervous. Before Doug negotiated his way into the chief of staff position vacated by Remy Danton, Seth, the communications chief, lobbied for the job. As a man who only weaseled his way into the presidents good graces by betraying the trust of his previous employer, Raymond Tusk, a dissatisfied Seth seems potentially dangerous."}
{"text": "Updated, 9:58 p.m. | Much has been written about the remarkable achievements of NASA astronaut Scott Kelly and his Russian counterpart, cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko, during their (340-day) Year in Space mission aboard the International Space Station.Daniel Victor hada fine overview on Tuesday and make sure to revisit Kenneth Changs fascinating package on Kelly and the long mission, in which, as he notes, Kelly and Kornienko experienced 10,880 sunrises* and sunsets in those 340 days.This post is simply a brief note of thanks to Kelly, in particular, for sharing 1,000 images of Earth shot from the space station and posted on Twitter and Instagram using the #yearinspace hashtag.You can sift the entire batch at WindowsOnEarth.org,a website featuring photography by astronauts aboardthe International Space Station. In a related contest, starting on March 7 on Facebook, you can make the case for your favorites. (The primary source for such images is NASAs Gateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth.*)Given how such imagery has become so commonplace, I found myself wondering this week whether such views of Earth have retained the ability to inspire and meaningfully engage people back on the surface with the reality that all of our triumphs and tragedies, dreams and defeatsare limited to a tiny pale blue dot, as Carl Sagan so eloquently put things two decades ago (it was this phrase that inspired the name of this blog back in 2007).Id like to hear from you on this question. I especially hope to hear from young people whove grown up with an unremarkable top-down view of the aurora borealis.Heres the answer I got fromDan Barstow, the education manager for the International Space Station National Lab, who alsocurates an online collection of space station photography*:Ive been involved in Earth and space science education for years. And theres no question. These images continue to inspire and engage. They are masterpieces of science and art. And like mostart, their power is emotional. They engage, inspire and most importantly, help us see the Earth as a whole planet.Ive reviewed hundreds of thousands of images, and shared them through the web, through public presentations, in art galleries, and in educational lessons. These photos never fail to inspire wowmoments.I remember asking astronaut Karen Nyberg how her photography changed over her six months in space. She said that at first she focused on the science and planetary geography  weather events,volcanoes, retreating glaciers, the aurora, cities at night. But then she began to focus more on the sheer beauty of Earth, the artistic side. And she certainly took some wonderful evocative photos.The astronauts take hundreds of pictures every day. Many are tasked by scientists  a daily list of priority targets. But most are taken directly from the astronauts hearts and souls. Oh wow! Look atthat. Click. And that! Click.Remember, this is hand-held photography. They use Nikon D4 digital cameras with a whole range of lenses. And just like anyone traveling, the camera helps them engage with the views and sharethem with the world.And that is the real power of these photos. They go right from the astronauts heart to our own. They inspire something deep within all of us  a love for our home planet. The astronauts are our humaneyes in space. At just the right time in our history, when we all need to see the Earth from afar, we need to build this planetary consciousness, so we can become the shepherds this great planet requires.I need to ask this question because I feel deeply biased by my upbringing. Those of us who came of age during the space race are increasingly outliers.Through much of our time, each mission seemed to reveal marvelous new views of the home planet. Pivotal, of course, was the chance Apollo 8 photograph in 1968 that came to be known as Earthrise:(Dont miss the great narrated NASA video on the making of that photo, narrated by the Apollo historian Andrew Chaikin.)I recently got to talk about that moment on StarTalk TV with Neil deGrasse Tyson (and his comedian sidekick Maeve Higgins).Since then, wonders have never ceased. Consider Cassinis views of Earth from beyond the rings of Saturn.Late last year, the era of nonstop blue marbles began, and this new Earthrise view, as well:So, let me know what you think, and  more important  how you feel, when you get a chance to look at yourself through the eyes, heart and lens of a space-faring hero.Postscripts| * I forgot to include a link to the official NASA imagery portal in the initial post. On Twitter, Peter Caltner noted that the mission saw 10,880 sunrises and sunsets, not 10,994, as I originally wrote (which would have been the case if the mission had not been shortened to 340 days)."}

{"text": "Gov. Chris Christie pretty much gave up on New Jersey when he decided to run for president. Little wonder that New Jersey has given up on him.Mr. Christies popularity is at rock bottom: Only 30 percent of registered voters approve of his performance, according to a poll this week by Fairleigh Dickinson University. Sixty-one percent disapprove. Fifty-nine percent think New Jersey is headed off the rails, the poll found, the highest number of despondent respondents since Mr. Christie took office in 2010.On Tuesday, six New Jersey newspapers owned by the Gannett chain jointly urged Mr. Christie to resign. Another paper, The Star-Ledger of Newark, joined them on Thursday. It accused Mr. Christie of abandoning his duties, of letting crises fester while campaigning out of state: He was gone 72 percent of the days in 2015, and even more often during the start of this year. In any other job, he would have been fired long ago. The editorial also called the governor out as a fraud  someone who had lied over and over, who had forfeited the last shreds of his credibility by endorsing someone he had only recently ferociously belittled: Donald Trump.The editorial used the words disastrous, infuriating, craven, phony, hypocrisy and opportunism to describe the chief executive in his second term. Voters share the disgust. According to the Fairleigh Dickinson poll, the most common one-word description for the governor was bully. (The second was arrogant.)Its hard for a non-New Jersey newspaper to know what to say. This is like gazing upon a bleak marriage, where Mr. Christie is the obsessed spouse chasing a destructive love interest (the White House, the national stage, his own reflection, Mr. Trump). The Times editorial page has already noted Mr. Christies infidelity to New Jersey voters, but having told him to go home to Trenton, its awkward now to say: Get out of Trenton.Not that he would listen. Mr. Christie sings only to and of himself; the stage he inhabits has only one spotlight, his own.Except when Mr. Trump seizes it. Standing silently behind his new friend at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday night, Mr. Christie looked stricken. By what? Conscience? Regret? The melancholy words of a Simon and Garfunkel song?What I was thinking was, wow, were going to win seven states tonight, Mr. Christie explained on Thursday. But leave it to him to turn that we back to the first person: You never look good standing behind someone, he said. I wanted to have the people standing behind me. Because you always look better! It didnt work out.No, it didnt. And in New Jersey today, its not working out for retirees, whom he had once promised to protect from pension cuts. Or for Atlantic City, which is on the brink of bankruptcy. In his Super Tuesday reverie, Mr. Christie could have been thinking about the states fiscal crisis, or a transit strike that could soon strand thousands of commuters. But his mind was far away, with his body in Palm Beach.As satisfying as it would be to join the chorus calling for Mr. Christie to quit, perhaps it is better to let him keep his latest promise. Im going to do my job, he told the press. He said it on Thursday, March 3, 2016. Mark his words. For whatever they are worth."}
{"text": "A few years ago, Osmo Vanska and his Minnesota Orchestra experienced a bitter inversion of the old maxim. How do you not get to Carnegie Hall? Lockout, lockout, lockout.A standoff between the ensembles musicians and its management caused the cancellation of its 2012-13 season and much of 2013-14. That latter season was to have been the occasion for a rare Carnegie showcase for an American orchestra: four concerts devoted to Sibelius, Mr. Vanskas specialty. Including all seven of the composers symphonies, this series was one of the lockouts most crushing losses; indeed, when the first of the planned programs was officially called off, Mr. Vanska resigned.With the signing of a new contract, the music finally returned in 2014, and soon after Mr. Vanska did, too. On Thursday, orchestra and maestro made it to Carnegie  just two and a half years late  with their beloved Sibelius. It was a symbolic victory, and also an artistic one: The concert was urgent, authoritative.Mr. Vanskas way with this composer has what Rimbaud once called burning patience. The final movement of the Third Symphony charts the journey of a C-major chord as it builds, swirling, in intensity and grandeur. But the Minnesotans didnt just get bigger and bigger. With them, the music ebbed and flowed, coming on disconcertingly strong at the start, then receding; increasing, then dissolving, as momentum grew. The coppery burr of muted brasses emerged from the back of the orchestra, as if from a great distance, before a frightening descent into Expressionist madness.The hymn that arrives in the wake of that explosion was less forceful here than humble, aware of its own fragility. Emphasizing the low strings, darkness was always visible as the fanfares of the ending tried, and tried again, to constitute themselves. Mr. Vanska never forgot the unsteadiness Sibelius puts at the heart of these scores, sometimes rhythmic (a melody seeming to drag behind at the start of the Third Symphony, resisting an onward pull) and sometimes textural (as in the first movement of the First Symphony, when a timpani rumble, threatening a quiet clarinet melody, makes the transition to a soft string tremble).In the Violin Concerto, Hilary Hahns lean, focused sound was a perfect fit for this orchestra and this repertory, poised between rawness and refinement. In the third movement, Mr. Vanska  specific in his gestures but never rigid  led a dance by turns rustic and ghostly. The ensemble played throughout in a white heat  with richness but without fat.Offering no fewer than three encores  heartfelt, elegant Sibelius pieces  the musicians seemed reluctant to leave the stage, perhaps because they didnt know when they would return. A Carnegie spokeswoman had written earlier in the day to say that there were no plans to complete the originally scheduled cycle. But for the sake of New Yorks music lovers  and the sake of Sibelius  the hall should invite this orchestra back, and soon."}
{"text": "HONG KONG  The annual session of Chinas legislature, the National Peoples Congress, is a carefully crafted pageant intended to convey the image of a transparent, responsive government. While the congress is often dismissed as a rubber stamp, it can provide important clues to the governments priorities.Heres what you need to know about the session, which opens in Beijing on Saturday.Q. Does the congress have any real power?A. Yes, but not much. Its nearly 3,000 delegates are mostly officials and party members who dare not challenge the leadership. Ultimate political authority rests with the Chinese Communist Party, whose Politburo Standing Committee, headed by President Xi Jinping, sets policy. So the N.P.C.s influence is limited.Still, it has forced delays and the reconsideration of proposals. In Chinas authoritarian system, even small numbers of dissenting votes make a statement, such as when a third of the delegates voted against or abstained from approving the controversial Three Gorges Dam in 1992. The dam was still approved, though.Q. So what should you watch for?A. While the meetings are carefully scripted, they can be useful for discerning political priorities and economic expectations. Officials have used past meetings to send signals on important policy moves, like the end of the one-child policy.China usually announces its military budget here. It is just one total figure, so it doesnt say much, but the annual increase is analyzed for clues about the increasing capabilities of the armed forces. This year the military budget will grow by 7 to 8 percent, a congressional spokeswoman said Friday, a smaller increase than usual.The meetings also give journalists rare access to officials, both in organized news conferences and in impromptu stand-ups. Occasionally an unscripted comment shakes loose.N.P.C. delegates can also make proposals. Even if their ideas do not become legislation, they can provide a sense of which issues are of concern to the public, and within specific industries and regions.Q. What will happen this year?A. N.P.C. delegates are expected to complete Chinas 13th five-year plan, which spells out key social and economic goals from 2016 to 2020. The outlines of the plan were released after a meeting of the Communist Partys Central Committee in October. The plan is likely to be released publicly only after the congress ends, on March 16.With growth slowing, Chinas economic plans are falling under intense global scrutiny. Mr. Xi faces questions about his ability to shift the economy from its reliance on investment and exports to a more slow-growth, domestic-consumption-based model, while reducing threats of overcapacity and growing debt.On Saturday, Premier Li Keqiang will produce his annual work report, which should give a target for how much the Chinese economy will grow over the next year. While economists have questioned the accuracy of Chinas official economic statistics, the numbers are expected to give a sense of how dramatically officials expect growth to decelerate.At the end of the session, the premiers closing news conference sometimes reveals insights into the leaderships thinking.Q. How much debate is there?A. Dont expect Washington-style argument. Important decisions, like the five-year plan, are ironed out months and years in advance.In recent days the Chinese news media has run articles discussing the importance of dissenting views from political advisers. While the Communist Party can be brutal in suppressing organized political dissent, the delegates can use their reports and suggestions to highlight areas of concern.Another body, the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference, meets at the same time. With a membership including people in business, the arts, law and other fields, it is intended to offer a broader range of suggestions on the direction of the country, but it has no lawmaking power."}
{"text": "Jason Servis watched with pride when John, his brother and fellow thoroughbred trainer, sent Smarty Jones to victories in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes in 2004. But his joy turned to sadness when the long-shot Birdstone upset Smarty Joness Triple Crown bid by one length in the Belmont Stakes. Sadness turned to dismay when the colt never ran again.Smarty Jones was retired less than two months after his lone defeat closed a brilliant but fleeting nine-race career. The colt was said to have chronic bruising of the bottom of the cannon bone in all four fetlock joints.That wrenching swing of emotions stays with Jason Servis as he prepares to run Sunny Ridge on Saturday at Aqueduct Racetrack in the Gotham Stakes, a significant Kentucky Derby prep race on the New York circuit. Sunny Ridge prevailed by three-quarters of a length in the Withers Stakes, the previous prep at Aqueduct. He ranks eighth with 18 points in the system used by Churchill Downs to determine a Derby field capped at 20 starters.Yet Sunny Ridges greatest obstacle to reaching the crowded Derby starting gate on May 7 may be Servis and Dennis Drazin, his breeder and owner. Although they emphasize that their plan can change, their uncommon strategy calls for them to skip the Derby in order to target the Preakness, the middle leg of the Triple Crown, and the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park in Oceanport, N.J., on July 31.I know from my experience, Servis said, if I am not careful, I wont have a horse left.Drazin is a lawyer who has a long association with racings uphill battle in his home state of New Jersey. He supports Serviss desire to take a long view with a horse that is without breeding value because he is a gelded New Jersey-bred. If I had Derby fever, Drazin said, it would be only for my ego and not looking at the right thing to do.Sunny Ridge, sired by the 1994 Horse of the Year, Holy Bull, gained prominence when he won the Sapling Stakes by two and a quarter lengths at Monmouth in September. He stamped himself as a Derby prospect with strong efforts over wet surfaces when he placed second to Greenpointcrusader in the Grade I Champagne Stakes in October at Belmont Park and missed overtaking the well regarded Exaggerator by a neck in the Delta Downs Jackpot on Nov. 21 in Vinton, La.Sunny Ridge produced a polished effort on a fast track at Aqueduct when the gray-roan gelding made his 3-year-old debut in the Withers and easily dispatched Vorticity by three-quarters of a length for jockey Manuel Franco. As impressive as that performance was, Servis and Drazin are keenly aware of the undefeated 3-year-olds Nyquist and Mohaymen.I dont know if hes Nyquist, Servis said of Sunny Ridge. I dont know if hes that type.Nyquist, winner of the Breeders Cup Juvenile and the 2-year-old champion, extended his record to 6 for 6 when he fended off Exaggerator by one and a half lengths in the Grade II San Vicente Stakes at Santa Anita Park on Feb. 15 in the first of two scheduled Derby preps for the West Coast star. Mohaymen, rated the top 3-year-old in the East, swept Floridas first two preps with rousing victories in the Holy Bull Stakes and the Fountain of Youth Stakes to make him 5 for 5.For many owners and breeders, the Derby dream is limited to having a horse good enough to start in the signature race on the first Saturday in May. Not Drazin.The average person on the street seems to judge you by Did you have a horse run in the Derby? Thats important to everybody else, but its not that important to me, Drazin said. I dont want to put a horse in the Derby who I dont think will win it, even though he could probably hit the board.Drazin, who was born in Rumson, N.J., is a former chairman of the New Jersey Racing Commission. He is a top adviser to the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemens Association, which leases Monmouth Park.Servis, 59, worked as an exercise rider before he became a trainer in 2001. He gained much of his knowledge from being on the backs of sore horses and has built a reputation for turning around problematic thoroughbreds. He sent Tightend Touchdown, a horse he claimed for $35,000, to a runner-up finish in the 2013 Breeders Cup Turf Sprint, his most significant result.He believes a key to success is his willingness to provide his horses with ample time between starts, a philosophy counter to the Triple Crowns grind of three races in five weeks.Speaking about his brother, John Servis said: Hes all about the horse, and he thinks longevity-wise. If he can have a super horse for the next few years, the Derby is not going to be on his bucket list."}
{"text": "State Street Global Advisors will introduce its 159th exchange-traded fund on Tuesday, the SPDR Gender Diversity Index E.T.F. Fortunately, the funds ticker symbol is catchier: SHE.The funds goal is to achieve market-rate returns by investing in United States companies that are leaders in advancing women through gender diversity on their boards of directors and in management. It will track an index of 125 to 150 stocks that have been culled from the Russell 1000 index and have scored high on a scale of gender metrics.Its looking to create a way for investors to put money into companies that have figured out the diversity challenge  that have managed to recruit and retain women in senior leadership positions, said Kristi Mitchem, head of the Americas institutional client group at State Street. We believe that signal has excess return.The new fund is part of a wave of so-called impact investments  those made in companies, organizations and funds with the intention of generating a measurable, beneficial social and environmental impact. SHE is built on research from the McKinsey Global Institute; Catalyst, a nonprofit group focused on womens inclusion; and others that have shown the positive impact women have, or could have, on companies when they are in senior leadership.What remains to be seen is how impact investors and the investing community more generally will receive the new E.T.F. This is not the first attempt to use an E.T.F. to invest in companies that appear to be better than their peers in promoting women to their senior ranks.Barclays started an exchange-traded note in 2014 called the Women in Leadership E.T.N. It is relatively small, with about $27.6 million invested in it. The note tracks the Barclays Women in Leadership Total Return Index, which comprises American companies with a female chief executive or board made up of at least 25 percent women, or both.And Denver Investments created the Workplace Equality Portfolio E.T.F., also in 2014. It has less than $10 million in assets and a comparatively high fee, in the E.T.F. world, of three-quarters of a percent.Neither has substantial assets nor has had a stellar performance.The SHE E.T.F., on the other hand, is getting a lift from the California State Teachers Retirement System, which is putting in $250 million and will increase that to $500 million in the coming months, said Christopher J. Ailman, chief investment officer of the pension fund.We thought this was a very smart play, Mr. Ailman said. Were going to put some money behind it and see what happens.Mr. Ailman also worked with Ms. Mitchem and her team to develop the parameters of the E.T.F. Our board has had a mandate for me  and the investments for the states teachers all the way back to 2003  to change the face of Wall Street, he said. That started with diversity, which weve made a big push on, but also gender diversity.Ms. Mitchem said her goal was to get assets to $1.5 billion to $2 billion in the first year. That could be a lofty goal, even with the push from Californias teachers.Morgan Stanley Capital International has 11 environmental, social and governance indexes, including popular low-carbon and sustainability indexes. But it reported in September that it has a total of $1.8 billion from E.T.F.s tracking them.And there is a risk to investors if the E.T.F. does not get to a certain size quickly. Greg Lessard, founder and president of Aspen Leaf Partners, a small adviser in Golden, Colo., that invests $18 million in impact E.T.F.s and index funds, said he occasionally struggled to sell a large position in some of the thinly traded green E.T.F.s in which he invested client money.A smaller E.T.F. can be thinly traded, Mr. Lessard said. I cant just execute that trade as I normally would at my custodian. I have to call a trader and say Can you insure theres a buyer at the other side? And sometimes theyll say, Its not going to happen today, Greg. There are two bigger forces at work in State Streets introduction of SHE: the increased interest in impact investing and the seeming ease with which investors can buy and sell exchange-traded funds.Michael Lear, a vice president and portfolio manager at Athena Capital Advisors, which manages $6 billion, invests client money across a range of impact strategies, from public equities and debt to venture capital and real estate.Mr. Lear said he could see the interest in impact E.T.F.s from some investors. It makes sense in terms of supporting the ecosystem, he said. You want more and more people under the tent.But for his wealthier clients, he said, he largely avoids exchange-traded funds for an impact investment because he is worried that the very nature of an E.T.F.  which is meant to track an index that may have been created for just one E.T.F.  could be riskier than people imagine.E.T.F.s are creating new benchmarks or indices, and theres a risk inherent in that, Mr. Lear said. Theyre trying to create something new, and theyre making their best efforts, but this mechanical exercise of having an E.T.F. invest by different weightings can fail.He cited a solar E.T.F. created by Guggenheim Partners  ticker: TAN  that invested in solar companies based on market capitalization. Last year it had a large investment in a Chinese solar company before shares in the company were frozen when its value plummeted.When I sit down with clients, what I generally talk about is where can you have the most bang for your buck, he said. With fixed income, the low-hanging fruit is microlending  the return is about 3 percent, its pretty stable, theres a low risk of default and youre supporting people with loans.To have greater impact, Mr. Lear said, he advised clients to measure what the investment says it will accomplish versus what it does accomplish, as well as its risk and return.To make sure that the companies in the index tracked by the SHE E.T.F. are meeting the gender criteria, Ms. Mitchem said the index would be rebalanced annually. Companies will be included if they have the highest level of women in senior leadership in their sector  meaning the E.T.F. will also seek out the best companies in male-dominated industries like oil and gas to avoid a bias toward one sector.A company in the index that the E.T.F. tracks also has to have either a female chief executive or at least one female board member to prevent a company from appointing just a few senior women.One of the driving forces behind the SHE E.T.F. is to have an impact supporting companies with women in senior roles. But Ms. Mitchem also has a charitable component, which is a first for a State Street E.T.F. The charitable fund, called SHE Gives Back, will donate money to organizations that help limit early gender bias against girls hoping to become leaders.What SHE is really focusing on is the leadership of women once they reach corporate America, Ms. Mitchem said. But what about the women who never realize their potential? How do we get more women into areas where theyre not represented, like tech and the STEM sciences?  a reference to science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The giveback provision, while novel, does not amount to a lot of money. It is calculated as 5 percent of State Streets fee, but since one of the selling points of any exchange-traded fund is its low cost, the fee is only one-fifth of 1 percent. So on the California teachers $500 million investment, the charitable donation from SHE would be $50,000.Still, like most things with impact investments, these are early days. For the true impact to be felt, it will take years and, in this case, a lot more in assets invested."}
{"text": "BRANFORD, Conn.  It may be dwarfed by Denali, the 20,308-foot peak in Alaska long known as Mount McKinley. But the mussel-covered pile of rocks about a mile off shore from this briny town on the Long Island Sound is at the center of a naming debate of its own, one fueled by what many consider the ugliness of the label it carries: Negro Heads.The rock formation and the red buoy that mark it appear by that name on Google Maps and nautical charts. Now, State Senator Ted Kennedy Jr. wants a new name for the local landmark and buoy, which he has often sailed past since moving to Branford 20 years ago.Its anachronistic, said Mr. Kennedy, a Democrat whose father was the longtime United States senator from Massachusetts. And I think for many people, its offensive.Mr. Kennedy said he had been inspired to seek the name change after President Obama announced in August that Mount McKinley, the tallest mountain in North America, would now be known as Denali, a Native Alaskan appellation meaning the high one or the great one that has deep cultural resonance. Alaskans had sought the change since the 1970s.It never occurred to me that there may be a process for changing place names, Mr. Kennedy said. It turned out there was, and he initiated that process by contacting the Connecticut Geographic Names Authority.Mr. Kennedy then contacted school officials in Branford, a New Haven suburb, and together they decided to have an essay contest at the towns high school, deferring to a new generation to find a suitable replacement for Negro Heads.The move here comes as communities and institutions across the United States are reassessing their nomenclature, amid shifting attitudes about historical figures and heightened attention to issues of race and racial discord.At nearby Yale University, Mr. Kennedys alma mater, there is a growing movement to rename Calhoun College, one of the 12 residential colleges that help define campus life. The college is named for John C. Calhoun, a Yale valedictorian from South Carolina who was among the leading white supremacists of the 19th century and one who hailed slavery as a positive good.Here in Branford, Negro Heads was once known by an even more offensive slur given to a type of thick-shelled mussel used in button making, according to 19th-century documents. (The rocks are only occasionally visible at extreme low tide.)Margaret A. Thomas, the Connecticut state geologist, said the rock formations name had been changed to Negro Heads between the 1830s and 1880s.It was probably done to soften the earlier name and make it more socially acceptable at the time, said Ms. Thomas, who also serves as chairwoman of the Geographic Names Authority.The process for changing the name now is arduous. Names are very important, and not only from an historical perspective, Ms. Thomas said. All of these names become part of a national geographic names database and also part of the 911 emergency system. They must uniquely identify the geographic location.The school district plans to solicit essays on the topic in the next month or so. A committee whose membership broadly represents the town will be appointed soon to choose the winning name by the end of the school year. An application with the proposed name will be forwarded to the United States Board on Geographic Names, a federal body created in 1890 to maintain uniform name usage.The federal board will then send it back to Connecticuts Geographic Names Authority, which will survey Branford residents and leaders, including town officials and the local historical society, Ms. Thomas said.After that, the state naming agency will decide whether to officially recommend the new name. If it does make such a recommendation, the proposed name goes back to the federal board, which has the ultimate authority over any changes.A spokesman for the United States Coast Guard, Frank Simmons, said that a name change would not present a challenge for patrol boats near Branford Harbor, since the new name would be added to official nautical charts.Ms. Thomas said there was no guarantee that the federal board would accept a new name.Just because a name is proposed by a student and blessed by the town committee does not mean that it will be successful, she said. The name thats selected needs to be appropriate and fulfill the federal guidelines. A good name reflects the identity of the place, which includes everything from the history to the character of the people.Hamlet M. Hernandez, superintendent of the Branford public schools, said that asking students to consider new names for the rock formation was a constructive exercise because it involved historical research and the crafting of argumentative essays.Its something thats relevant because they live in the community and many students may have passed by the rocks in small dinghies, he said. I think its a very authentic writing assignment.Not everyone in Branford, where 94 percent of the 28,000 residents are white, favors changing the name.Mike Infantino, 65, a boat captain who owns the Sea Mist Thimble Island Cruise here, said the name Negro Heads  offensive or not  was part of the towns heritage. Im old school, he said. Whether they are trying to be politically correct, I dont think something that was put there hundreds of years ago should be changed.Nichola Roberts, a 28-year-old nurse who has lived in Branford for six years, disagreed. Its nice to be sensitive to other peoples feelings, so why not? she said.Mr. Kennedy said he felt strongly that local and state residents had a right to rename the landmark. The bottom of Long Island Sound is actually owned by the citizens of the state, he said, and I think most people would feel that this name is not appropriate.As for whether he had any ideas of his own for a new name, Mr. Kennedy was politic. I dont want to superimpose my particular views on the town, he said. This should be a community project and it needs to be scrupulously historic, nonpartisan and inclusive."}

{"text": "A traveling clothing salesman was sentenced on Friday to 75 years to life in prison for killing three merchants in Brooklyn in a series of attacks that had shopkeepers on alert for months, prosecutors said.The man, Salvatore Perrone, 67, of Staten Island, was convicted last month in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn of three counts of second-degree murder. Justice Alan D. Marrus sentenced Mr. Perrone to the maximum penalty allowed.In three attacks in 2012, the authorities said, Mr. Perrone went into stores in Brooklyn around closing time, when the merchants, who were all of Middle Eastern origin, were alone. He opened fire with the same sawed-off rifle in each attack. When he was arrested, he had been planning to attack again, the police said.Its hard to think of anyone who deserves to spend the rest of his life in prison more than this coldblooded and unrepentant serial killer, Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, said in a statement on Friday.During the sentencing hearing, Mr. Perrone maintained his innocence, officials said.The series of shootings began on July 6, 2012, when Mohamed Gebeli, 65, was found inside his clothing store in the Bay Ridge neighborhood with a single gunshot wound to the neck. On Aug. 2, Isaac Kadare, 59, was shot in the head and his throat was slit inside his store in Bensonhurst. And on Nov. 16, Rahmatollah Vahidipour, 78, was shot in the head, face and chest in his clothing shop in the Prospect-Lefferts Gardens neighborhood.The shootings were connected by .22-caliber shell casings recovered at the scenes."}

{"text": "In an effort to reach millions of Hispanic voters, Bernie Sanderss campaign is running a five-minute Spanish-language ad on Univision that calls attention to the plight of a female farm worker in Florida.In the ad, the woman chokes back tears two minutes into telling her story, one that began with her saying Voy a luchar mientras, or I will always fight. But the ad then drifts into the hardships she faces, like the low wages she earns working the tomato fields of Immokalee, Fla.The ad is part of a several hundred thousand dollar advertising push that will run nationally on the Univision network, as well as on local Univision-affiliated stations in Miami, Orlando, Phoenix and Tucson.The effort is a nontraditional advertising strategy: creating a mini-documentary and buying a large, expensive block of advertising time. But the Sanders team, excited about its Thursday night placement in prime time (8:48 p.m.) on the network, is expecting the ad to reach millions. It will air just days before the March 15 Democratic primary in Florida.The Sanders campaign chose Univision because of its extensive reach and relationship with the Latino community, which might be more interested in the documentary-style advertisement than watching a traditional 30-second spot. It has also produced a separate, slightly longer version to share on social media.It tells the story of a visit Mr. Sanders made to the small town in 2008, where he discovered a human tragedy, as he described it, and worked to expose the harsh conditions in the area.But rather than Mr. Sanders recalling the episode, the ad centers around one character, a young Mexican immigrant named Udelia, who tells the story of her life as a farm worker in Immokalee, an unincorporated town in southwest Florida known for its tomato fields.The ad is similar to one the Sanders campaign released featuring Erica Garner, the daughter of Eric Garner, the man killed by police officers in Staten Island in 2014. In that spot, nearly the entire story is handed over to Mrs. Garner to tell her story. Mr. Sanders only becomes a part of the ad halfway through.Udelia, who narrates in Spanish with English subtitles, speaks as a mother, detailing the difficulties and abuses she and fellow workers faced in the tomato fields, saying they were denied water and bathroom breaks, endured physical abuse and were paid wages so low they were unable to afford food.They dont understand what we have to live through, she says of the bosses in the fields, because we have families. The ad shows glimpses into her family life, with the children playing in a bedroom and waiting for a school bus.Three minutes into the five-minute ad, Mr. Sanders is finally heard from, giving a speech at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in 2015. He recalls what he found examining the farm workers plight, but it is Udelia who tells of Mr. Sanderss actions to address the situation, including holding hearings.I could buy small things for my children, she says. This changes a person.The ad closes with a quotation from a 2014 article in The New York Times that found progress in workers rights in the area."}

{"text": "How confident is Scott Blackmun, the chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee, that the Zika virus will not ruin the Rio Summer Olympics or render them unsafe for athletes, workers and spectators?Just last week, even though the number of people reported to have the virus in Brazil has topped 1.5 million and the World Health Organization has declared Zika a global health crisis, Blackmun bought tickets for his family: three children, who are in their 20s, and his wife.The risk is real, but I dont think that risk is high enough for me to cause me to change my travel plans, he told me in a phone call Thursday. Im telling you right here and right now, I think our mission is to support our athletes as they compete in the Olympics. As long as we have athletes who want to go, we will support them.Blackmuns voice, as well as his resolve, didnt waver. He is going to Brazil. His family is going. And the U.S.O.C. is headed there no matter what, because it has athletes who want to compete there no matter what.There is no question that many athletes dont want to miss the Games in August. They want to go, and they are pushing to go, despite the many unknowns of Zika, which so far have been highlighted by warnings to pregnant women about the possibility of birth defects in their unborn children, or children they may have one day. A new study by the medical journal The Lancet said Zika might lead to the neurological disorder Guillain-Barr syndrome, which can cause temporary paralysis and, in extreme cases, death.Those concerns are more than enough for some athletes, including the United States goalkeeper Hope Solo, to buck the prevailing feeling and say that they will consider skipping the Rio Games if they feel their health will be at risk. In speaking out, Solo, a prominent member of a prominent Olympic squad, may be showing more leadership than Olympic organizers, who seem to be dismissing what can be excruciatingly personal, unquestionably private concerns.It is bold of Solo to speak up, but other athletes and staff members who make up the Olympic traveling army  the family, friends, sponsors and journalists  might not be comfortable making such a public declaration. What of the borderline Olympian, not yet on the team, or an athlete in a less prominent sport?The volleyball star Kerri Walsh-Jennings competed at the London Games in 2012 while she was five weeks pregnant. If she had learned that on the eve of Rio 2016, and chose to skip the Games, few would have criticized her. But if a different athlete, in a different sport, decides to back out, it may put that person in an extremely uncomfortable position, caught between real concerns about the consequences for teams, and teammates, and even corporate sponsors who may have bankrolled the road the Rio.To someone like that, Blackmuns confidence may be reassuring. But what if his words still dont calm their nerves? Real-life consequences, both personal and professional, make the Zika issue much more worrisome, and the decision to speak out much more fraught, than Olympic organizers are suggesting.It just doesnt seem like a proper lead-up to an Olympics if there isnt the possibility that the Games will be a disaster. In Athens in 2004, in London in 2012 and in Sochi in 2014, it was the specter of terrorism. In Beijing in 2008, it was air quality. So, from an athletes perspective, it can be easy to look at this Zika issue and not even flinch.The swimmer Michael Phelps told The Associated Press this week that his fiance  and even his infant son, who is to be born in May  will attend the Games to watch him compete. Were not worried about it, he said of Zika.Phelpss attitude might seem cavalier, but no one can expect athletes who are as focused on their sport as he is to be influenced by a health scare. His fellow Olympic gold medalists Katie Ledecky and Missy Franklin said this week that they also had no concerns about Zika, and felt confident that the U.S.O.C. would do everything it could to keep them safe. Two sailors expressed the same thoughts to my colleague Christopher Clarey recently.Blackmun assured me that the athletes are right, that the U.S.O.C. is not taking the threat of the Zika virus lightly. The Olympic committee on Friday created a medical advisory group to evaluate the risks of Zika and to provide updates on the best way to keep athletes and Olympic staff safe.So far, according to Dr. Bill Moreau, the U.S.O.C.s managing director of sports medicine, the athletes will be armed with bug spray before they leave for Rio. Dr. Moreau also told Congress recently that the U.S.O.C. was considering pretreating its teams clothing with insecticide and issuing bed nets to keep the mosquitoes at bay.All of that, Blackmun said, would be to create the safest environment for the athletes, to minimize the risk.Not even once, Blackmun said, has anyone at the U.S.O.C. considered what would happen if the Zika crisis worsened, or if health officials suggested that Americans restrict travel to Brazil because of it. There has been no talk of relocating the Olympics, as FIFA once did with the Womens World Cup, which was moved to the United States from China in 2003 because of the SARS outbreak.I am unequivocally telling you that there is no Plan B, that Im aware of, Blackmun said. Its just too big an event. Its a multisport global event and it requires too much planning. Even if it were two years out, I dont think we can do it.Its the Olympics, and the people involved in it are wired to think positively. As in, theres positively no way that Zika will crash their party.Its an admirable attitude. Using preparation and education, the U.S.O.C. can only forge ahead. The problem is that Zika is forging ahead, too.It could be time to at least start sketching out a backup plan."}
{"text": "Louise Rennison, whose best-selling young-adult novels, starting with Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging, explore the joys and pains of adolescence, died on Monday in Brighton, England. She was 64.Her sister, Sophie Severs, confirmed the death without specifying a cause.Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging, published in 1999, is written in the form of a diary of a British teenager, named Georgia Nicolson, who is annoyed by her parents and wrestles to find her place in the world.It was a true-to-life hilarious retelling of my life at 15, Ms. Rennison wrote in an exuberant first-person essay in The Guardian in 2014.She would go on to write 10 books in the series, The Confessions of Georgia Nicolson, which were popular with young readers in Britain and around the world.As Ms. Rennison described it, she was a bit of an accidental novelist, becoming one in midlife. Already known in Britain for a one-woman show she had written and performed, she received a telephone call one day from a publisher who had read an article she had written for a newspaper about dating after the age of 35.As she recounted the call on her website: They said, We loved your article, it was so funny, would you like to write a book? And I thought, Ooh, how sophisticated! And she said, No, no, no, wed like you to write a teenage girls diary.And I said, Oh, Im quite flattered, but why me? And she said, Well, we read your article and we thought that it was so self-obsessed and so childish that you could really do a good job.The American edition of Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging included a glossary. Snogging, for example, meant kissing; joggerbums were jogging pants; and nuddy-pants was not wearing anything at all.They dont really get our language, Ms. Rennison said of Americans in The Guardian.The book was adapted into a film by Gurinder Chadha, the director of Bend It Like Beckham, in 2008.Many of the books in the Georgia Nicolson series made the New York Times best-seller list for children, including Knocked Out By My Nunga-Nungas, On the Bright Side, Im Now the Girlfriend of a Sex God, Away Laughing on a Fast Camel, and Dancing in My Nuddy-Pants, which made it to the top of the list of childrens chapter books in 2003. The series as a whole was included in the best-seller list in 2005 and 2008.Louise Patricia Rennison was born in Leeds, England, on Oct. 11, 1951. She moved to Wairakei, New Zealand, with her family when she was 15.In her 20s, having returned to England, she lived in the Notting Hill neighborhood of London and worked different jobs before taking a performing arts class and writing a one-woman show, Stevie Wonder Felt My Face.The show, about her life in London and what it was like being a girl, she said, went on tour and was made into a television special on BBC Two. She wrote other shows as well, including one titled Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head.Besides her sister, she is survived by her daughter, Kimberly Billing; her mother, Pauline Rennison; and a grandson.Ms. Rennisons HarperCollins biography said she researched her books by spending time with 14-year-olds.Brilliant  the best fun known to humanity, Ms. Rennison said. Its all boys, makeup, laughing and, er, thats it."}
{"text": "Im not sure whether anyone but me cares about the Romney-Trump spat over trade policy; its much more interesting, for normal human beings anyway, to talk about the size of Trumps, er, hands. For that matter, even Romneys past relationship with Trump is notable mainly because racism and birtherism didnt bother him back in the good old days. Still, the trade dispute is a revealing fight, on both sides.Actually, a bit of background: establishment Republicans may talk free trade, but they are if anything more protectionist than Democrats in practice (although neither party is seriously protectionist these days.) Remember, it was Bush, not a Democrat, who imposed a WTO-illegal steel tariff, then had to back down in the face of European pressure. And going back, remember that Reagan, not Carter, imposed import quotas on Japanese cars.The reason for this difference, I think, is twofold. First, Republicans are much less respectful of international obligations; it took a while for the Bushies to realize that trade rules apply to us, too, and that the EU is as big a trade superpower as we are. Second, theres a level of cynicism, of willingness to play politics with foreign affairs, on one side that isnt matched on the other.Which brings me to the latest fight. Romney declares with horror that Trump would start a trade war. His economics is all wrong, which is the main thing; but its also worth noting that thee and a half years ago Romney himself argued for exactly the same policies Trump advocates now, blithely dismissing the dangers:Ive watched year in and year out as companies have shut down and people have lost their jobs because China has not played by the same rules, in part by holding down artificially the value of their currency, Mr. Romney said.Asked about the possibility of a trade war at his debate with President Obama, Mr. Romney said one was already under way. Its a silent one, and theyre winning, he said. We cant just surrender and lose jobs.Now, Romney could argue that the situation has changed  as it has since 2010, when I was arguing for the threat of countervailing duties. Back then China was in fact engaged in harmful currency manipulation; these days its bleeding reserves in the face of YUGE capital outflows (a trillion dollars last year!) that is, its intervening to prop the yuan up, not hold it down. But thats not the case Romney is making.So how do we score this debate? Four Pinnochios on each side. Romney talks nonsense economics, and condemns as terrible the very policies he himself called for not long ago. But Trump is stuck in a time warp, making arguments that had some force when China was booming but none in the current situation.Sorry, but no winners here, just big losers. Sad."}
{"text": "Brilliant, tedious and irredeemably evil, Leni Riefenstahls Triumph of the Will (1935) is one of the great conundrums of cinema history.A supremely artful feature-length recording of the 1934 Nazi Party Congress, commissioned, according its credits, by order of the Fhrer, Triumph of the Will raises a host of moral and aesthetic questions. (The only real equivalent is D. W. Griffiths white supremacist magnum opus, The Birth of a Nation.) Is Triumph of the Will a brilliantly innovative documentary? Is it a propaganda masterpiece? A work of art  or simply, as Zero Mostel says in The Producers of his calculated Broadway flop, a love letter to Hitler?Riefenstahl (1902-2003), who produced, directed and for a time distributed the film (reissued on Blu-ray by Synapse Films), denied political intent, claiming that the film was cinema vrit. In reality, it was a colossal photo op. The three-day congress and the movie were planned simultaneously. Riefenstahl had a small army of technicians, including 16 uniformed cameramen, at her disposal. The City of Nuremberg contributed constructions, some designed by Albert Speer, to facilitate her films dramatic low or overhead angles, strategic dolly shots and dynamic use of scale.Triumph of the Will is also an organic product of cinema history. Riefenstahl and Speer emulated the monumentalism and ornamental patterns of Fritz Langs silent films like Metropolis; the Nazi leadership wanted the German equivalent of the Soviet propaganda hit Battleship Potemkin. But where Potemkin was a film drama designed to look like a newsreel, Triumph of the Will was a newsreel contrived to work like a drama, if not a myth.Riefenstahls mass formations of marching members of the Hitler Youth remind many film historians of the dance numbers choreographed in Hollywood by Busby Berkeley. Like Berkeley, Riefenstahl understood the power of synchronized sound. The music in her film is nearly continuous; shots showing a sea of Nazi banners or a forest of upraised arms are edited to the beat.Triumph of the Will is a demonstration of cinematic might  and guile. The impression of a totally organized and controlled Woodstock-like event was achieved through rehearsals, camera placement, inserted footage and post-dubbing, as with the supposedly spontaneous choral singing and the thunderous cries of Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Fhrer!Production numbers aside, Triumph of the Will is devoted largely to speechifying. While Hitler is a star performer, who practiced his histrionic gestures before a mirror, his colleagues are not. So stupefying are their exhortations and oaths of fealty, the movie might have been made as much to lull as to agitate. By the time it ends, after a lugubrious third nighttime rally, with a mass rendition of the Nazi anthem The Horst Wessel Song, you expect to see a giant swastika go into a hypnotic spin.A virtual pariah after the war, Riefenstahl was a strenuous advocate for her rehabilitation. Her comeback suffered a major setback with Susan Sontags 1975 essay Fascinating Fascism  which eviscerated the artists whitewashing of her past  but Riefenstahl was embraced by many cinastes. She was honored by the Telluride Film Festival and profiled in Vanity Fair. The critic John Simon called her one of the supreme artists of the cinema. Triumph of the Will was named to Anthology Film Archives canon of essential cinema. The shot in which Hitler and two associates solemnly walk through the assembled mass is quoted in the ceremony that concludes the 1977 Star Wars.Film Culture magazine put Riefenstahl on the cover of its Spring 1973 issue and paid tribute with a dozen articles. One by Ken Kelman, a member of the Anthology Film Archives selection committee, extolled Triumph of the Will as the definitive cinematic obliteration of the division between fantasy and reality. For me, its impossible not to read that as a warning.Starting with Charlie Chaplins The Great Dictator, Triumph of the Will provided material for anti-Nazi satire; it also figured as an image of the Nazi new order in Hollywoods wartime efforts. Two examples, Hitlers Children and Hitlers Madman (both quickly made low-budget films from 1943), are available on DVD from Warner Archive.Hitlers Children is framed by miniature versions of the Nuremberg Congress, with German teenagers clustered around a bonfire consecrating their lives to the Fhrer. Lurid yet turgid, the movie is a tale of doomed puppy love, Nazi eugenics and sexual sadism. Ads featured the image of a freedom-loving American girl (Bonita Granville, Hollywoods original Nancy Drew) given a ritual flogging by a member of the SS.A far better movie, Hitlers Madman evokes a larger Nazi atrocity: the destruction of Lidice, a Czech town where all the male inhabitants were executed in revenge for the assassination of their German overlord Reinhard Heydrich, a key figure in the Nazi hierarchy (who makes a cameo appearance in Triumph of the Will).Like Hangmen Also Die! (1943), Fritz Langs film on the same subject, Hitlers Madman involved significant German migr talent: It was produced by Seymour Nebenzal, whose credits included Langs M, and was directed by the recently arrived Douglas Sirk. Eugen Schfftan, who shot Metropolis, worked (uncredited) on the cinematography; Edgar G. Ulmer (also uncredited) was responsible for the sets.The Nazis are portrayed as viciously anti-Christian. (Although the screenplay was partly written by the Yiddish-language playwright Peretz Hirschbein, Nazi anti-Semitism is not a factor.) Religious iconography adds to the dark fairy-tale ambience. The most alarming special effect is John Carradines performance as Heydrich, gaunt and implacable as a medieval Death.Sirk intended his movie to be almost like a documentary, Carradines cold, self-dramatizing impersonation not least. The filmmaker had once met Heydrich at a Berlin reception. Carradine was Heydrich, he told an interviewer, adding, a lot of Nazis behaved like Shakespearean actors.NEWLY RELEASEDEXPERIMENTER Michael Almereydas experimental docudrama stars Peter Sarsgaard as the social scientist Stanley Milgram, whose psychological tests, inspired in part by the trial of the Nazi official Adolf Eichmann, were designed to plumb the nature of totalitarian obedience. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called it less a straight biography than a diverting gloss on human behavior, historical memory and cinema itself. Available on Blu-ray, DVD and Amazon Video. (Magnolia)NIGHT WILL FALL Made for HBO and now on DVD, Andr Singers restrained but harrowing documentary depicts the fate of the atrocity footage shot by British cameramen attached to the soldiers who liberated German concentration camps. Not a film youre likely to forget, Mike Hale wrote in The Times. (Warner Bros.)PRESSURE POINT Sidney Poitier plays a tightly wound prison psychiatrist saddled with Bobby Darins American Nazi patient in this 1962 drama produced by Stanley Kramer, reissued on Blu-ray. The Times critic Bosley Crowther praised Mr. Poitiers coolly forceful performance and noted that, as was intended, Mr. Darins portrayal should make anyone recoil. (Olive Films)SHADOWS AND FOG Woody Allen visits the dark heart of Europe in this stab at a comic, mock Expressionist tribute to Franz Kafka, Fritz Lang and Kurt Weill, now available on Blu-ray. The Times critic Vincent Canby called the movie a mixture of the sincere, the sardonic and the classically sappy when it opened in New York in 1992. (Twilight Time)WELCOME TO LEITH The documentarians Michael Beach Nichols and Christopher K. Walker report on a neo-Nazi white supremacist attempt to take over a small town in North Dakota. In his review for The Times, Stephen Holden described a few moments in which the film might be mistaken for a horror movie about an alien invasion. On DVD. (First Run Features)"}
{"text": "MOSCOW  The Soviet Union acknowledged last night [March 5] that though the group flight of Venus-2 and Venus-3 was a great technological achievement, it was a scientific failure. Neither of the two spaceships  each weighing more than a ton  returned any information about the cloud-covered planet.The radios on both failed some time before the one flew by the planet at a distance of only 14,900 miles and the other crashed into it. A statement by Tass, the Soviet news agency, said technicians here are still hoping to re-establish radio contact with Venus-2 and coax from it the pictures of the planet it took along with other scientific information.The detailed statement about the purposes and achievements of the twin flight also included for the first time the hint that a special capsule ejected from Venus-3 attempted a soft or semi-soft parachute-assisted landing on the Venusian surface.New York Herald Tribune, European Edition, March 7, 1966"}
{"text": "Brent Bouchez opened Agency Five0 six years ago in New York as an advertising firm specializing in marketing to baby boomers, on the assumption that companies would need to tune their messages differently as the last of the boomers headed into their 50s.But the firm has only just landed its first boomer-targeted marketing effort with real spending behind it, Mr. Bouchez said. Two years ago, he started another agency, Bouchez Page, to capture a wider range of business.What held us back was the very idea of 50, he said. We heard I cant go to my boss and say Im going to an agency that targets 50-plus. Mr. Bouchez and other specialists in marketing to baby boomers, the more than 75 million Americans born roughly from 1946 through 1964, said companies recognized the economic value of the group but were hesitant to shift marketing budgets away from the 83 million millennials, those born from 1982 to 2000, who remain the holy grail of advertisers.A result is what marketers call a transitional phase in which millennials and boomers will be increasingly targeted in messages that try to bridge the groups.Companies want to reach boomers, but they want to do it with their general advertising message, usually a message created by and for a millennial target, Mr. Bouchez said. No mainstream brand has spent money on a targeted creative campaign for boomers.Thus far, if the aging consumer is the primary target, the pharmaceutical and retirement-related financial sectors are doing the marketing.Consequently, boomers say they feel underserved by marketing.We did a survey of boomer perceptions of marketing directed at them, and over 80 percent said they feel advertisers are making mistakes, either with the wrong message or the wrong offer, said Dave Austin, managing director of Influent50, a marketing agency created by AARP last year to help companies with branding for its members.Were tired of the idea that if you put a Rolling Stones song on a commercial, youll reach the over-50s, he said. It doesnt work that way.Some ads that try to take a more age-inclusive approach have hit the target, marketers said, particularly the fashion industrys campaigns that include women older than 50, a big change from its well-known obsession with youth.Two examples are Gaps Dress Normal campaign, with Anjelica Huston and various other celebrities of different ages, and LOrals Paris line, which features women of different ages, including Helen Mirren and Blake Lively.Peter Hubbell, founder of BoomAgers, a New York-based advertising agency and marketing consultancy focused on the aging consumer, said boomers would respect those brands that represent them faithfully while appealing to their values and ambitions at this stage of their lives.Brands for whom boomers are obvious targets are also trying to focus on what people over 50 see as the best years of their lives.As part of its recent Made to Move campaign about Osteo Bi-Flex, its joint health supplement, NBTY of Ronkonkoma, N.Y., portrayed a 50-something woman doing yoga beside her daughter.After easily rotating her shoulder with a vertical arm stretch, she whispers to the male instructor that her daughter is single, prompting protest from the daughter. It also supports wonderfully high levels of humiliation in her daughter, says the voice-over.While the ad is not without its detractors  some specialists in marketing to people over 50 said it reinforced the clich that older people say embarrassingly inappropriate things  it is meant to reflect boomer values, even if it is at the expense of the daughters feelings.The ad demonstrates that we really know who boomers are and how our product can help them maintain their active lifestyle, said Andre Branch, the companys chief marketing officer. The humor is there, but its not contrived. Its about the feeling of empowerment, being who they want to be.The superior buying power of the boomers compared with the millennials is clearly one factor forcing marketers to recalibrate their messages.According to a four-year-old Nielsen-BoomAger study, by 2017 nearly 50 percent of the United States adult population will be 50 and older and will control 70 percent of the countrys disposable income. Moreover, that group stands to inherit $15 trillion in the next 20 years.In contrast, 75 percent of millennials can afford to buy only what they need, not what they want, according to a 2015 study by BoomAger and the Natural Marketing Institute. In addition, 45 percent of them are not employed and 23 percent have college debt.Many millennials will not enter their prime earning and spending years until 2020, and most not until 2030, Mr. Hubbell said. Sobering news if you put all your eggs in this basket.Media consumption habits are also working toward increased marketing spending to reach boomers. According to Brian Nguyen, communications strategy director at Droga5, a New York-based advertising agency, use of mobile, tablet, video and social sharing is evening out between the groups.In addition, streaming services like Netflix and Amazon are developing content targeted to boomers.As media touch points increase and buying power remains strong, marketers will have more and more compelling reasons to boomerang back to boomers, Mr. Nguyen said.He predicted that in the next two to three years marketers would work increasingly to blend strategies that address millennials and boomers.Here at Droga5, weve already begun to take a more age-agnostic approach, he said, by building campaigns on truths and insights rather than arbitrary assumptions based on generational stereotypes."}

{"text": "SEOUL, South Korea   In late 2014, months after 304 people died in the sinking of a South Korean ferry, a leaflet began circulating with a scurrilous rumor about President Park Geun-hye: that she had failed to respond swiftly to the disaster that day because she was having a romantic encounter with a former aide.Was Ms. Park, the flier asked, now cracking down on her critics in an attempt to keep that scandal from coming to light?For Park Sung-su, an antigovernment campaigner who had distributed the leaflet  and who is not related to the president (Park is a common surname here)  the consequences soon followed. He was arrested and later sentenced to a year in prison, on charges of defaming the president and staging illegal protests against his prosecutors. He was freed in December after eight months, when a court suspended his sentence.No evidence supporting the rumor has been produced, and prosecutors said they had investigated and found it groundless. But however dubious the leaflet might have been, opponents of the government say Mr. Park became another victim of the very thing he was denouncing: the governments use of defamation and other laws to silence its critics, which rights advocates say is on the rise.Last year, the United Nations Human Rights Committee warned against South Koreas increasing use of criminal defamation laws to prosecute persons who criticize government action. Freedom House, a rights group based in Washington, criticized the increased intimidation of political opponents under Ms. Park, who took office in 2013.The government is especially sensitive about defending the personal reputation of the president, said Park Kyung-sin, a professor of law at Korea University who has researched the issue.The Constitution guarantees freedom of expression. But defamation laws here carry penalties that include prison  up to three years for comments that are true and up to seven for statements considered false  if they are deemed not in the public interest. Critics say the distinction is vague and opens the door to abuse by prosecutors.The governments use of the laws against critics predates Ms. Parks presidency. During the five-year tenure of her predecessor, Lee Myung-bak, 30 such cases were filed, 24 of them criminal and six civil, according to Peoples Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, an influential South Korean civic group. But under Ms. Park, the trend increased considerably, with 22 cases filed in her first two and a half years in office, the group said. Of those, 18 were criminal prosecutions.They dont seem to care whether they win these cases, the group said in a recent report, noting that the officials often lose in court. The real purpose is to create a chilling effect among people criticizing and scrutinizing the government.Ms. Parks office rejected such criticism, saying all democratic rights were protected.Charges that her administration was suppressing political rights sprang up almost as soon as Ms. Park  whose father, the military dictator Park Chung-hee, ruled South Korea with an iron fist during the 1960s and 70s  assumed office.In 2013, the National Intelligence Service, a powerful spy agency that her father used to torture and silence dissidents, moved to disband an outspoken progressive party. The agency arrested the partys leaders on charges of violating the Cold War-era National Security Law, which bans activities deemed pro-North Korean.Distrust of the spy agency deepened after it was accused of interfering on Ms. Parks behalf during the 2012 presidential campaign. A former director of the agency, Won Sei-hoon, was convicted of running a team of officers who posted comments online criticizing Ms. Parks rivals before the election. In 2014, agency employees were convicted of fabricating Chinese immigration documents to concoct a spy case against an ethnic Chinese refugee from North Korea.When human rights lawyers and journalists brought those tactics to light in 2013, saying the agency was resorting to old habits of coercion and faking evidence, counterintelligence officials responded by filing defamation cases.The governments use of the defamation laws became a diplomatic issue when Japan complained after the 2014 indictment of Tatsuya Kato, a journalist from the Japanese newspaper Sankei Shimbun, for reporting the rumor about Ms. Park and her former aide.An opposition lawmaker, Park Jie-won, said the indictment had embarrassed the country. Its prosecutors who should be indicted for defaming South Korea, he said.Mr. Kato was acquitted in December. But Mr. Park, the lawmaker, has been charged with defamation after airing suspicions that the former aide and others close to the president had arranged for favored officials to be promoted. Presidential aides sued six journalists from a South Korean newspaper for reporting similar allegations, which Ms. Parks office denied.Besides the defamation laws, the governments use of the National Security Law has long been seen by international human rights groups, as well as the United States State Department, as a threat to free speech. Since 2014, a Chinese student and a Korean-American lecturer have been deported for comments seen as sympathetic to North Korea. Longstanding fears of the North, especially among conservatives, have stymied efforts to repeal or revise the law.Attempts to amend the defamation laws have also been unsuccessful. Last month, the Constitutional Court struck down a proposal to ban defamation charges in cases where the supposedly defamatory comment circulated online is true. Bills that would bar government officials from filing defamation cases have stalled in Parliament.Ms. Parks governing party has pushed what it calls antiterrorism legislation through Parliament after her office warned of possible terrorist attacks from North Korea in the wake of the Norths recent nuclear test. Opposition lawmakers say the bill would give the National Intelligence Service, which has a history of illegally wiretapping politicians, journalists and others, more power to monitor not just terrorism suspects but also government critics, particularly online.I can never support this attempt to place a dog collar on the people, Eun Soo-mi, an opposition lawmaker who was once tortured by the spy agency, said during a 10-hour filibuster against the bill, which was approved but has not yet become law. (Thirty-eight opposition lawmakers, some referring to Big Brother, from George Orwells novel 1984, filibustered against the bill in a series of speeches for a record eight days.)The governments policing of the Internet, a popular channel for antigovernment grievances, was already an issue under Ms. Park. In 2014, after months of withering criticism about how she had handled the ferry disaster, Ms. Park warned that some of it had gone too far. Prosecutors soon announced a crackdown on false or defamatory data in cyberspace.Kakao Talk, a popular smartphone-based messenger service, then admitted that it had been cooperating with the police and prosecutors to collect the online chat records of thousands of users, including antigovernment demonstrators. Last month, a court ruled in favor of one of those protesters, concluding that the inspection of her records was unlawful because it had been conducted without her knowledge.Such rulings aside, critics argue that South Korean prosecutors and judges have largely failed to protect the publics rights, often because they want to earn the favor of politicians who can promote them.People are lamenting that there are no watchdogs, but only dogs, Kwon Seok-cheon, a columnist for the newspaper JoongAng Ilbo, recently wrote.Park Sung-su, the activist who spread the rumor about the president and her former aide, made use of the same metaphor after police officers raided his home. He called them running dogs for the government, later throwing dog food at the gates of police stations. In April, he was arrested on the charge of staging an illegal rally and then interrogated after he and several other activists had shouted, Bow wow! in front of a prosecutors office.They kept asking me what was the political meaning of bow wow, he said."}
{"text": "Every March, as St. Patricks Day approaches and Yeats and stout and the Undertones and other Irish matters are on my mind, I recall a conversation I often have. A friend is about to go to Ireland for the first time and asks me for recommendations. Inevitably, the first thing I say is: Dont skip the North.This advice is usually met with skepticism. Memories of news about Northern Ireland during the Troubles  the 30-year period of conflict during which violence frequently flared up  still linger long after the Good Friday agreement of 1998, and many people remain wary of visiting. Thats a real shame, because Northern Ireland is home to some of that green islands most spectacular scenery, and its capital, Belfast, is among my all-time-favorite drinking cities.Belfast is compact and brimming with distinctive bars full of character, particularly in the Cathedral Quarter, an arty district with St. Annes Cathedral at its heart. On a business trip in 2010, I was staying in the Quarter at the elegant Merchant Hotel, mostly because I had heard great things about its cocktail bar. I knew nothing about the Spaniard, a bar across the street from the Merchant, but decided to check it out. Appealingly cozy and dark, with most of its surfaces taken up by pictures and knickknacks, it felt like the sort of place where an unusually well-mannered pirate might make himself at home. I arrived with a sore throat, for which the quick-thinking barman prescribed an excellent hot whiskey (I later discovered the bars winning way with rum cocktails). A local woman  an off-duty constable  struck up a conversation. I mentioned that I was a writer, and she insisted that I next join her and her friends at the John Hewitt, a bar named for a Belfast poet and activist.When we got there, a folk trio was playing, and playing well. A fire burned in a small hearth. I drank a pint of rich porter from a local brewery and was swept up in convivial chatter by everyone around me. Reading the fine print on the menu, I learned that the bar is operated by the Belfast Unemployed Resource Center and that its profits benefit the organization. I thought it was an ingenious model, and I knew the Hewitt would become a bar Id return to on every trip to Belfast.I also return to the majestic Crown Liquor Saloon, a confection of ornate tile work, stained glass, high ceilings and intricately carved woodwork. The tough choice here is whether to belly up to the bar or try to claim one of the intimate snugs  private booths designed, it is said, for those who wish to drink discreetly.I have wondered if the very things that put people off when I implore them to visit Belfast  the citys complex history and its enduring, though softening, scars  are what make the warmth and hospitality I have discovered in its bars not only surprising but also especially deep and affecting. Drink in Belfast. Youll have a great time. Youll meet great people. And give my best regards to all.Recipes: The Rumpolitan | The Nico Melendez"}
{"text": "When asked to be nuttier, the dancer Emily Stone hesitated. She was rehearsing a section of Trisha Browns 1979 Glacial Decoy with guidance from Stephen Petronio, who wanted to recapture the full abandon of the original, or at least his memory of the original.Try making a sound when you do it, said Mr. Petronio, who never danced in the work but had seen it countless times in rehearsal and performance. Ms. Stone flung her arms out in front of her, letting them jangle along with the vibrations of her voice. What had looked tentative a few minutes ago now looked electric, a little cyclone sweeping through the studio. Mr. Petronio approved.Members of the Stephen Petronio Company are no strangers to turbulent movement. For over 30 years, Mr. Petronio, 59, has been making brash, hyperkinetic dances that demand precision, attack and a sense of adventure from his dancers. Two of his works, MiddleSexGorge (1990), created in response to the AIDS crisis, and Big Daddy (Deluxe), a new piece inspired by his father, are on the program for his companys annual Joyce Theater season, which opens Tuesday, March 8.But Glacial Decoy, the programs centerpiece, calls for a different kind of wildness: something more slippery, more released. Its a quality that Mr. Petronio, as a former member of Trisha Browns company, knows intimately.His troupes acquisition of Glacial Decoy, licensed by Ms. Browns company, is the latest phase of Bloodlines, a project he started in 2014 to honor the artists who have influenced him and, in doing so, preserve groundbreaking works of modern and postmodern dance. The initiative began with a restaging of Merce Cunninghams 1968 RainForest and also celebrates the rebels of Judson Dance Theater, who toppled conventions of modern dance in the 1960s.Mr. Petronios career sprang most directly from two of those renegades: Steve Paxton, whose Contact Improvisation class he discovered as a Hampshire College freshman, and Ms. Brown, with whom he danced from 1979 to 1986. While his style has veered from hers, it shares some kinesthetic DNA.Theres a softness and an elusiveness in Trishas work, where theres a stridency in mine that Ive counterpunched with, Mr. Petronio said recently at the Joyces studios in Midtown. But I come from that very soft and released place. While he may emphasize pushing away from the floor  in a very taut way, he said  that doesnt preclude giving in to gravity.Ms. Browns early works, enamored of gravity, explored the physics of simple actions like walking, falling and leaning. These led to more intricate investigations in the mid-1970s. She choreographed for untraditional spaces: galleries, rooftops, the side of a building. When Mr. Petronio joined her company at 23  her first male dancer  she had just completed her first work for the proscenium stage. A collaboration with Robert Rauschenberg, it featured four women (and later, a surreptitious fifth) in Rauschenbergs diaphanous white dresses, dancing in silence against the backdrop of his photographic slides.That work was Glacial Decoy, now considered one of Ms. Browns masterpieces for its stealthy critique of the proscenium, among other innovations. Its final section shuttles a row of dancers out of and into the wings, as if by conveyor belt, suggesting that the stage  and the dance  goes on forever. As Lisa Kraus, one of the original cast members, said in a recent phone interview, It rings the world, this dance.Ms. Brown was also in the original cast, and Mr. Petronio would often lend an outside eye in rehearsals  but not more. He recalls asking to learn the piece, and her direct reply: Its not for men. Puzzled at first by that rule, he has since come to see Glacial Decoy as what he describes as a great feminist work defined by a complexity that to me could only be characterized as female.It goes from state to state very quickly, he said, noting its shifts from outlandish to cool to lushly romantic. That kind of facility seems not at all masculine to me.To restage the work, Mr. Petronio brought in Ms. Kraus and Diane Madden, the Trisha Brown Dance Companys associate artistic director. Ms. Stone, of the nutty sequence, said that she and her colleagues were inclined to hit each move and give it that Petronio slash we know so well, that intensity. Ms. Kraus and Ms. Madden helped them find a wider dynamic range.I remember Lisa saying, in terms of each little movement in the phrase, Do it and get off it, Ms. Stone said. Which meant, just do the movement and move on to the next one, because the next one is just as important as the one that came before. Its almost surreal. Ive never danced that way before.Ms. Kraus said she wanted to impart the spirit of play that Ms. Brown brought to the studio, which allowed for moments like one dancer running and crashing into another. That kind of thing could happen in rehearsal because we knew Trisha was into something outrageous, something risky, something really playful.Ms. Brown learned she had vascular dementia several years ago and now lives in Texas, where Mr. Petronio has visited her. In January at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, her company gave its last New York performances of her proscenium works. So the Bloodlines restaging comes at an important time.This is how her proscenium works will live on, Ms. Kraus said. Theyll be licensed. They wont live on through her company. At least not in their original form  the company will focus instead on reinventing her dances through its site-specific series, Trisha Brown: In Plain Site.When Mr. Petronio watches Glacial Decoy, he sees not only Ms. Brown the choreographer but also Ms. Brown the dancer, at 40, at the height of her career.She danced beautifully for many years after, but at 40, I mean, Im sorry you didnt get to see it, because it was amazing, he said. You think of Trisha as cool and intellectual, but she was also a wild animal, and thats the part of her that I responded to. So to bring that portrait of a wild and crazily intelligent woman in her prime into my studio, it was emotional. Because although she cant move now, shes moving in my women, and I can feel her."}
{"text": "After 22 years, the divorce didnt work out for Sagan Lewis and Tom Fontana.They tried to maintain a severed union. And for more than two decades, they were successful. Ms. Lewis, a former actress, lived in the verdant tangle of Hawaii and then Arizona; he moved to the cobblestones of the West Village.She had a child on her own; he wrote and produced some of the most hard-edge, violent shows on television. They saw each other on occasion and still loved each other, but were not, emphatically, a couple.And yet, something kept bringing them together again. Finally, as if orchestrated by a Hollywood show-runner, in July, the woman who found comfort in the red rocks of Sedona and the man who lives in a 10,000-square-foot building in Manhattan, remarried.I realized I loved Sagan more than having all this space to myself, said Mr. Fontana, 64, the Emmy- and Peabody-award winning writer, producer and creator of TV shows including Homicide, Oz and Borgia. By this point in our lives, all that crud  career, ego, agenda, being obstinate because you think youre right  is gone. Theres no more testing.They are not alone in their cycle of marriage, divorce and remarriage  to each other. Phil Collins, the chronicler of failed relationships, recently reconciled with his third ex-wife, Orianne Cevey, after an eight-year separation (and $48 million divorce).Well, you know, we realized we made a mistake, Mr. Collins told CBS This Morning in an interview this week. He recalled that his son Matthew from that marriage told him: He just wished that it would happen. I was very moved. The singer added, Its simple: We missed each other.They join the ranks of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton; Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner; Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson; Judith Sheindlin (Judge Judy) and Jerry Sheindlin; and Marie Osmond and Stephen Craig, who became her third (and first) husband.The idea of a marriage reprise has seeped into popular culture, too, The Parent Trap notwithstanding. In the 2009 film Its Complicated, the divorced couple, played by Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin, consider reconciling, much to their childrens dismay.Very, very few try to start over again, said Nancy Kalish, a former psychology professor at California State University, Sacramento, who has been studying divorced couples for decades.Most divorced people dont ever want to speak to each other again, and some struggle to do so for the good of their children, she said. Of the ones who do reconcile, she said, those who have been most successful in rebuilding their former marriages were much younger when they parted and had been separated a long time.Many people dont ever account for the fact that after the intensity of the separation and divorce dies down, there will come a time when theyll actually miss their spouse, said Michele Weiner-Davis, a marriage therapist and director of the Divorce Busting Center in Boulder, Colo. And they think, what could I have done differently? Thats when they begin to wonder whether they made a mistake.Thats what happened with April and Mike Davidson, of Grand Ledge, Mich. They met when she was 18 and he was 25; by the time she was 30, she was the mother of five.It sounds so clich, but I completely lost who I was, said Ms. Davidson, now 38. I became Mikes wife, and so and sos mom. Wed put the kids to bed and then argue.She went back to school, made friends of her own and took a job. She was happier, she said, but her newfound independence threatened her husband.They tried couples therapy to no avail; in 2009, they divorced, negotiating the terms of their split in a draft Google document. They amicably co-parented, and dated other people.But one day she caught a Facebook photograph of her ex-husbands new girlfriend, a woman similar to the person she had become. She was my age, a businesswoman, superconfident and I was like, what? Ms. Davidson said. He had found someone like me. I felt like we failed, both of us.She was flooded with rage, she said, and called her ex and vented. But instead of lobbing daggers back at her, he invited her out for coffee. She went.There was this spark that scared the hell out of me, she said. I hadnt looked a him without bitterness in years. He walked her back to her car, and as if propelled by some supernatural force, she leaned over and kissed him.In June 2012, three years after their divorce was final, he moved into the house Ms. Davidson had purchased following the dissolution of their union.People really can change through loss, said Wendy Paris, author of Splitopia: Dispatches From Todays Good Divorce and How to Part Well. They dont change through criticism in a contentious marriage.After divorce, your ex still has your words in her head, Ms. Paris said. She could change into someone you get along with a lot better. Also, you might change. You could become more confident and reconnected to important parts of yourself once youre no longer locked in the adversarial position-taking that often develops in a bad marriage. That confidence or clarity can translate into being more generous and magnanimous of spirit, more accepting.Ms. Weiner-Davis concurs, saying, Very often they come to the relationship with a new maturity and a willingness to learn how things got in disrepair to begin with, and theyre more willing to take a look at what each person can do differently so that they dont find themselves in the same position again.Logistics and practicalities play a role; so does sheer exhaustion. Exploring the scintillating world of Tinder may seem appealing to someone whos been in a committed relationship for eons. But after a while, they may conclude that the devil they know just may be better than the devil they dont know (or, more pointedly, dont know as well.)Then there are financial considerations, especially when children are involved. Tiffany Beverlin, the founder and chief executive of Dreams Recycled, a marketplace and community for those who are divorced, regularly talks to couples who have reunited.Its hard to be a single parent, responsible for child care and house and mortgage, she said. Trying to blend two families and two schedules is such a challenge.And then theres the fact that people grow in different ways, and their needs and wants dont always align  until, miraculously, they do.This was the case with Mr. Fontana and Ms. Lewis, who met in 1978, when she auditioned for the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts, and he was the artistic directors slave.They lived together in New York, and then Mr. Fontana got a writing job in Los Angeles on the show St. Elsewhere, which was produced by Bruce Paltrow, who wrote a part for Ms. Lewis on the show.On Dec. 18, 1982, Mr. Fontana and Ms. Lewis married in the backyard of the Paltrow familys home in Santa Monica, Calif.The couple continued for a few years, each growing dissatisfied with their lives. Not with each other, but with their circumstances. Mr. Fontana was unhappy with Los Angeles. I found it empty, he said.Ms. Lewis said she found herself less career focused and more spiritually depleted. But New York wasnt her dream; she was inspired by hiking the Santa Monica Mountains and staring at the Pacific Ocean.When they finally came to the conclusion in 1993 that they should split, they did it with lan, with a Final Anniversary Party. At the bottom of their invitation was this request: If you must bring a gift, bring two.I was sad when we split up, Ms. Lewis said. Toms such a great human being. It was like, Why am I needing to do something else when I have this great guy? If hed been a jerk, it would have been easy. It was hard for both of us but we knew it was necessary. He understood that I needed to explore other worlds.Ms. Lewis moved to Maui, and then Sedona, where she taught acting workshops and became program director at the Sedona International Film Festival. About three years after she and Mr. Fontana divorced, she discovered she was pregnant. It was a shock: she and Mr. Fontana had been told that she was unable to have children.Ms. Lewis always planned to raise her son, Jade Scott Lewis, alone. But Mr. Fontana was a part of his life. The three spent some holidays together in New York or Omaha, where she was born, and it was always comfortable. And then a few years ago, after they visited in New York, Mr. Fontana found himself missing her more than usual.Jade was coming to N.Y.U. for grad school, I was here, he said. I thought, why werent we a family?At Christmas 2014, he proposed. She accepted, and they were remarried in July 2015. The couple then took the wedding celebration on tour, with parties in New York, Los Angeles, Omaha and Buffalo, where Mr. Fontana has family. They have upcoming events in Sedona and Maui.Their grand New York party took place Dec. 19 at the Tribeca Rooftop  35 years and one day after their first wedding. The invitation was an updated version of their original invitation of the two of them kissing, along with this phrase: After 22 years, the divorce didnt work out.Both stress they wouldnt have had it any other way. Ms. Lewis attributes the split for Mr. Fontanas artistic prowess. If Tom and I had stayed happily married and not gone our separate ways, Im not sure those shows would have happened, she said. I think in his being alone, in life without a mate, I think he really explored the edges of humanity in his writing mind. He went places that I may have said, Oh, dont do that.Mr. Fontana agreed with her assessment. After the demise of their marriage, he was totally adrift. His father had just died; he was freshly divorced; his first TV job was winding down. I was sort of liberated in a way to go like: Who are you? And what are the parts or yourself that you need to figure out?When youre going to write shows like Homicide and Oz, you are testing the extremes in life, he said. Youre going to the darkest place. But there was redemption on both shows, too.Ms. Davidson also believes that divorcing was the best thing she and her husband could have done (they got re-engaged in the spring of 2013; while they refer to each other as husband and wife, they have not yet legalized the titles).We just raced through life from 21 to 31, she said. We lived such an epically fast rate that there was no time for growth. We were both teaching our kids this is what marriage looks like: two people who are unhappy. I dont want them to feel that way.Still, their reconciliation wasnt that smooth. Friends and family were confused: they had taken sides, but were now being told to forget everything they had heard about the other person.Their daughter Josephine, who was 9 when her parents separated and 12 when they reconciled, was furious.I asked why they would get divorced if only to get back together, said Josephine, now 14. They said they just needed a break from each other and theyre able to be more compatible now. Im definitely glad now. They seem happier than they did before. But I thought it was kind of dumb to split up and have the kids get used to that situation and then randomly get back together without any notice.Mr. Davidson said: Our relationship started with a power imbalance, which continued during our marriage, even through ample evidence that it was unhealthy. When it finally fell apart, I was unwilling to make the change that was needed. Instead of embracing equilibrium, I clutched tighter than ever to hold on to control. It took a long time to understand this, and its certainly not something Im proud of, but it was an important lesson. Equality is the foundation of our new relationship.Anything that happened that reminded me of the past brought up angry feelings, and we had to experience all that again, April Davidson said. But instead of glossing over it, we had to hash it out. It was messy, but good messy. Sometimes you have to wade in the messy a little bit to come out the other side.Read more: Remarrying the Ex: Ilze Thielmann and Aitken Thompson Try Again10 Newlyweds Share the Unexpected Ways They Met"}
{"text": "Few would dispute the notion that apartments have become over-the-top expensive for many New Yorkers. But just how very far out of reach can still be surprising.The median price of a studio, long considered an entry-level apartment, in Manhattan is now $485,000, according to the Corcoran Group. If that price does not make your hair stand on end, consider that in the coveted submarket of Downtown Manhattan, the median price of a resale condo studio hit $863,000 in the last quarter of 2015.But back to the buyer in the half-million-buck bracket. What this will purchase in Manhattan is likely little more than a single room with a windowless kitchen.For those who absolutely must be in the city, the other boroughs are generally cheaper, and the offerings roomier. But the trade-off for that extra square footage might be limited shopping and dining options, so-so schools and long commutes.Using online services like nytimes.com/findahome and StreetEasy.com, it was possible to find many existing apartments and houses for $500,000 or less beyond Manhattan in places such as Grymes Hill, Staten Island; Sunset Park, Brooklyn; and Spencer Estates, the Bronx.And if you require natural light while making breakfast, take heart: Many of the kitchens came with windows. Most of the places were an improvement over their Manhattan counterparts in some way.Were the last of the Mohicans, said Charles Bludeau, a salesman with Douglas Elliman Real Estate who represents a two-bedroom condo on the water in Spencer Estates for $489,500. Where else can you even go?If a Brooklyn neighborhood has a hill in the name, as in Boerum or Cobble or Vinegar, it is fair to assume it may be pricey. A heights, as in Brooklyn Heights, is probably not the place to hunt for bargains, either.But finding an apartment for less than $500,000 that improves upon a similarly priced Manhattan studio does appear possible in neighborhoods like these, although the upgrade may be slight.For example, 111 Hicks Street, Apt. 15A, in Brooklyn Heights, which was offered late last month for $425,000 and has already drawn many interested buyers, does not on paper seem a big step up. Its a studio, and its price is steep for Brooklyn Heights. According to the Corcoran Group, the median price for a studio in the area that includes Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill, Dumbo and Downtown Brooklyn was $385,000 in the fourth quarter of last year.Then again, the 500-square-foot unit has an appealing layout, and the kitchen is not a wall of appliances. Its a separate, windowed room, which has, moreover, been renovated. The ceiling is beamed, and there is quite a bit of storage space. A better yardstick might be the one-bedroom median for the area, which was $549,000.And the yellow brick co-op building has a pedigree. Designed by Emery Roth and completed about 1929, it was once part of the massive Hotel St. George complex.The 30-story tower is not hemmed in by like-size structures, but looms over a low-slung neighborhood that is protected from development by a historic district. From Apt. 15A, views sweep south and east.What kept this $425,000 unit under the $500,000 mark was its relatively high maintenance fee of $1,005.95 a month, said Zelda Josephs of Zelda Josephs Real Estate, who is listing the unit, and who is a longtime resident of the co-op. The full-service building has an operating budget of about $5 million a year, according to the co-ops website.That maintenance bill may be about a couple hundred dollars higher than a typical studio in Brooklyn, but you wont find this in Manhattan, Ms. Josephs said. And if you found it in Manhattan, it would be way, way more.In the borough of Brooklyn in its entirety, the median sale price for a studio in the fourth quarter of 2015 was $426,000, according to Corcoran.But beyond the popular brownstone-lined neighborhoods close to Manhattan, brokers say, prices drop off, which means buyers who search slightly farther afield may be rewarded.For instance, Sunset Park, which is near Park Slope and has similar rowhouse architecture, though some of it is in rough shape, seems to offer deals. Late last month, 605 41st Street, Apt. Q, a two-bedroom, one-bath co-op, was for sale for $364,000.Buyers who like historic details may incline toward the unit, one of 20 in a walk-up brick building completed in about 1921 by Finnish developers who constructed several co-ops in the area. Geometric inlays enliven the floors in the 725-square-foot space. Wallpaper also adds vintage charm, though few would preserve the dated kitchen, which still has an ice box, cooled solely by the outside air, tucked into a wall.Buyers hoping to finance the purchase should look elsewhere. The co-op prohibits bank loans, an obstacle that partly explains the low price. Otherwise, this apartment could sell for about $550,000, said Paul Hyun, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman, who added that, Finns didnt believe in debt, and the building prefers to keep it this way.If cash deals offer opportunities for discounts, so does a lack of elevators, Mr. Hyun said. Had there been one in the building, which offers views of the Statue of Liberty, the price for this fourth-floor apartment might be a heftier $650,000, he said.Still, even if a buyer had to break the bank to land the unit, he or she would have a relatively easy time keeping current on the maintenance. Its just $311 a month.When thoughts turn to ownership, Manhattan residents might focus on apartments, but a house might offer smoother sailing in the other boroughs.The buyer of a house will encounter no persnickety co-op board to scrutinize his or her finances. Nor will house-buyers be subject to fees for condo-style amenities, like pet spas and tween rooms, that they would never use.In Grymes Hill, on the north shore of Staten Island near Wagner College, a three-bedroom Cape at 32 Cunard Place offers an amenity that might be more popular: an in-ground swimming pool in a small, neatly landscaped yard. Theres also an elevated, shaded patio from which to admire it.With a finished basement and driveway, the 1,300-square-foot house was listed last month for $479,000, though its rooms, some of which sport pink or mirrored walls, might be in line for a makeover. On the other hand, 32 Cunard received a new furnace and hot-water heater last year, so the buyer wont have to worry about that for a while.Buyers likely wont mistake quiet Grymes Hill for a trendsetting hood. People always say, Why cant we become like a Hoboken or Williamsburg, because we have a waterfront, too?  said Christopher J. Long, an associate broker with Gateway Arms Realty Corporation, referring to the north shore in general. But youve got to have the restaurants, the shopping, the bars, added Mr. Long, who has the listing for 32 Cunard, and who grew up in nearby West New Brighton and lives there today.Several neighborhoods on Staten Island are the site of major investments in new retail. Meanwhile, buyers are hopping on board the ferry. The median sale price of houses on Staten Island in January hit $438,000, surpassing the prerecession peak in May 2005 of $435,000, according to the Staten Island Board of Realtors, which also noted that inventory is the lowest it has been in a decade.What Im seeing now, said Mr. Long, who has been selling homes since 2000, is something Ive never seen before.To make your money go far, there may be no borough like the Bronx. Three hundred and ninety apartments and houses there were for sale for $500,000 or less on Feb. 26, according to StreetEasy, at a median list price of $215,500. And of that group, 18 listings could be picked up for less than $100,000.But StreetEasy and nytimes.com/findahome are heaviest in listings clustered in the northwestern Bronx, in the more expensive neighborhoods like Spuyten Duyvil and Riverdale. Instead, brokers say, consider the multiple listing service offered by the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, which casts a wider net. On Feb. 26, it generated 717 sub-$500,000 results.Spencer Estates, 12 miles from Midtown in the northeastern Bronx, where Mr. Bludeau has the listing for that two-bedroom $489,500 condo, may not register on the radar of many buyers. The condo itself is more than a mile from the nearest subway, so the units two dedicated parking spots may come in handy. On the bright side, the enclave faces Eastchester Bay and offers views of City Island and Long Island.Thick with modest stand-alone houses in brick, clapboard and vinyl from the mid-20th century, Spencer Estates is not postcard New York City. Mr. Bludeaus condo, at 1424 Outlook Avenue, Apt. 1, is part of the Outlook Point Condominiums, a gated 36-unit complex that opened in 2002 and could be at home in the suburbs.Besides a pair of bedrooms, the 1,022-square-foot apartment has one bath, five closets and views of a marina from the master bedroom. Waves lap on the rocky shore a few steps away from the ground-floor unit. For a monthly common charge of $379, an owner has use of laundry facilities and an on-site fitness center.Trend-spotters have not planted a flag here just yet. First, wide-scale development needs to happen in the Bronx, to correct decades of disinvestment, according to Mr. Bludeau. Only then will the existing housing stock get the attention it deserves, he said, hazarding a guess that moment is five years hence. That will be the time frame when it will really blow up, he said.Queens may be known for its stand-alone houses, but theyre hardly the only style of housing available. And the others tend to be lighter on the wallet.In late February, the borough had 239 co-op apartments for sale for $500,000 or less, according to a search of nytimes.com/findahome listings. Single-family houses? Just 93 in that price segment.And those co-ops, which started at $53,000, werent just found in urbanized Long Island City, but also in more suburban neighborhoods like Whitestone, Forest Hills and Bay Terrace. Jackson Heights, in central Queens, also packed them in, with 26.One of the Jackson Heights entries, 34-35 82nd Street, Apt. 21, a two-bedroom, one-bath apartment in a brick Beaux-Arts walk-up, could silence anybody who thinks Queens does not have pizazz.Listed at $488,000 with Teresa Reid, a saleswoman with Daniel Gale Sothebys International Realty, and now under contract, the second-floor apartment has nine-foot ceilings, hardwood floors and a nicely flowing 1,150-square-foot layout, plus numerous eye-catching details.Built-in bookshelves line the living room. Both granite and wood were deployed for kitchen counters. And the bath, redone in 2015, gleams in white tile.The five-story building, which opened in 1915 and went co-op four years later, lacks the leafy central garden of many larger prewar buildings in the area. But it does have a small courtyard.The sellers, William Bryant, an architect, and his wife, Joanne Liou, who manages construction projects, moved to Jackson Heights from the Upper West Side in 2006 in search of more space. The unit cost $337,000, near the peak of that market, and it required a major renovation.Though property values have clearly appreciated, Mr. Bryant, who is moving to Long Island, said it is curious how Jackson Heights, which regularly tops lists of best-value neighborhoods, still seems to be waiting for its moment. I guess theres still a perception that Queens is Queens, he said.But based on the enthusiastic turnout for a recent open house for the apartment, he believes progress is being made. The secret is out more than it was then, he said. But your money still goes a long way here."}
{"text": "HONG KONG   The search for the Malaysia Airlines jet that vanished almost two years ago has involved ships scanning thousands of square miles of the Indian Ocean seabed. But what could be the most promising development in months was the result of a lone mans search, one that took him to an uninhabited sandbank along the coast of Mozambique.Blaine Alan Gibsons discovery of a triangular piece of fiberglass composite and aluminum, if it is confirmed to be from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, could add to the scant concrete evidence of what happened to the Boeing 777. The plane, with 239 people aboard, disappeared on March 8, 2014, during a flight from Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, to Beijing.Like much of the world, Mr. Gibson, a lawyer from Seattle, said he had become intrigued by the fate of the plane while watching the intensive news coverage after its disappearance. He attended events in Kuala Lumpur marking the first anniversary of the flight, and after meeting with families of missing passengers, he decided to pursue his own investigation.Im intrigued by mysteries that need to be solved and am also touched by the families who have had two years with almost no answers at all, Mr. Gibson said by telephone from Bangkok, where he had flown en route to Kuala Lumpur for an event Sunday marking the second anniversary of the disappearance.I had some spare time and spare money, so I decided to travel to a few places to get an idea of what may have happened, he said.The quest has taken him to Myanmar, to look for debris in the Andaman Sea and examine local radar capabilities. He went to the Maldives to speak with people who claimed to have seen a low-flying plane on the day of the flight. He visited the French island of Runion, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, where the only confirmed debris from the plane to date, a part of an airplane wing called a flaperon, was found in July.Mr. Gibson, 58, said that his travels were part of a lifelong desire to visit all of the worlds countries, and that he tried to investigate mysteries along the way. He traveled to Russia in the early 1990s to investigate the so-called Tunguska event, in which a meteor is believed to have struck a Siberian forest in 1908. He has volunteered on archaeological projects in Belize and Guatemala to study the collapse of the Maya civilization. And he visited Ethiopia on a quest to find out what happened to the Ark of the Covenant.I was going to some monasteries and at the same time traveling in an interesting and beautiful country, he said of his Ethiopia trip. I love to travel, but I like to have some sort of reason. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 is another one of those.He joined a Facebook discussion group on the missing flight, which spurred his interest in researching its fate. He went to East Africa in February, after an Australian oceanographer told him that debris from the aircraft could eventually wash ashore in Mauritius, Madagascar and Mozambique. Mozambique became the 177th country he has visited, he said. After touring Maputo, the capital, he went to the beach town of Vilankulo, where he hired a boat to take him any place where debris from the open ocean washed ashore.On the morning of Feb. 27, he sailed with Suleman Valy, who is known as Junior and runs a local beach hotel and guide service, and a boat captain to a sandbar called Paluma.We landed on an island with, like, no vegetation and walked around, up and down, Mr. Gibson said. Most of the stuff there was just regular beach junk that I always see  plastic bottles, sandals, cigarette lighters. Suddenly Junior calls out.The piece they discovered, about a meter long, is fiberglass composite with honeycombed aluminum inside. The words No Step are written on one side. Investigators told NBC News, which first reported the discovery, that it could be from the horizontal stabilizer on the tail of the plane.Mr. Gibson returned to Maputo and handed over the object to the authorities there. Officials in Australia, which has been coordinating the Indian Ocean search, said it would be sent there for testing.Liow Tiong Lai, the Malaysian minister of transport, wrote on Twitter that based on early reports, there was a high possibility that the debris belonged to a Boeing 777, but he cautioned it had yet to be verified. Darren Chester, the Australian minister for infrastructure and transport, said in a statement that the location of the discovery is consistent with drift modeling commissioned by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau and reaffirms the search area in the Indian Ocean.Australia has been leading a search of about 46,000 square miles in the southern Indian Ocean, where transmissions between Flight 370 and a satellite indicate the plane crashed into the water, after veering off its initial course and flying south for hours. The search is expected to be finished by the middle of this year; if no more data is uncovered to suggest a new search area, the effort will be called off, officials have said. It has cost more than $100 million, with contributions from Australia, Malaysia and China. (Most of the passengers on the flight were Chinese.)Like the officials, Mr. Gibson expressed caution about concluding that the object he found is from Flight 370. The sooner it gets to Australia and they determine its one thing or another, the better, he said.As for his personal quest to discover what happened to the plane, he is still far from drawing a conclusion.I dont think theres sufficient evidence to support any theory, he said. I try to look at the evidence, try to find evidence rather than come up with a theory. And theres some crazy ones out there."}

I realized that the best place to present my next album would be inside a world I made for it.So last fall, he teamed up with fellow Angeleno Wendy Yao of Ooga Booga to produce a custom music-video studio by way of art exhibition, at Gavin Browns 356 Mission Road. The lead video, Eating Makeup, featuring the singular drone of Le Tigres Kathleen Hanna (whom Bogart, currently a fresh-faced 35, opened for at age 20 as the lone boy in the Bay Area quartet Gravy Train!!!!), uses a giant papier-mch makeup compact as a stand-in for the legendary Riot Grrrl. The monster jiggles its trap to the song and opens wide for the chorus to produce Bogart, channeling John Waters in a pink pleather suit and pencil mustache.While this menagerie of plasticky props screams Pee Wees Playhouse, as Bogart finally steps out, whats most distinctive about his look is how its maintained an authentically underground mystique.

{"text": "The story of Ben Abrahams burgeoning music career sounds like something out of a movie. The singer-songwriter, 30, was born in Melbourne to an Indonesian father and an Australian mother with a thinly veiled family secret: They had been Indonesian pop stars. I knew they were singers, but theyve always been a bit cagey about it, says Abraham, whose debut album, Sirens, was released in the U.S. last week. It wasnt until he was watching TV on a family trip to Indonesia in 2004, however, when a contestant on the show Indonesian Idol sang one of his parents songs that he learned that just how famous his parents had been. I was like, Hang on a second  how big were you guys? Despite growing up in what he describes as a very musical household, Abraham eschewed the family business as an 18-year-old in favor of five years of film school, turning to music only after a professor (a scary, kind of crotchety stalwart of the Australian writing scene) offered a particularly stinging critique of his work. He went through my script scene by scene, and at the end he sort of looked at me and went, Its just not very interesting, is it?That incident discouraged Abraham, but ultimately did little to extinguish what he calls the instinct in me to want to find the story. He followed his foray into screenwriting with a stint working at a Melbourne childrens hospital, where he was among 20 or so workers tasked with dressing in costume and engaging in distraction therapy with the residents. The point was to have no contact with the hospital environment or with medical stuff  to help kids be kids, Abraham says. He had yet to entertain the idea of a music career, but the hospital encouraged its staff to use what they called tools of engagement, so he picked up a guitar to use on his rounds. It was during one such visit, with a 13-year-old anorexia patient, that he discovered a knack for songwriting. I had started writing this song about my experiences at the hospital and some of the crazy things I had seen, and when I showed it to her, it was the first moment where we really connected. He encouraged the teenager to write a second verse  Luckily, she was really good at it, he says  and before long his bosses were flying him to fund-raisers around Australia to play the song and tell his story. Watching people around the country respond to that, that was kind of the ground-zero moment for me when I thought, I can do this, he says. That was the beginning of the end of my film career.The result of these collective experiences is Sirens, a debut of remarkable depth from a songwriter who tried to be anything but. Abrahams voice  shrewdly placed front and center in songs like I Belong to You and the Randy Newman-esque To Love Someone  evokes the plaintive purity of fellow Australian Gotye, who appears as a guest vocalist on the track Speak. And the straightforward yet cinematic songwriting, influenced by everyone from Cat Stevens and Joni Mitchell to the Spotlight screenwriter Tom McCarthy, has already won fans in established stars like Sara Bareilles and Emmylou Harris, who invited Abraham to open for her on an Australian tour in 2012. I sort of look at it and go, Wow, this is a product of a time that Im no longer in, Abraham says, noting that the albums 13 tracks were written over a period of eight years. When I play these songs, I feel like Im telling a story that has an ending."}
{"text": "Richard Socher appeared nervous as he waited for his artificial intelligence program to answer a simple question: Is the tennis player wearing a cap?The word processing lingered on his laptops display for what felt like an eternity. Then the program offered the answer a human might have given instantly: Yes.Mr. Socher, who clenched his fist to celebrate his small victory, is the founder of one of a torrent of Silicon Valley start-ups intent on pushing variations of a new generation of pattern recognition software, which, when combined with increasingly vast sets of data, is revitalizing the field of artificial intelligence.His company MetaMind, which is in crowded offices just off the Stanford University campus in Palo Alto, Calif., was founded in 2014 with $8 million in financial backing from Marc Benioff, chief executive of the business software company Salesforce, and the venture capitalist Vinod Khosla.MetaMind is now focusing on one of the most daunting challenges facing A.I. software. Computers are already on their way to identifying objects in digital images or converting sounds uttered by human voices into natural language. But the field of artificial intelligence has largely stumbled in giving computers the ability to reason in ways that mimic human thought.Now a variety of machine intelligence software approaches known as deep learning or deep neural nets are taking baby steps toward solving problems like a human.On Sunday, MetaMind published a paper describing advances its researchers have made in creating software capable of answering questions about the contents of both textual documents and digital images.The new research is intriguing because it indicates that steady progress is being made toward conversational agents that can interact with humans. The MetaMind results also underscore how far researchers have to go to match human capabilities.Other groups have previously made progress on discrete problems, but generalized systems that approach human levels of understanding and reasoning have not been developed.Five years ago, IBMs Watson system demonstrated that it was possible to outperform humans on Jeopardy!Last year, Microsoft developed a chatbot program known as Xiaoice (pronounced Shao-ice) that is designed to engage humans in extended conversation on a diverse set of general topics.To add to Xiaoices ability to offer realistic replies, the company developed a huge library of human question-and-answer interactions mined from social media sites in China. This made it possible for the program to respond convincingly to typed questions or statements from users.In 2014, computer scientists at Google, Stanford and other research groups made significant advances in what is described as scene understanding, the ability to understand and describe a scene or picture in natural language, by combining the output of different types of deep neural net programs.These programs were trained on images that humans had previously described. The approach made it possible for the software to examine a new image and describe it with a natural-language sentence.While even machine vision is not yet a solved problem, steady, if incremental, progress continues to be made by start-ups like Mr. Sochers; giant technology companies such as Facebook, Microsoft and Google; and dozens of research groups.In their recent paper, the MetaMind researchers argue that the companys approach, known as a dynamic memory network, holds out the possibility of simultaneously processing inputs including sound, sight and text.The design of MetaMind software is evidence that neural network software technologies are becoming more sophisticated, in this case by adding the ability both to remember a sequence of statements and to focus on portions of an image. For example, a question like What is the pattern on the cats fur on its tail? might yield the answer stripes and show that the program had focused only on the cats tail to arrive at its answer.Another step toward really understanding images is, are you actually able to answer questions that have a right or wrong answer? Mr. Socher said.MetaMind is using the technology for commercial applications like automated customer support, he said. For example, insurance companies have asked if the MetaMind technology could respond to an email with an attached photo  perhaps of damage to a car or other property  he said.There is still significant debate within the research community about the best technical approach and even what is the best way to measure progress.We are excited to see them joining the fray in question answering, but we think the data sets they chose are not ideal, said Oren Etzioni, a computer scientist who is chief executive of the Allen  Institute for Artificial Intelligence, in Seattle.In contrast, his laboratory is focusing on creating software that can answer questions taken from standardized elementary school science tests."}
{"text": "Earle Mack, a Brooklyn-born businessman and former ambassador under President George W. Bush, is the major force behind a super PAC that is attempting to draft the Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and speaker of the House, as the partys presidential nominee.Mr. Mack said in an interview that he would spend up to $1 million on The Committee to Draft Speaker Ryan, which was formed last week, but has kept its backers secret until now. Mr. Ryan has disavowed the group, which is plowing ahead anyway.Mr. Mack will serve as the honorary chairman of the group. He said he had no animus toward Donald J. Trump, the  front-runner for the partys nomination.Ive never had any fights with him, Mr. Mack said. Our parents were friendly. Fred Trump used my fathers contractors to build his house. But he added, It all comes down to winning the election, not dividing our party, and I think that this presidential election has descended into more of a schoolyard scuffle.Mr. Mack, who was the ambassador to Finland, said he believed the tone of the campaign had touched them all with the finger of pollution.  Winning a general election would be a struggle for all of the candidates after so much mud has been flung, he added. Mr. Mack said that Mr. Ryan was not aware of the effort while the group was being put into place.The push is expected to include digital ads and other measures. The groups chairman and senior adviser is Rob Cole, who was the top adviser to the presidential campaign of George E. Pataki, the former governor of New York. Susan Del Percio, a Republican strategist in New York, will be another senior adviser. David Catalfamo, a former spokesman for Mr. Pataki, is also working with the group.Mr. Ryan, the partys vice-presidential nominee in 2012, has been a favorite of conservative opinion makers for years, and last week he criticized Mr. Trump, indirectly, for some of his caustic comments. But Mr. Ryan is not warm to the idea of a group drafting him to be his partys standard-bearer.A lawyer representing Mr. Ryan sent a letter to the Federal Election Commission on Friday disavowing the draft effort. It is the Speakers sincere hope that donors and supporters are not confused by, or misled into supporting, this organization, the letter said.For now, the only person funding the group is Mr. Mack, who has set himself a target of that first $1 million.Then well see where we go from there, he said."}
{"text": "BRUSSELS   The day before a European conference designed to persuade Turkey to curb the uncontrolled flow of migrants making perilous journeys across the Aegean Sea, NATO announced on Sunday that it would expand its maritime efforts to stop the smugglers who make many of those journeys possible.More than one million migrants arrived in Europe last year, and the prospect of another large influx threatens to overwhelm Greece and destroy a policy of open borders across much of the Continent.The dangers faced by migrants who take sea routes to Greece were underscored again on Sunday when at least 18 people drowned off the Turkish coast, according to news reports. More than 300 migrants have already died this year making similar journeys on that route.As part of efforts to quell the mounting crisis, Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of NATO, said Sunday that ships used by the alliance would begin conducting operations in the territorial waters of Greece and Turkey after close consultation and coordination with the two countries.NATOs patrols in the Aegean would focus on collecting information and conducting monitoring, Mr. Stoltenberg said. The idea, he added, is to share information in real time, including between Greece and Turkey, and to enable them and Frontex, the European Unions border agency, to take action in real time against the smuggling rackets. He did not offer specific examples of how smugglers might be stopped.Last month, Mr. Stoltenberg said NATO forces would not turn back the boats. But, he added, if NATO vessels did encounter people in distress at sea, the crews would live up to their responsibility to assist.European Union leaders, such as Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, want to persuade Turkey to reduce the number of migrants leaving its shores and to take back large numbers of people who have already crossed the Aegean but are not eligible for political asylum in Europe.In exchange, European countries would offer to directly resettle a large number of refugees living in camps in Turkey who have fled the violence in Syria. In addition, the European Union could eventually add to the $3.3 billion it pledged to Turkish aid organizations in November. That money was intended to help manage millions of refugees and migrants in Turkey.European Union leaders had raised hopes that such a trade-off with the Turkish prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, could be negotiated at the meeting in Brussels on Monday. They have said, however, that it remains too early for an agreement on the number of people who would be transferred from Europe back to Turkey.Another factor that could impede progress at the meeting is a ruling by a Turkish court ordering the seizure of the opposition Zaman newspaper.That move has prompted sharp criticism from some European Union parliamentarians who say Europe relies too heavily on Turkey to ease the migration crisis. They say it should instead make a unified effort to help Greece and create an effective coast guard to protect the blocs coastlines.In Greece, a nation still grappling with severe economic problems, many thousands of migrants have become trapped because Macedonia, which is not a member of the European Union, has blocked their passage northward.On Sunday, Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats group in the European Parliament, said Turkey had so far given little more than empty promises on returning migrants. He also warned against making a deal with a country that imprisons journalists, attacks civil liberties and with a highly worrying human rights situation.As Europe continues to dither over the worst crisis of its kind since the Second World War, the announcement that NATO would expand its operations could, at least, give leaders more time to reach a more united position and wring more concessions from Turkey.Beefing up the NATO mission in the Aegean is going to help European leaders like Ms. Merkel claim that theres progress bringing the situation under control, said Mujtaba Rahman, the Europe director for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.But NATO is not the answer, so that means this really is about buying yet more time to reach some kind of solution where Turkey shows a willingness to keep refugees from leaving its shores in the first place, Mr. Rahman said."}
{"text": "It may not strike everyone as the loftiest ambition: creating machines that are smarter than people. Not setting the bar terribly high, is it? So the more cynical might say. All the same, an array of scientists and futurists are convinced that the advent of devices with superhuman intelligence looms in the not-distant future. The prospect fills some of our planets brainiest specimens with dread.They include certified smart men like Bill Gates of Microsoft, the physicist Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, head of SpaceX. Messrs. Hawking and Musk have been especially grim. The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race, Mr. Hawking told the BBC in 2014. At about the same time, Mr. Musk worried that with artificial intelligence, we are summoning the demon, a fiend that he feared would become our biggest existential threat.When people of their caliber speak, it seems reasonable to listen. And so, alarms about a computer-spawned apocalypse are a backdrop to the latest installment in the Retro Report series, video documentaries that explore major news events of the past and their continuing effects.Men of science are not alone in the hand-wringing over the possibility of machines running wild. Asked what they feared most, Americans interviewed by researchers at Chapman University in Southern California ranked the consequences of modern technology near the top. Even death did not rattle them as much; it was way down on their list of worries, at No. 43.While not discounting that doomsayers may prove someday to be right, Retro Report offers more reassuring views from computer specialists who sense that the end is not nigh  if only, they say, because machines are not nearly as clever, or necessarily as pernicious, as the fretters believe.Jitters over humanitys falling victim to various creations are as old Mary Shelleys Frankenstein monster and the Golem of Jewish tradition. Hostile robots have been on the scene since at least the 1920s with the play R.U.R., by the Czech writer Karel Capek. The initials stood for Rossums Universal Robots. Indeed, this work introduced robot into the language. Since then, run-amok machines have been a science-fiction staple in books and films like Colossus: The Forbin Project, I, Robot, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Transcendence, Ex Machina and the seemingly inexhaustible supply of Terminator movies. One sure bet about those films is that, like the Terminator itself, theyll be back.On occasion, machines are cast as a benign presence, as in the 2013 film Her, in which a man finds intimacy with an operating system that is guided by artificial intelligence (not to mention made alluring by the voice of Scarlett Johansson). In Japan, some people have closely bonded with robot dogs, to the point of holding funerals for automated pooches that cease to function.More typically, though, the machines  robots, cyborgs, androids, clones  are depicted as threats to human survival. As Retro Report recalls, fear of them in real life grew in 1997 when a chess-playing IBM computer, Deep Blue, defeated the world champion, Garry Kasparov. Apprehension deepened for some in 2011 when two stars of the quiz show Jeopardy! were soundly defeated by a new IBM gizmo. (What is Watson?) This week, artificial intelligence will again challenge the human brain as Googles DeepMind competes in South Korea against a champion in Go, the Chinese board game with trillions of possible moves.Arguably, there is no reason to lose sleep over those souped-up gadgets. Sure, Watson and its brethren are good at games and other sorts of data processing. But contemplating a takeover of the worlds nuclear arsenals? Not a chance. Nonetheless, some experts foresee a time, not far off, when artificial intelligence, A.I., will match and then exceed human intelligence, at ever-accelerating and frightening speeds.Shortly after, the human era will be ended, Vernor Vinge, a computer scientist and science fiction author, wrote in 1993. That moment, he predicted, would come within 30 years. In other words, check your calendars  a mere seven years remain until the arrival of this technological singularity, as it was called.Another A.I. expert, Raymond Kurzweil, has pinpointed 2045 as the due date. Still another student of the subject, James Barrat, also says that once the machines blow past us, mans reign is through.We humans steer the future not because were the strongest beings on the planet, or the fastest, but because we are the smartest, Mr. Barrat has said. So when there is something smarter than us on the planet, it will rule over us on the planet.Horrific scenarios abound. Superintelligent computers will cause global financial systems to collapse. They will wage war on humans with killer robots far more lethal than todays drones. They will control nuclear weaponry  think Skynet in the Terminator series  to dominate humankind or, worse, wipe it out.In these grim predictions, the machines always seem to be anthropomorphic: Their instincts are essentially the same as those of humans at their worst; just as people have run roughshod over lower life forms, artificial intelligence networks will abuse their supremacy. Possibilities for them to do good  figuring out how to regenerate human cells, for instance, or creating immunities against disease, or gobbling up carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  tend to get short shrift.For some analysts, any worry about human survival is theoretical and certainly less immediate than more prosaic, yet vital, concerns. Technological advances have enhanced the ability of governments to spy on their citizens. How to shape policy is now reflected in the struggle between Apple and the Obama administration over access to the iPhone of one of the terrorists in the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., in December.Economic issues are unavoidable as well. Lawrence H. Summers, president emeritus at Harvard University and a former Treasury secretary, noted that unemployment is disproportionately higher among those whose duties in various ways have been mechanized. There are important consequences for the way the economy is organized and for how fair the economy is, Mr. Summers said in an interview with Retro Report.There is, too, a question of how smart robots truly are and whether they can develop superintelligence at the blinding speed envisioned by the more pessimistic forecasters. Things that are easy for humans are hard for computers, Guruduth S. Banavar, the director of cognitive computing research at IBM, told Retro Report, and things that are easy for computers are hard for humans. Yes, a computer can multiply two numbers of 1,000 digits each in a matter of seconds. But it cannot hold a candle to a toddler when it comes to recognizing faces or performing a task as simple as climbing steps.Perhaps it is human nature to assume the worst with something new. Humans often converge around massive technological shifts  around any change, really  with a flurry of anxieties, Adrienne LaFrance, who covers technology for The Atlantic magazine, wrote a year ago.But it is too soon for hyperventilating, Fei-Fei Li, a professor of computer science at Stanford University, told Retro Report. With A.I., she said, we are closer to a washing machine than a Terminator."}

If Bill Clinton felt raked over the coals during the Democratic debate on Sunday night, he didnt seem sore about it on his three-city swing through North Carolina on Monday.Mr. Clinton was  disciplined as he stuck to his notes on his lecterns  a list of Hillary Clintons policy ideas and several examples of her as a change-maker  rather than defend the 1994 crime bill, the 1996 welfare reform law, the North American Free Trade Agreement, financial deregulation and other hallmarks of his tenure that were challenged and criticized at the debate. Most of those attacks came from Senator Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clintons rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, but even Mrs. Clinton expressed concerns about how parts of her husbands legacy turned out.Mr. Clinton, who has been known to go off script and give detailed history lessons about his presidency, kept the focus largely on his wife.I hope youll vote for her because shes the single best change-maker Ive ever known, Mr. Clinton said, a signature line that he used in Raleigh, Greensboro and here before a predominantly African-American crowd at Johnson C. Smith University.His talking points included some charged shots at Mr. Sanders, but nothing on par with the Vermont senators rebukes of the Clinton era of the 1990s. Mr. Clinton did talk about some of the successes of the 90s, such as the rise in African-American median income.But mostly he explained why he thought Mrs. Clinton was the only candidate qualified to be both commander in chief and the leader on major domestic policy changes, and he derided the Republican candidates for not talking about substance as much as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders were.Our friends in the Republican Party look like theyre having a sixth-grade food fight, Mr. Clinton said here. North Carolinas primary is next Tuesday, although the early voting is now underway.Mr. Clinton has been known to lash out at opponents when they heap scorn on Mrs. Clinton or describe his presidency in ways he would not.But some allies of the couple said on Monday that the former president thought Mrs. Clinton did a good job at the debate of defending his legacy and explaining unintended problems with the welfare bill, which he himself has discussed in the past. He didnt see a particular need to pounce on Mr. Sanders, they said, especially when Mrs. Clinton has built such a commanding lead over Mr. Sanders in the so-called pledged delegates needed to win the nomination.\nFind out what you need to know about the 2016 presidential race today, and get politics news updates via Facebook, Twitter and the First Draft newsletter."}
{"text": "CLEARWATER, Fla.   On Sunday, for the first time since the wild-card playoff game against the Houston Astros, Masahiro Tanaka pitched in a game.There was no great anxiety about it beforehand, but it was still noteworthy that Tanaka made it safely through two innings of his spring training debut against the Philadelphia Phillies without any physical limitations. That leaves him on pace to start on opening day for the Yankees.That is the goal, he said through an interpreter. That is what I am trying to do.Shortly after that Oct. 6 playoff loss to the Astros, Tanaka had surgery to remove a bone spur in his right elbow. The spur did not cause Tanaka to miss any starts. He said it had not bothered him on days he pitched, only between starts.But for a second straight season, Tanaka had to pitch around arm injuries. A wrist and forearm strain caused him to miss all of May, and he made only 24 starts. The previous season, his rookie campaign, Tanaka was found to have a small tear in his ulnar collateral ligament, and he made just 20 starts.The hope, of course, is that he will not only survive the entire coming season free of injuries but also pitch to the level he did in the first half of 2014, before the first elbow injury surfaced.Yes, I do feel that I can get back to that form, he said after his outing against the Phillies, because it feels better.Pitching to catcher Gary Sanchez, Tanaka threw two scoreless innings. He allowed two hits and a walk and struck out two batters. Most important, he reported no problems with his elbow, either during the game, a 6-5 Phillies win, or at any point during spring training.Manager Joe Girardi said Tanaka was on schedule to start opening day against the Astros, in what is likely to be a rematch of the wild-card face-off between Tanaka and Dallas Keuchel.The idea is that he is our No. 1 starter, Girardi said, but you have to see how he does physically.Tanaka was assisted in the game by Rob Refsnyder, who made his debut of sorts at third base. With runners on first and second and nobody out in the first inning, Refsnyder dived to his left to snare a sharp ground ball off the bat of Carlos Ruiz. He scrambled to his feet and fired a strike to Starlin Castro, who relayed to Dustin Ackley to complete the double play.He got the good part of the bat, and the ball had a lot of velocity, Tanaka said of the ball Ruiz hit. It was huge that he made that play.In his brief professional career, Refsnyder has been moved from right field to second base, where Castro is set to be the starter. Now Refsnyder is being asked to try third base. If he can show proficiency there, he stands a chance of making the roster as a backup infielder.Refsnyder began working at third base about a week ago and said he had split his time evenly between second and third in practices.Im just trying to do my best and help the team in any way I can, he said.Refsnyder also performed well offensively, with a hit and a walk in two plate appearances. He stole two bases and scored a run.Sanchez, another young player given a chance to start, did well behind the plate. He left the game in the sixth inning after being hit in the leg by a pitch by the submarine thrower Greg Burke, but he said he felt fine.Austin Romine, who is also competing for the backup catching job, replaced Sanchez and went 2 for 2 with two doubles and three R.B.I.Sanchez, 23, who is from the Dominican Republic, is one of the top prospects in the Yankees organization. He is competing for a spot as the backup to Brian McCann and is considered the catcher of the future. The Yankees must weigh the benefits of having him sit and learn behind McCann against giving him a chance to play every day in Class AAA.Im excited to be in the mix, Sanchez said through an interpreter. But for us players who want to make it to the big leagues, it is not our decision.As for catching Tanaka, Sanchez said he was pleased with how the two innings had proceeded.We were on the same page, he said."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Your Cure (news analysis, Sunday Review, Feb. 28):Elisabeth Rosenthal is correct in criticizing the use of expensive drugs that are similar to and usually no better than less expensive or much, much less expensive alternatives, but she doesnt note the primary villain. It is a physician who writes the prescription. Patients do not go to the pharmacy and order the medication.An endocrinologist should know to say, That new diabetes pill is O.K. but costs $600 a month, and a number of generics do about the same job. A podiatrist should say, Those drops to put on your toenail fungus cost $400 a month and cure less than 20 percent, while a generic toenail polish has about the same results and costs $10 a month.Physicians are too often obtuse about the cost of what they are prescribing, especially since they just had a nice dinner at the best local restaurant courtesy of the very same drug company, or they dont want to spend time defending the equal benefits of the generic.Patients may not like their TV-induced knowledge being questioned, and physicians may have to learn a little more and defend their actions with a brief talk (and even a reference to Internet use for more information). Physicians are not practicing good medicine if they cannot deal with misinformation in pharmaceutical advertising.LONNIE HANAUERWest Orange, N.J.The writer is a rheumatologist.To the Editor:Elisabeth Rosenthal raises important questions about advertising by private hospitals and drug companies and the mass manipulation of patients. All these should be rightly placed in their proper arena, as growing public health concerns. The mix of greed and the facade of medical legitimacy have congealed in the form of avaricious health care advertising campaigns.In our political climate, as Republicans promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and as Democrats debate the merits of a single-payer system versus an expanded version of Obamacare, it is discomforting to see that Big Pharma is keeping its watchful eye on the proverbial ball: manipulate public opinion, misinform patients about alternatives, drive up prices and privatize well-being through fear.Its been a winning formula so far. How about just being honest with people about options in their most vulnerable of times, when they are ill?TALIA LUSTIGER-THALERBrooklynTo the Editor:Does it escape notice that these ads have the same characteristic attributes  rapidly spoken disclaimers and unreadable fine print  as used car ads do?Why are members of the medical profession not profoundly ashamed that they have allowed this second-rate hucksterism to dominate the media? Money, of course.Medicine was a profession; now its a business. May the new generation coming into medicine lead it back to higher ground.THOMAS H. WRIGHTVieques, P.R.To the Editor:We greatly enjoy the drug ads. Amid the chaos and violence of TV, these ads are often lovely visuals of couples walking on the beach, boating on the lake, exploring the village arts fair and other pleasant idylls.Of course, we have no idea what medication is being touted. Our TV remote control has this mute button. We recommend its use for fast relief from chronic A.T.C.

{"text": "While pundits differed on who scored what points in Sundays Democratic debate, all agree that the discourse was substantive and policy-focused, a refreshing change from Republican exchanges, which lately have focused more on insults about hand size than about ideas.Still, there were signs onSunday of how quickly things could devolve. Hillary Clinton seems increasingly weary of having Bernie Sanders around, calling her out on her fealty to Wall Street and demanding she release the transcripts of her paid industry speeches. Mrs. Clintons desire to land a knock-out punch was most clear after an exchange the Clinton team is trying to spin into a game-changing affront by Mr. Sanders.Heres the exchange, which came after Mrs. Clinton wrongly accused Mr. Sanders of voting against the 2008 auto industry bailout.SANDERS: Well, I  If you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economyCLINTON: You knowSANDERS:  through  excuse me, Im talking.COOPER: Let him (inaudible).(APPLAUSE)(CROSSTALK)CLINTON: If youre gonna talk, tell the whole story, Senator Sanders.SANDERS: Let me tell my story. You tell yours.CLINTON: I will.SANDERS: Your story is for  voting for every disastrous trade agreement, and voting for corporate America. Did I vote against the Wall Street bailout?When billionaires on Wall Street destroyed this economy, they went to Congress and they said, please, well be good boys, bail us out. You know what I said? I said, let the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street. It shouldnt be the middle class of this country.(APPLAUSE)From the transcript, its clear that Anderson Cooper, the moderator, was also trying to stop Mrs. Clinton from interrupting Mr. Sanderss response to her charge. But Mr. Sanders was visibly angry, and afterward, some compared his response to a debate exchange in 2000, when Mrs. Clinton was running for Senate against Representative Rick Lazio of New York. Mr. Lazio approached Mrs. Clintons podium with a sheet of paper that he said was a pledge to abstain from using unregulated campaign contributions in the race, and demanded she sign it. She declined, and later her surrogates accused Mr. Lazio of sexist bullying.The exchange on Sunday nightwas not a Lazio moment but a Rorschach test. Clinton supporters see it as a disrespectful, even sexist dismissal of their candidate; Sanders backers view it as a made-up distraction, arguing that Mrs. Clintons talent for strategic filibustering means Mr. Sanders must be aggressive in seizing equal time on national TV.On Monday came signs of more silliness, as the Clinton campaign worked to draw attention to tweets by the National Rifle Association agreeing with Mr. Sanderss comment in the debate that holding gun manufacturers legally liable for gun violence would end gun manufacturing in the United States. The truth is, neither Democrat gets high marks from the N.R.A.The longer this two-person primary stretches on, the less daylight shows between the two candidates, as Mrs. Clinton shifts left in her effort to woo Mr. Sanderss base. But daylight does exist, and its on both candidates to shed light on these policy differences, and avoid the petty attacks that have come to characterize the Republican primary debates. Its good for the Democratic Party, and for the process, to have a real battle  as long as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders stick to the high road."}
{"text": "The Senate returns on Monday to resume work on legislation to combat the nations growing opioid epidemic, but there are continued signs that the bipartisan bill is getting caught in the increasing nastiness surrounding the Supreme Court fight.On Thursday, with tempers flaring, the Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, objected to plans by the majority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, to debate amendments to the bill, forcing Mr. McConnell to initiate procedural steps to overcome a filibuster. Until now, the bill has enjoyed bipartisan support, and it is still likely to win passage.But the deepening acrimony over the Republicans insistence that they will not consider any Supreme Court nominee put forward by President Obama is now dominating much of the discussion on the Senate floor.Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, who is a chief author of the antidrug legislation and keen to keep it in a path to approval, invoked on Sunday the memory of Nancy Reagan, the former first lady, as inspiration for getting it done.I would like to acknowledge her significant contributions in the struggle to end drug abuse and addiction, Mr. Portman said on Sunday as part of a statement honoring her life. She was a true leader on this issue, and I have no doubt that her focus on education and prevention, as well as treatment and recovery, helped save many Americans from the disease of addiction.Mr. Portman was hardly the only Republican to note Mrs. Reagans push against drug addiction.Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, said in a statement on Sunday: I often think it is too little appreciated that her historic leadership inspired millions of good citizens to rise up and take action to stop the catastrophic surging rate of drug abuse and addiction. It is a fact that her Just say no initiative which spread all over the nation was the key to the effort. Many scoffed, but after sustained efforts drug use started downward to levels that were half what they were when she started.Mr. Sessions added, It is good to remember this work and strive not to let an increasing drug cycle begin again.As the Senate continues work on the antidrug bill, the House will meet only in pro forma session, allowing most representatives to be home gearing up for the November elections."}
{"text": "Al Wistert, a star tackle for Philadelphia Eagles teams that won two consecutive N.F.L. championship games by shutouts in the late 1940s and the last survivor of the three Wistert brothers inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, died on Thursday in Grants Pass, Ore. He was 95.His death was confirmed by his daughter Kathryn Wistert.Wistert was often outweighed by the man across the line of scrimmage in his nine N.F.L. seasons, all with the Eagles. But he was not known as Ox for nothing. He mowed down opponents on both offense and defense and covered punts and kickoffs as well.He was named a first-team All-Pro six times by major national news agencies and was considered one of the finest players to miss out on election to the Pro Football Hall in Canton, Ohio.Al Wistert and his brothers Francis, known as Whitey, and Alvin were all-American tackles at the University of Michigan, which has retired the No. 11 worn by each of them.Al was a modest 6 feet 1 inches and weighed about 215 pounds, but his blocks sprang the Eagles future Hall of Fame running back Steve Van Buren on long gains, and he was tenacious and mobile on defense.Wisterts Eagles, coached by Earle Neale, known as Greasy, went to three straight N.F.L. championship games. They were beaten by the Chicago Cardinals, 28-21, in 1947 at Comiskey Park, then defeated the Cardinals, 7-0, in a snowstorm at Philadelphias Shibe Park the following year and repeated as champions with a 14-0 triumph over the Rams on a muddy Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum field. The 1948 and 49 Eagles teams are the only N.F.L. squads to have won consecutive league championships by shutouts.We wanted to get those shutouts because whenever we shut out an opponent, wed get a free dinner at Old Bookbinders, Wistert told The Bucks County Courier Times in 2008, referring to the Philadelphia seafood restaurant Old Original Bookbinders.In a 1993 letter to the board of selectors of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, George Savitsky, an Eagles tackle on their 1948 and 49 championship teams after an all-American career at Penn, wrote, as related in Ray Didinger and Robert S. Lyonss The Eagles Encyclopedia (2005), that Wistert should have been inducted many years ago.How could he be overlooked? Savitsky wondered.The Hall of Fame coach George Allen rated Wistert one of the top 10 defensive linemen in Pro Footballs 100 Greatest Players (1982).Albert Alexander Wistert was born on Dec. 28, 1920, in Chicago, a son of Lithuanian immigrants. When he was young, his father, Kazimer, a Chicago police sergeant, died of complications of wounds sustained when he was shot during a holdup.Als brother Francis played tackle on two unbeaten Michigan teams in the early 1930s. Al starred at Michigan from 1940 to 1942. His brother Alvin made his Michigan debut at age 31 after service with the Marines in World War II and played for undefeated Wolverine teams in 1947 and 48.Al Wistert, the only Wistert brother to play in the N.F.L., was selected by the Eagles in the fifth round of the 1943 draft, but spent his rookie season with a hybrid team known as the Steagles, essentially an Eagles team with some players from the Pittsburgh Steelers, both having lost many athletes to military service.Deferred from the World War II military because of a bone ailment, Al Wistert developed an innovative form of blocking, ramming a defender with his shoulder, then heading downfield looking for another victim to level instead of being satisfied, like most linemen, with one cross block that would leave him on the ground as the play went on.The Eagles retired Wisterts No. 70 in 1952, the first time they had accorded that honor to a former player.Wistert left pro football after the 1951 season. He later coached high school football in New Jersey and sold insurance before retiring in Oregon.In addition to his daughter Kathryn, he is survived by his daughters Pamela Avila and Dianna Rorabacher, three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. His wife, Ellie, died in 2004.When the Eagles defeated the Rams in the 1949 N.F.L. championship game, the teams management threw a victory banquet at the Bel-Air Country Club in Los Angeles. But the players rewards did not include championship rings.As Wistert told it in Gordon Forbess Tales From the Eagles Sidelines (2002): They gave us these Zippo cigarette lighters. They didnt even have our names on them or anything else about the championship. I left mine at the table."}
{"text": "Insurers and employers are eager to have workers explore new ways of getting care, like visiting a clinic at a drugstore when they have a sore throat. The care they receive not only is more convenient, but also costs much less than a visit to the emergency room or a doctors office.But a new study published on Monday in Health Affairs, a policy journal, casts fresh doubt on whether these popular retail clinics will save money. Researchers concluded that the clinics led to slightly higher spending because people used them for minor medical conditions they would typically have treated on their own.The higher use, researchers said, outweighed the savings that resulted when people went to a cheaper retail clinic instead of to the doctor or emergency room.The study looked at insurance claims data from Aetna, a large health insurer, for minor conditions. The researchers calculated that 58 percent of retail clinic visits were for services that they would not have otherwise sought, resulting in a net increase in spending of $14 per person per year.Convenience has an Achilles heel, said Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, the studys senior author, who is an associate professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School and a researcher at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research group.Executives at retail clinics say the study was flawed and failed to demonstrate the overall savings the clinics achieve. The studys authors acknowledge that the study did not offer conclusions about whether the visits to the clinics prevented hospital stays or reduced the need for a prescription, a goal for policy analysts that has the potential of reducing overall health spending.The study does not take into account the role the clinics play in treating people early, said Dr. Andrew Sussman, president of MinuteClinic, the retail clinics operated by CVS Health, the drugstore chain. These patients are not going to get better on their own, he said, and a clinic visit can prevent a very expensive hospital stay.Dr. Sussman pointed to his published research, looking at CVSs employees and evaluating their use of retail clinics, that showed overall savings, including fewer hospitalizations.Still, the findings raise serious questions about whether new sources of care like clinics or telemedicine, in which medical advice is offered over the phone, will be able to save money. People may find it much easier to pick up the phone or go to a drugstore without an appointment to have a minor ailment checked.There are some 2,000 clinics across the country, according to the researchers, accounting for more than six million visits a year. The clinics are distinct from urgent care centers, which tend to offer more sophisticated tests and treat more complex conditions.In general, people go to retail clinics for simple conditions. A child may be running a high fever or someone with a bad sore throat may want to rule out something more serious.Aetna, which did not fund the study but provided the insurance claims for it, says retail clinics provide a useful service. Retail clinics are a convenient and flexible option that are available during extended hours, while traveling, and for minor health needs, Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for Aetna, said in a statement. They are also a good option for consumers who do not have a primary care physician, and a far better setting for care than an emergency room.The question of whether the centers may reduce costs by improving care for people with chronic conditions like diabetes and asthma remains unanswered, she noted, and more analysis needs to be done to determine whether they save money in other ways.Much of the care provided by MinuteClinic is preventive services like vaccines, said Dr. Sussman, who said the clinics were also a resource for people who did not have a regular doctor.Retail clinics may also serve an important function by forcing doctors and hospitals to respond with lower prices and expanded hours if they want to retain patients, said Martin Gaynor, a health economist at Carnegie Mellon University who is also one of the studys authors.But convenience may still have a price, Dr. Mehrotra said. All of those things are going to increase utilization, he said. The question, he said, is Are we getting the worried well or the sick?"}
{"text": "PHOENIX   Two towns run by the polygamist sect controlled by Warren Jeffs routinely violated the civil rights of nonbelievers by discriminating against them in housing permits, policing and utilities hookups, a Federal District Court jury here found Monday.Prosecutors had argued that the two towns  Colorado City, Ariz., and neighboring Hildale, Utah  effectively did the bidding of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the largest polygamist sect in the United States. They asserted that the towns denied basic services to outsiders, essentially creating a two-tiered system.Federal prosecutors did not specify the remedies they would seek, which could include disbanding the towns police force and placing the towns administration into the hands of county or state officials.The trial was one of two actions the authorities have taken recently against the sect. During the final days of the trial, federal agents raided businesses in Hildale and arrested 11 sect leaders and their associates, accusing them of siphoning millions of dollars in food-stamp transactions to bank accounts managed by the sect. Among those arrested was Lyle Jeffs, the brother and surrogate for Warren Jeffs, who is serving a life sentence for the sexual abuse of under-age girls he claimed as his wives.Before the jury deliberations commenced last week, Judge H. Russel Holland told jurors that prosecutors must prove that religion was a motivating factor behind the actions by the towns governments and shared police force.The defense maintained that the towns actions were sporadic and wholly unrelated to religion. Throughout the trial, lawyers representing Colorado City and Hildale tapped into jurors perceived feelings about freedom of religion and the outsize role of government in their lives, explicitly casting their decision as an opportunity to fortify those boundaries.During his closing statement here on Wednesday, Jeff Matura, who represents Colorado City, told the jury, Youre the only ones who can tell the federal government no, its not O.K. in these United States of America to prosecute individuals because of their religious beliefs.Sean Keveney, a lawyer for the Justice Departments civil rights division, zeroed in on letters from police and elected officials to Warren Jeffs."}
{"text": "Q. Whats the No. 1 cause of blindness in older adults in the United States?A. It sounds like a simple question, but theres no perfect answer, said Dr. Susan Vitale, a research epidemiologist at the National Eye Institute of the National Institutes of Health. It depends on age, how blindness is measured and how statistics are collected. For example, some studies have relied on the self-reported answer to the vague question: Do you have vision problems?The best available estimates, she said, come from a 2004 paper  aggregating many other studies, some in the United States and some in other countries, updated by applying later census data.This paper and others have found striking differences by age and by racial and socioeconomic groups, Dr. Vitale said. In white people, she said, the major cause of blindness at older ages is usually age-related macular degeneration, progressive damage to the central portion of the retina. In older black people, the major causes are likely to be glaucoma or cataracts. In older people of working age, from their 40s to their 60s, the major cause, regardless of race, is diabetic retinopathy, damage to the retina as a result of diabetes.Many studies have shown that white people are more likely to have age-related macular degeneration, Dr. Vitale said, but as for cataracts, for which blindness is preventable by surgery, there are questions about access to health care and whether those affected can get the needed surgery. It is not known why black people are at higher risk of glaucoma. There are also some gender differences, she said, with white women more likely than white men to become blind. Studies have not found the same difference by gender in black and Hispanic people.Because many of the causes of blindness at all ages are preventable, Dr. Vitale said, it is essential to have regular eye checkups, even if there are no obvious symptoms. question@nytimes.com"}
{"text": "Updated, 10:50 a.m. | Donald J. Trump on Tuesday declined to say what his effective tax rate was in 2014, and called comparisons of his pledge request that people at his rallies raise their hands and vow to support him to Nazi rallies ridiculous.Mr. Trump spoke via telephone in a series of morning television program interviews with NBCs Today show, MSNBCs Morning Joe and  Fox and Friends on Fox News.On Morning Joe, Mr. Trump swatted away a question about his tax rate and how much he gave to charity.I gave a lot of money to charity  I could release a list  I dont talk about my tax rate because Im under audit but when the audits finished, Ill give you my tax returns, said Mr. Trump, adding later that you cant learn very much from a tax return, almost, frankly, almost nothing.Mr. Trump has said he cannot release his tax returns, even older ones, because hes being audited by the Internal Revenue Service. Officials with the I.R.S. have said someone is free to release their returns even if theyre being audited.Mr. Trump also brushed aside questions about his recent move to ask voters at rallies to raise their right hands and promise to vote for him.When the Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski asked if Mr. Trump was trying in some way to emulate Adolf Hitler, as some critics have charged, he responded: Thats amazing that would even be brought up. Of course not. Of course not. Thats ridiculous. This is the first Ive heard of it this morning.Earlier, on Today, Mr. Trump first said of the pledge-Nazi comparisons, Until this call, I didnt know it was a problem.This week, President Enrique Pea Nieto of Mexico, whose country Mr. Trump has vowed to make pay for a wall along the United States southern border, invoked Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the founder of the fascist movement, when speaking about Mr. Trump. Thats the way Mussolini arrived and the way Hitler arrived, Mr. Nieto told the Exclsior newspaper about Mr. Trumps simplistic prescriptions for complex problems.On Fox and Friends, Mr. Trump was asked if he thinks its wrong to have a contested Republican National Convention even if he doesnt get the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.Whoever is leading at the end should sort of get it, I would think so, Mr. Trump said. That is the way democracy works. And I dont know that that is going to happen, but Ill tell you, there will be a lot of people that will be very upset if that doesnt happen, because we have really fervent, wonderful people."}
{"text": "BRUSSELS   Turkey surprised European Union leaders on Monday by hitting them with a new set of demands if it is to help stem the flow of refugees from Syria and Iraq and other migrants seeking to enter Europe.Leaders assessed the demands at an emergency summit meeting in Brussels, whereTurkeys prime minister asked for billions of euros in new assistance, easier access to visas for Turks to go to Europe and the dramatic acceleration of talks on Turkeys membership in the bloc, a discussion that has languished for years.The toughening of the Turkish position underscored Ankaras apparent attempt to win more support from Europe if it is going to be expected to protect the bloc from hundreds of thousands of new asylum seekers.But after a long day of negotiations that stretched into the early hours ofTuesday, the European leaders had made only partial progress, with many of them still assessing the terms. Even so, Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said leaders would meet again in Brussels onMarch 18.A proposal put forward by Turkey is a breakthrough if it is to be realized, if it is to be implemented, Ms. Merkel told a news conference at the end of the summit.Ms. Merkel said that under the proposed deal, for each person resettled directly from camps in Turkey to Europe, Turkey would in exchange accept one person who does not qualify for asylum in Europe to be returned to Turkey.The idea was to break, if you like, the vicious circle of entering an illegal boat, Ms. Merkel said, adding that the deal could restore orderly migration.David Cameron, the British prime minister, agreed that we do have the basis for a breakthrough, which is the possibility that in the future all migrants who arrive in Greece will be returned to Turkey.The Turkish demands, however, laid bare the European Unions weakening position and signaled that the difficulties  and costs  of managing the crisis might only rise the longer it stumbled on.Hoping to avoid a repeat of last year, when hundreds of thousands of refugees overwhelmed the authorities from Greece to Germany and beyond, European leaders were weighing whether to declare closed the route migrants have taken through the Balkans to Western Europe.But such a step threatens to bottle up migrants in Greece and has sharply divided European leaders, with Ms. Merkel reluctant to burden Greece, which is trying to regain its economic footing after a six-year debt crisis.There are 13,000 migrants stuck on the Greek border with Macedonia.You end up in situations like this when you have neglected to build the capacity to deal with the bigger issues of our time, said Fredrik Erixon, the director of the European Center for International Political Economy, a research group in Brussels.Turkey now is going to raise the costs for Europe, he added, and to such an extent that Europe may not be able to oppose Turkish goals in the region, including how to deal with Syria and the Kurds.Turkey is fighting Islamic extremists across its border with Syria as part of an international coalition that includes the United States, and it is confronting Kurdish militias that the Turks say are also a terrorist threat.As the meeting in Brussels got underway, Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu of Turkey reiterated calls for a safe zone in Syria where migrants could be free from the violence that has torn the country apart over the past five years.In a televised speech on Monday, Turkeys president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said the country had spent $10 billion caring for the Syrian refugees. He said the European Union had been slow to disburse the 3 billion euros (about $3.3 billion) it had already pledged to assist refugees in Turkey. The prime minister is in Brussels right now, Mr. Erdogan said of Mr. Davutoglu. I hope he returns with that money.The additional money, amounting to about 3 billion, that Turkey requested on Monday was a precondition for curbing new migrants from crossing the Aegean Sea to reach Europe.Mr. Davutoglu also surprised European leaders in a negotiating session that dragged into Monday morning by putting Turkeys attempts to join the European Union  a process known as accession  on the agenda.Turkey is ready to work with the E.U., Mr. Davutoglu said Monday. Turkey is ready to be a member of the E.U. as well. He added, I hope this summit, which will not focus only on irregular migration but also on the Turkish accession process to the E.U., will be a success story and a turning point in our relations.Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, which represents the leaders of the 28-nation European Union, included language about closing the Balkan route in a draft of a summit meeting statement, reinforcing his blunt warning last week to migrants who are seeking a better life in Europe but are not eligible for political asylum.Ms. Merkel resisted the wording of Mr. Tusks statement about closing the Balkan route.Germany also has been sharply at odds with a neighbor, Austria, after the government in Vienna restricted the flow of migrants, threatening the blocs system of passport-free travel.Others would like to see European borders stay shut.If we bring migrants from Greece or Turkey directly into Europe, thats an invitation to waltz, Hungarys right-wing prime minister, Viktor Orban, told reporters here. He added, Borders must be closed, and direct resettlement is out of the question, at least as far as Hungary is concerned.The record flow of more than one million migrants to the Continent last year exposed the inadequacy of the European Unions response to the geopolitical and humanitarian crisis caused by Syrias civil war. More than 140,000 people have arrived in the European Union by sea so far this year.Now much of the attention is on how to stop migrants from reaching Europe in the first place  and to distinguish Syrians and Iraqis, whose claims to asylum are generally viewed sympathetically, from those who are fleeing poverty and chaos elsewhere.For many years, Turkey has ostensibly been a candidate for European Union membership, but Mr. Erdogans authoritarian turn has made that seem like an ever more distant prospect.Human rights observers reacted angrily to a comment over the weekend in which the German interior minister, Thomas de Maizire, said, We should not be referees when it comes to human rights."}
{"text": "Its another primary day, with nominating contests from Mississippi to Hawaii. For the Democrats, its another opportunity for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to forge a path forward against Hillary Clinton. For the Republicans, its another chance to try to blunt the front-runner, Donald J. Trump, or a chance for the New York real-estate developer to further lock up delegates.In Michigan and Mississippi, both parties will hold primaries. Republicans will also hold caucuses in Hawaii and a primary in Idaho. Michigan is a rich opportunity for Mr. Sanders: Its a state where his populist message could resonate. Mrs. Clinton now leads Mr. Sanders in pledged delegates, and the map does not favor him going forward.On the Republican side, the contest, as it has been for weeks, is more fluid. If Mr. Trump wins Michigan, it will provide him a push after a tough outing last weekend on so-called Super Saturday. But Senator Ted Cruz of Texas is trying hard to keep it close or win outright, and Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio hopes to do well. For Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, another weak showing could be problematic.If Republicans deny Mr. Trump a win, it will bolster their efforts to keep him from locking up the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination. But Mr. Cruz has struggled with evangelical voters in the campaign since Iowa, despite being the candidate with the clearest argument to the right of Mr. Trump. If Mr. Cruz does not rise in Mississippi, his inability to consolidate social conservatives will be a factor."}

And the result is often sloppy, ungrammatical writing that leaves readers annoyed or appalled. Here is the latest sampling of singular/plural tribulations (thanks to colleagues and readers for many examples):The push by Mr. Xis to assert state control over the markets and the economy go against the philosophy of Chinas early reformers under Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who sought to give more space to the market.As frequently happens, the phrase between the subject and verb threw us off. Most often, as here, a singular subject is followed by a plural noun, and we are misled into using a plural verb. Make it the push  goes. (Also, theres no need for the possessive Xis.)That may still be the case, but the success of small endowments like Southern Virginias suggest that they can outperform even their largest and most prestigious rivals by sticking to lower-cost strategies.Same problem. The subject is success, not endowments, so make it the success  suggests.Mr. Hayden took over the C.I.A. after authorization of coercive interrogation tactics were withdrawn, but he remains a defender.And again.

The relative clause is intended to describe those judges  the group of whom Meen is, in this case, not one example. Make it those judges who drag out their decisions as if they were  Or, alternatively, say Meen is not the kind of judge who drags out Each of the three girls wore their hair pulled away from their faces in a traditional burial style for women, according to the local authorities, signaling that they were prepared to die.Each is singular. Make it Each of the three girls wore her hair (Underscoring the difficulty of keeping these kind of productions secret, especially when they involve major stars, word leaked last spring that Mr. Ferrell and Kristen Wiig were working privately on a Lifetime movie called A Deadly Adoption, which ran in June.)These is plural but kind is singular, so this doesnt work. Make it this kind of production or these kinds of productions.In a WordThis weeks grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.Perhaps the most vexing part of the law, Dr. Steiner said, was that it created an environment where administrators like himself felt responsible for enforcing a law they see as detrimental to students and colleagues.Make it administrators like him. Theres no need for the reflexive -self form of the pronoun, which is used when the subject and object of the clause are the same person.Mr. Rubio seemed to relish his new role as a mischievous and combative saboteur, theatrically reading Mr. Trumps misspelled online postings in front of an audience in Dallas and describing what he said was Mr. Trumps descent into anxiety-ridden sweatiness backstage in between commercial breaks at their debate Thursday night.Presumably they were backstage during commercial breaks, not in between.Bird, a first-base prospect who the Yankees clung to at the nonwaiver trade deadline last July, was called up shortly afterward to provide a break for Mark Teixeira and designated hitter Alex Rodriguez.Make it whom the Yankees clung to, or simply drop the pronoun: a first-base prospect the Yankees clung to The Republicans reiterated that it would not matter who Mr. Obama put forward, Republican or Democrat, no matter how accomplished a jurist  the nomination would be dead on arrival.Make it whom Mr. Obama put forward.Leading up to the vote, Mr. Morales found himself on the defense over multiple issues, including a scandal involving a child born out of wedlock and accusations of corruption at a fund for development of native communities.The idiom is on the defensive, or perhaps on defense.Not everything about Hollywood appealed to The Globe team, however.In this construction, the goes with team, not with Globe, so it should be lowercase.When uttered by a man, the words will you marry me serve to signal a tradition that is both widely accepted and ages old. Having the same spoken by a woman however  except in a leap year like 2016, when an old Irish tradition of having the woman ask is known to emerge  are still surprisingly rare.This paragraph is a jumble.

{"text": "SUIT OVER HATE MAIL EMBROILS MARVEL CHIEF   |  Isaac Perlmutter, the enigmatic billionaire chief executive of Marvel Entertainment, has become embroiled in a legal soap opera that has been playing out in Palm Beach and New York courts,Andrew Ross Sorkin writes in the DealBook column.In the Sloans Curve community, where Mr. Perlmutter lives, the tennis program is run by Karen D. Donnelly  a favorite of Mr. Perlmutter, who is an avid tennis player.When Harold Peerenboom, a Toronto businessman who founded a successful executive search firm, moved into the community in 2007, he learned that Ms. Donnelly worked without a contract and had not bid for the work. Mr. Peerenboom claimed that amounted to bid-rigging under Florida law and made his objection known to the homeowners organization. The board, nudged by Mr. Perlmutter, overruled Mr. Peerenboom and reworked the agreement so that Ms. Donnelly did not have to submit a competitive bid to run the tennis complex.Ms. Donnelly then filed a lawsuit against Mr. Peerenboom, paid for by Mr. Perlmutter, contending that she had been slandered.Mr. Peerenboom says he was then subject to a hate-letter writing campaign. His neighbors and business associates received letters claiming that Mr. Peerenboom was a child molester and that he killed a couple who were found dead of asphyxiation.Mr. Peerenboom has never been accused of these crimes and is now trying to compel Marvel to produce Mr. Perlmutters emails.The case has become an example of the strange and high stakes private legal battles that executives at public companies become involved in. They do not always become public, but they do raise questions about corporate governance.How much responsibility does a public company have to investigate a controversial private matter involving a senior executive? At what point should an executive be suspended? Should a private legal matter have any bearing on an executives work?Its very subjective, said Charles M. Elson, a professor of finance and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. Thats why you have a board.VISIUM HEDGE FUND UNDER INVESTIGATION  |  Visium Asset Management is being investigated by the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nAlexandra Stevenson reports in DealBook.\nThe fund told investors that the agencies had requested information from several years ago relating to the valuation of securities in a credit fund that Visium shut in 2013.

{"text": "WASHINGTON   American aircraft on Saturday struck a training camp in Somalia belonging to the Islamist militant group the Shabab, the Pentagon said, killing about 150 fighters who were assembled for what American officials believe was a graduation ceremony and prelude to an imminent attack against American troops and their allies in East Africa.Defense officials said the strike was carried out by drones and American aircraft, which dropped a number of precision-guided bombs and missiles on the field where the fighters were gathered. Pentagon officials said they did not believe there were any civilian casualties, but there was no independent way to verify the claim. They said they delayed announcing the strike until they could assess the outcome.It was the deadliest attack on the Shabab in the more than decade-long American campaign against the group, an affiliate of Al Qaeda, and a sharp deviation from previous American strikes, which have concentrated on the groups leaders, not on its foot soldiers.It comes in response to new concerns that the group, which was responsible for one of the deadliest terrorist attacks on African soil when it struck a popular mall in Nairobi in 2013, is in the midst of a resurgence after losing much of the territory it once held and many of its fighters in the last several years. The planned attack on American and African Union troops in Somalia, American officials say, may have been an attempt by the Shabab to carry out the same kind of high-impact act of terrorism as the one in Nairobi.The fighters had just completed training for a large-scale attack against American and African Union forces, said Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman.Pentagon officials would not say how they knew that the Shabab fighters killed on Saturday were training for an attack on United States and African Union forces, but the militant group is believed to be under heavy American surveillance.The Shabab fighters were standing in formation at a facility the Pentagon called Camp Raso, 120 miles north of Mogadishu, when the American warplanes struck on Saturday, officials said, acting on information gleaned from intelligence sources in the area and from American spy planes. One intelligence agency assessed that the toll might have been higher had the strike happened earlier in the ceremony. Apparently, some fighters were filtering away from the event when the bombing began.The strike was another escalation in what has become the latest battleground in the Obama administrations war against terror: Africa. The United States and its allies are focused on combating the spread of the Islamic State in Libya, and American officials estimate that with an influx of men from Iraq, Syria and Tunisia, the Islamic States forces in Libya have swelled to as many as 6,500 fighters, allowing the group to capture a 150-mile stretch of coastline over the past year.The arrival of the Islamic State in Libya has sparked fears that the groups reach could spread to other North African countries, and the United States is increasingly trying to prevent that. American forces are now helping to combat Al Qaeda in Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso; Boko Haram in Nigeria, Cameroon and Chad; and the Shabab in Somalia and Kenya, in what has become a multifront war against militant Islam in Africa.The United States has a small number of trainers and advisers with African Union  primarily Kenyan  troops in Somalia. Defense officials said that the African Unions military mission to Somalia was believed to have been the target of the planned attack.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, called the attack a good example of how the United States military can work with local partners to advance security.The removal of those terrorist fighters degrades Al Shababs ability to meet the groups objectives in Somalia, including recruiting new members, establishing bases and planning attacks on the U.S., Mr. Earnest told reporters on Monday. He insisted that avoiding civilian casualties is a very very high priority, both for moral reasons but also because extremist organizations like Al Shabab would just use the death of innocent civilians to try to recruit additional members and whip up additional anti-U.S. sentiment.Saturdays strike was the most significant American attack on the Shabab since September 2014, when an American drone strike killed the leader of the group, Ahmed Abdi Godane, at the time one of the most wanted men in Africa. That strike was followed by one last March, when Adan Garar, a senior member of the group, was killed in a drone strike on his vehicle.If the killings of Mr. Godane and Mr. Garar initially crippled the group, that no longer appears to be the case. In the past two months, Shabab militants have claimed responsibility for attacks that have killed more than 150 people, including Kenyan soldiers stationed at a remote desert outpost and beachcombers in Mogadishu.In addition, the group has said it was responsible for a bomb on a Somali jetliner that tore a hole through the fuselage and for an attack last month on a popular hotel and a public garden in Mogadishu that killed 10 people and injured more than 25. On Monday, the Shabab claimed responsibility for a bomb planted in a laptop computer that went off at an airport security checkpoint in the town of Beletwein in central Somalia, wounding at least six people, including two police officers. The police said that one other bomb was defused.At the same time, Shabab assassination teams have fanned out across Mogadishu and other major towns, stealthily eliminating government officials and others they consider apostates.The Shabab have also retaken several towns after African Union forces pulled out. The African Union peacekeeping force, paid for mostly by Western governments, features troops from Uganda, Burundi, Kenya, Djibouti and other African nations.The Shabab were once strong, then greatly weakened and now seem to be somewhere in between, while analysts say the group competes with the Islamic State for recruits and tries to show  in the deadliest way  that it is still relevant. Its dream is to turn Somalia into a pure Islamic state.The Pentagons announcement of the attack in Somalia came as the Obama administration said it planned in the future to be more transparent about the number of casualties caused by the use of counterterrorism strikes outside declared war zones. Lisa Monaco, President Obamas counterterrorism and homeland security adviser, said a report would be released in the coming weeks, on the total number of casualties caused by strikes since Mr. Obama took office."}
{"text": "Everyone owes Marcia Clark an apology.This weeks episode is titled Marcia, Marcia, Marcia, and one of its big focuses is how brutally and consistently Clark was harassed for the way she looked. Which, by the way, was fine  she looked perfectly fine. Her treatment was fueled by a deep-seated sexism that was par for the course in the post-feminist 1990s. Revisionist history will have you believe that the Riot Grrrl movement dominated the decade, but those of us who lived it can tell you that the mainstream denigration of Marcia Clark was more of the day-to-day-reality faced by most women.Television newscasters said that the way Clark dressed was a cry for help, and radio hosts asked listeners to call and weigh in on whether Clark was a bitch or a babe. Gil Garcetti lands the one-two punch of telling Clark hes appalled at the sexist things being said about her on television, but that he can also recommend a media consultant. Sarah Paulson plays through these scenes with a mixture of steel-eyed intensity and tender sadness. Clark was a woman stuck in a moment between the second-wave feminist ideals that insisted that she has a right to claim space in this world, and the third-wave feminist movement that would demand it.Watching Clark morph from a woman with a job to a lightning rod of public scrutiny is one of the most heartbreaking aspects of this episode, second only to the fact that she seems to know she cant really do anything about it. She smiles her way through a mini-makeover with a hairdresser who insists he can give her a transformative experience. When she emerges with a shorter, curlier haircut, Clark seems to feel powerful and confident. Then she walks into the courtroom. There are obvious snickers when Judge Lance Ito says, Good morning, Ms. Clark. I think, and O. J. himself mocks her by giving a sarcastic thumbs up. Even though her co-counselor, Christopher Darden, encourages her by writing Its fantastic, I love it! on a notepad for her to see, Clarks smile fades.Later, at a grocery store, Clark stares down tabloid headlines about her new look  Curls of Horror, Marcia Hair Verdict: Guilty, and Hair-Raising Salon Disaster. When the clerk at the register picks up the tampons shes buying and says, Uh oh, I guess the defense is in for one hell of a week, huh? Clark just stares at him. She knows the brutal truth: In the court of public opinion, she simply cannot win. Sexism is a poison that seeps into every aspect of her life.This is also happening the same week theyre putting Mark Fuhrman, their most controversial witness, on the stand. Its not as though Clark doesnt have other things to worry about.Maybe shed be more stoic if she werent also in the middle of a difficult custody battle with an ex-husband, Gordon, who judges her for leaving their children with a babysitter while she works on the most important case of her career. Theres a day when shes openly mocked in court for telling Judge Ito she cant stay late because she has child-care concerns; when she ends up having to stay late at the office anyway, Gordon not only petitions for full custody, but gives a news conference about how terrible Clark is at being a mother.Theres a sweet scene that opens the episode, when Clarks son Travis wakes up in the middle of the night to give her a hug; her kids seem happy and healthy, leaving you to believe whats really being judged is the fact that Clark has the audacity to live life on her own terms.I was bothered rather than heartened by Dardens treatment of Clark this week. Sure, he called the radio show to cast his vote for Clark as a babe, and he tried to make her feel better by dancing with her, singing to her and writing her encouraging notes, but it came across as more paternalistic than supportive. He kept reminding me of that quote about all it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing: Instead of trying to bolster Clark, why wasnt he commenting publicly about the sexism she was facing?Instead of calling into radio shows, why not tell Johnnie Cochran he was out of order for joking about Clarks child-care issues in court? The problem isnt that Darden is treating Clark with kindness, but that hes putting a Band-Aid on the wrong wound. Darden is upset and confronts a journalist about the fact that hes not on the cover of any papers when Clark wants nothing more than to step out of that spotlight. Darden is complicit in benefiting from the sexism he seems to abhor.The most revealing moment of how sexism worked against Clark actually featured Cochran. At first, he is flying high  he successfully confronts the detective who took crucial evidence home to Simi Valley for six hours, and maneuvers Judge Ito into changing the rules so he can have a witness, Rosa Lopez, testify five months before she was scheduled to do so. When Lopez tanks on the stand, a journalist confronts Cochran outside about his own history with domestic abuse. Later we see Cochran placing a phone call to his ex-wife, offering her the proceeds from an apartment building he just sold with the underlying message that it would be in exchange for her silence about their domestic abuse issue.This is all strangely juxtaposed by the way the public perceives the case as pure entertainment. Networks pre-empt soap operas since O. J. is the best soap weve got. Two mechanics watching the courtroom on a small TV in the garage hope they bring back Kato Kaelin to the show, he was great. When F. Lee Bailey cross-examines Fuhrman on his use of a racial epithet, network executives immediately air a prime-time special about it.Clark finally breaks when her first ex-husband sells naked photos of her to a tabloid. She cries quietly in court, and Judge Ito calls a recess when he finally seems to realize the scrutiny is too much. Later, crying on the floor of her office, she tells Darden: Im not a public personality. I dont know how to do this.At the beginning of the episode, Clark asks, Why should I be penalized for doing my job? The sad truth is that we still dont have an answer for her."}
{"text": "It lacked the vulgarities and, most likely, the ratings of the Republican debate on Thursday. But the Democratic face-off in Flint, Mich., on Sunday provided revealing moments and insights into the candidates and their campaigns. Two days before the Michigan primary, there were displays of impatience, passion, policy knowledge and, perhaps, fatigue.Here are some takeaways from the debate:Asked a provocative and difficult question  what racial blind spots do you have?  Hillary Clinton dodged with all the elegance of a supertanker, instead answering a previous question before being pushed again by a moderator.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont detoured briefly to a not-at-all-brief story about being with a black lawmaker who could not catch a cab, and then he explained awkwardly that when youre white, you dont know what its like to be living in a ghetto. While each candidate spoke with conviction about the need to tackle incarceration rates and economic opportunity for African-Americans, both seemed to be walking on eggshells.Dispense with the idea that Mrs. Clinton will try to patiently outlast Mr. Sanders while she piles up enough delegates to wrap up the nomination. This debate showcased both candidates leveling their strongest attacks at each other.Mrs. Clinton, in particular, showed that her team was still carefully evaluating Mr. Sanders for vulnerabilities, as when she assailed him for voting against the 2008 auto-industry bailout. Whatever concerns her team has about alienating Mr. Sanderss voters  whose support will be needed in a general election  were not evident on Sunday.There were moments Sunday night when Mrs. Clinton was clearly exasperated by questions focused on issues from the 1990s and policies  such as the overhaul of the welfare system  enacted under her husband, President Bill Clinton. But Mrs. Clinton has also turned toward her husbands administration, whether to rebut Mr. Sanderss attacks or to bolster her own.Criticized over the welfare changes, Mrs. Clinton mentioned the rousing job growth of the 1990s and its positive effect on African-Americans income. Whether by choice or necessity, Mrs. Clinton is running as a defender of not only President Obamas legacy, but also her husbands.While Mr. Sanderss direct rhetoric is an enduring source of his success, Mrs. Clinton has a way of meandering legalistically through thickets of caution and temporization.Asked whether she would fire the head of the Environmental Protection Agency for failing to remedy water problems in Flint, Mrs. Clinton gave a nearly 200-word response emphasizing the need for a full investigation to determine who knew what, when. Mr. Sanders 16-word response drew enormous applause: President Sanders would fire anybody who knew about what was happening and did not act appropriately.The CNN moderator Anderson Cooper asked both candidates whether teachers unions protect bad teachers. Mr. Sanders did not come near answering the question, instead talking about his plan to provide free college tuition. Mrs. Clinton came only slightly closer. Teachers do so much good, they are often working under the most difficult circumstances, she said. So anything that could be changed, I want them to look at it.The early debates were feats of elaborate politesse by two candidates each pretending that the road to the White House did not run through the other. Now, every response of Mrs. Clintons to a Sanders attack betrays a barely concealed weariness.For all the talk from her campaign last spring that Mrs. Clinton expected the march to the nomination to be a long one, her manner is that of a contender who cannot quite believe the other guy is still at it. Mr. Sanders has grown no fonder of Mrs. Clinton. General insinuations that she is too close to the countrys powerful and financial elite to govern well have given way to harsher and more direct attacks  suggesting that Mr. Sanders believes that she truly is corrupt.In her 2000 Senate race in New York, Mrs. Clinton managed to turn a debate challenge from Rick A. Lazio, a House Republican, into a major stumble. After he approached her lectern with a written pledge to abstain from spending so-called soft money in the campaign, her aides cast his move as inappropriate, even bullying.On Sunday, Mrs. Clinton and her team seemed eager to bait Mr. Sanders  whose long arms and bellowing urgency leave him physically dominating their shared television space  into a similar moment. When Mrs. Clinton tried to talk over one of his answers, Mr. Sanders snapped back, Excuse me, Im talking. Her campaign later blasted out an email suggesting Mr. Sanders had a problem with his tone.To a nation still wondering why the Republican candidates are publicly debating penis size and incontinence, the Democrats offered a largely substantive debate about domestic policy. There were deep dives into gun control, trade policy and the environment. Mrs. Clinton gave voters the most vigorous defense of the Export-Import Bank presented in either partys race.Whether voters like the ideas or not, they are at least being discussed. The danger for the Republicans is not optical, but political: Mr. Trumps insult-comic approach to the campaign has made it impossible for the partys candidates to discuss and debate their best ideas on issues like education and job growth."}
{"text": "Democrats have regularly argued that, with a robust populist pitch, winning back white working-class voters could be within reach.In 2016, there is evidence that, with the impact of Donald J. Trump on the race, that could actually happen.In the past, Republicans could appeal to both more tolerant and intolerant white working-class voters through dog whistles. But if Mr. Trump is the Republican nominee, his open appeal to racial and xenophobic sentiments  calling for the deportation of Latino immigrants, barring Muslims from entering the country and flirting with white supremacists  could push at least some part of the tolerant sector to the Democratic side.Meanwhile, Democrats are going after that more tolerant sector with a progressive populism initially and charismatically championed by Bernie Sanders but increasingly advocated by Hillary Clinton as well.The New Hampshire primary provided some encouragement for Democrats. Among white voters without a college degree, Mr. Sanders won more votes than Mr. Trump. According to data I calculated from the CNN exit polls, Mr. Sanders received 29 percent of their ballots, ahead of 24 percent for Mr. Trump. In another contest, the Massachusetts primary on Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders won 36 percent of that groups votes, in contrast to 27 percent for Mr. Trump. Not far behind, Mrs. Clinton received 24 percent of that vote. The combined Democratic vote in Massachusetts was a robust 60 percent.But Massachusetts is not all of America. To win over white working-class voters in the general election, Democrats will have to offer practical proposals in line with progressive populism.The battle will be most intense in the critical Rust Belt states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. The most in-depth recent research on the political attitudes of these Americans was conducted in December and January by Working America, a progressive grass-roots organization. They went door to door to talk to over 1,698 residents of white working-class neighborhoods around Cleveland and Pittsburgh.They confirmed that Mr. Trump has two distinct groups of supporters. The first are the ideologically driven conservative voters who passionately support his belligerent ethnocentrism.The second group is composed of fed up voters who are not primarily ideological in their political perspective and whose vote would be largely a protest against business as usual rather than an affirmation of Mr. Trumps rhetoric. For many of these voters, the financial crisis and the bailouts for investment banks severely strained their trust in the federal government.Interviewers found that only one-third of the white working-class voters they spoke with were firm conservatives. A roughly equal number fell instead into a less ideological category: These voters dont follow politics closely and prefer pragmatic, common-sense solutions to the countrys problems.Many of them agree with some progressive proposals, but they bear deep hostility toward big government.Research by the pollster Stan Greenberg has documented the depth and intensity of this view. His conclusion is that many white working-class voters would be willing to support progressive economic policies if they didnt distrust governments ability to act in the public interest. Above all, these voters want assurance of meaningful government reform to ensure that policies actually will help people like them.White working-class voters are open to an expansive Democratic economic agenda, Mr. Greenberg said in an interview. Yet they are only ready to listen when they think that Democrats understand their deeply held belief that politics has been corrupted and government has failed. Championing reform of government and the political process is the price of admission with these voters.In 2016, many white working-class men and women are uniquely open to a Democratic appeal based on populist proposals if expressed in a way compatible with practical common sense, because the Republicans will be basing their appeal on the opposite  an angry appeal to either nationalism (in Mr. Trumps case, like building a wall on the Mexico border) or conservative extremism, including huge tax cuts that benefit the wealthy (as in Ted Cruzs flat-tax plan).That said, Democrats face a tough challenge, as the Super Tuesday contests illustrate. In Virginia, a state generally considered more representative of the country, Mr. Sanders received only 15 percent of the white non-college vote, while Mr. Trump claimed 33 percent. In Georgia, Mr. Sanders won an abysmal 7 percent, in contrast to Mr. Trumps 40 percent.With Hillary Clinton garnering 16 percent in Virginia and 9 percent in Georgia, the combined Democratic share of the white working-class vote in Virginia was 31 percent, and only 15 percent in Georgia.To the extent that Virginia can be considered a reasonably representative state, that 31 percent support is notably below the roughly 35 percent national level of support Barack Obama got from that demographic in the 2012 elections and the 34 percent level of support Democrats received in the 2014 midterms. While the Democratic turnout in the general election is likely to significantly improve on the low numbers of Super Tuesday, the primary results reveal the difficulty of the challenge.Still, Democrats do not have to regain the majority of white working-class support that they enjoyed in the 1950s and 1960s to succeed. With the relative decline of that demographic as a percentage of the electorate, if Democrats can reliably earn above 35 percent or 36 percent of their vote, they will be in a very strong position in November."}

{"text": "PARIS  Long before the large-scale migrant crisis began to haunt Europe, the camp at Calais in northern France was the object of political contention and humanitarian indignation.Now the camp, known as the Jungle and home to thousands of desperate people hoping against all odds to cross the English Channel to Britain, has become an issue in the debate about whether Britain should leave the European Union. Or is it a scarecrow?Last month, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain used the Calais camp as a crucial part of his argument that voters should vote to stay in the European Union during a referendum in June.If Britain were to leave, he said, France might abandon a 13-year-old bilateral treaty that, for the purposes of immigration, effectively moved the border with Britain to the French side of the channel.Last week, President Franois Hollande chimed in with vague warnings about the consequences of a British departure. He mentioned trade and finances but also people, namely immigration. By that, he meant Calais.Many experts and politicians, particularly in Britain but also in France, doubt that France would revisit the 2003 treaty of Le Touquet, which shifted the border controls.They note that it is in Frances interests to control the border on its territory, not only to protect a vital trade route across the channel but also to avoid an even greater flood of migrants huddling on its shores.That is the stated position of Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, who has predicted a humanitarian disaster if the border agreement changes.In Britain, supporters of a departure said the French position was a bluff. I would say, Donnez-moi un break,  said the mayor of London, Boris Johnson, a member of Mr. Camerons party, the Conservatives, who has become one of the leading campaigners for an exit. Theres absolutely no reason why that treaty should be changed.Yet some in France maintain that the Touquet treaty, negotiated by Nicolas Sarkozy, then the French interior minister, and his British counterpart at the time, David Blunkett, is deeply flawed and against the nations interest.Alain Jupp, the mayor of Bordeaux and a leading candidate  against Mr. Sarkozy  for the presidential nomination of Frances main opposition party, called the current situation unsustainable.We must negotiate to re-examine the 2003 treaty, he told La Voix du Nord, a regional newspaper, in January.Olivier Cahn, a law professor at the Cergy-Pontoise University and an expert on French-British relations, considers the Touquet treaty to be very disadvantageous to France.He said the annual cost of managing both the security and the humanitarian situation at Calais is 80 million euros, or about $88 million. Britain last week increased its contribution to 57 million from 35 million.More important than the money is the principle, Mr. Cahn said. France has to receive these people and determine who they are, he added. The British just say they are not welcome.The number of asylum seekers in Britain dropped to just 32,414 last year, of which 61 percent were initially refused, from about 80,000 in 2003.A recent British court decision in favor of five migrants at Calais who were seeking to join family members in Britain could open a new path for others, particularly several hundred unaccompanied children, now stranded in France.We have done our best to make it as hard as possible, said Jonathan Portes, a senior fellow at U.K. in a Changing Europe, a research organization.Still, even in the event of a British departure, Mr. Portes says France is unlikely to challenge the 2003 treaty, a view that he thinks is quietly shared by even pro-European Union policy makers.It is scaremongering, he said, but this is politics, and it is getting dirty. A lot of things are being said on both sides that are dubious, exaggerated or factually inaccurate.Mr. Cahn said France might be seeking to use the issue as leverage for British concessions in other spheres, perhaps cooperation in the fight against terrorism. But, he said, that will not do much to help the migrants stuck in Calais, fenced into one of the most heavily secured corners of France."}

{"text": "Its not as if no one writes about sex among the senior set. Novels and poems increasingly bring us news from this front. John Betjemans poem Late-Flowering Lust, written many decades ago, began with a man presenting himself this way: My head is bald, my breath is bad/Unshaven is my chin.In 2003 Jane Juska had a hit with A Round-Heeled Woman, a book about what happened after she placed this classified advertisement in The New York Review of Books: Before I turn 67  next March  I would like to have a lot of sex with a man I like. If you want to talk first, Trollope works for me.In Arlene Heymans first book, the short-story collection Scary Old Sex, she pays such sustained and stylish attention to late-life lovemaking, however, that you may feel you are reading about it for the first time. Viagra tablets, stretch marks, over-the-counter lubricants, strange moles: oh my. The sex can still be powerful and moving, one of Ms. Heymans narrators comments, so long as she kept her eyes and her critical faculties shut, at least mostly.Ms. Heyman is a psychiatrist in New York City. She wrote the stories in Scary Old Sex over three decades. Two have appeared on the honor rolls of The Best American Short Stories.When young, the author was a student of Bernard Malamuds at Bennington College and earned an M.A. from Syracuse University; she was a promising writer. She mostly gave up the literary life for medical school and raising a family. We can be glad she didnt abandon it completely, and has been slowly composing these mature and soulful stories.Ms. Heymans characters tend to live, as do so many practicing psychiatrists, on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. They are artists and doctors and academics and documentary filmmakers. They used to date Alvin Ailey dancers; their sons own bookstores; they have 45-year-old memories of playing on the Bryn Mawr soccer team. One subscribes to Dissent and MIT Technology Review.Not all of these stories are about sex, about finding new ways to have fun in the dark. Some are about illness and aging and caring for elderly parents and wayward adult children. But Ms. Heymans earthiest and most sustained and impressive writing finds its center of gravity at crotch level.She is so rueful and funny and observant. Here is one woman on her second husband, who walks toward bed as if out of Betjemans poem: He came in naked and she remembered again why she did not like to make love in the daytime.She continues: There he was, every wrinkle exposed, as if he were in a Lucian Freud painting. He had loose flesh on his chest, small sagging breasts beneath his nipples, and little pink outgrowths here and there. His pubic hair was colorless and sparse, and he happened to have the smallest penis she had ever seen, although he was a large bear of a man.During their (not terrible) sex, her dialogue includes this line: Always multitasking, arent you. Mens bodies are beloved but ruthlessly scrutinized in these stories. There is no gauzy film on this writers camera lens.One woman realizes it is the daily familiarity with her husbands body she is missing, the handling of his old knobby flesh. Aged flesh is so fertile, grows excrescences: papules, papillomas, skin tags, moles that have to be checked yearly; yet the hair thins out, underarm and pubic, as if the soil had changed to one that no longer supports the verdant shrubbery, but instead nourishes an astonishing variety of wild mushrooms  beautiful, if you have an eye.Womens bodies are similarly scrutinized: bony posteriors, wiry hair, acid reflux, the yearning her breasts seem to have developed for her waist. At the same time, Ms. Heymans stories are seriously sexy; they generate a lot of heat. Read them in public and you might be seen blushing.The stories in Scary Old Sex arent soft. A few take startling turns and have edges made from razor wire. There is incest and sudden death; some dark fantasies have real undertow. (A woman imagines plunging the blade of a pocketknife into her elderly mothers trachea.)Ms. Heyman is an enlightened observer across many aspects of life. Dogs, for example. Here is her description of a woman behind the wheel: As she pulled into their gravel driveway the dogs yapped briefly and then quieted, recognizing whatever modern day dogs recognize: the rhythm of the mistresss motor? The scent of her buffers and fixatives?A few of these seven stories dont entirely work. Some sag somewhat toward the middle, like the insides of some of the thighs she describes. But Ms. Heyman is never an uninteresting writer.The human comedy is on peacock display here. One women, upset by how timid her second husband is about asking for sex, mutters about him: He was reluctant even to ask for all dark meat from the Chirping Chicken take-out place.One of the takeaways from Scary Old Sex is that old sex isnt so scary at all. These men and women are busily and blissfully humanizing themselves, the kind of bliss that lifts right off the page."}

It was Mr. Trumps two-word insult  dubbing Mr. Bush low-energy  that helped devastate Mr. Bushs campaign, as voters parroted back the phrase and Mr. Bush, who in fact routinely held several free-wheeling events every day, was never able to fully shake the moniker.The relationship between Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio is especially fraught.

{"text": "PARIS  Dmitri Tcherniakov had not slept all night. It was the day after the dress rehearsal of his double bill of Tchaikovskys opera Iolanta and his ballet The Nutcracker for the Paris Opera here, and he was still feeling overwrought. So much is going on in my head, he said, gesturing expansively. This is so big and complicated.Iolanta/The Nutcracker, directed by Mr. Tcherniakov, which is to open on Wednesday night at the Palais Garnier, unless delayed by a national strike, is indeed big and complicated, and ambitious, too. It reunites two works that had their premieres on the same night, Dec. 18, 1892, at the Imperial Mariinsky Theater in St. Petersburg, and in the process transforms The Nutcracker. In this new staging theres not a sugarplum in sight.The fates of the opera and the ballet have been very different. The one-act Iolanta, the tale of a blind princess who recovers her sight through love for a noble knight, was immediately successful. (Mahler conducted it in Munich a year after the premiere). Later it fell into obscurity and is rarely seen today. The Nutcracker, though it had a lukewarm reception in 1892, became one of the most popular ballets in the world, with a score familiar even to non-dancegoers.Iolanta and Nutcracker have rarely been presented together since their debuts. (An exception was the centenary staging of Iolanta by Opera North with Matthew Bournes Nutcracker at the 1992 Edinburgh festival.) Its not hard to work out why. The four-hour Palais Garnier production  conducted by Alain Altinoglu and choreographed by Arthur Pita, Edouard Lock and Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui  has involved 180 performers (singers, musicians, dancers and supernumeraries), complex rehearsal schedules and an army of technicians and stagehands.The Imperial Theater was like a state within a state and it could do anything, Mr. Tcherniakov said, speaking of the boldness of the original commission. From an organizational point of view, it is extremely difficult. And artistically it is a big, big risk.Luckily, Mr. Tcherniakov, 45, likes to fight with scary things, he said in an interview on Sunday at a cafe opposite the Palais Garnier. Thats just as well, since despite having won international fame and some notoriety for his visionary, radical opera productions, including Mussorgskys Boris Godunov and a much-debated Eugene Onegin at the Bolshoi, he isnt exactly known for his collaborative spirit. And he has little experience working with ballet, though, he said, he grew up watching it and had seen at least 20 Nutcrackers.Dark-haired, lightly bearded and stocky, Mr. Tcherniakov was charming, funny and highly focused despite his tiredness; he spoke in Russian through a translator, but often paused to correct or discuss an English word with characteristic attention to detail.I understood that the risks are enormous, he said. But ballet and opera dont usually have such a friendship between them, so for me it is a utopian idea, to mix these two art forms.When Mr. Tcherniakov suggested the idea to Stphane Lissner, the director of the Paris Opera, Mr. Lissner said he was first surprised, then delighted (and never daunted). The desire that I have for my time at the Opera is to unite dance and opera, to show that we are a single entity, he said in a telephone interview. With Dmitri, its always a very long process. Long emails, long meetings in different cities, many telephone conversations.Mr. Tcherniakov, famous for his intensive preparation and control over almost all elements of a production (he designs his own sets), said he knew he didnt want to stage a traditional Nutcracker. He developed an elaborate libretto, which incorporates surreal and at times frightening settings and experiences that take it far from the Christmas cheer, snowflakes and sweets in the traditional Nutcracker. Its decidedly not for children. (Any echoes of the E.T.A. Hoffmann story that the original is based on are, he said, probably an unconscious response to the music.)The goal was to continue the ideas in Iolanta, he said. In a certain sense, the main characters in both works have to go through the same ordeals, to overcome fear. Although Mr. Tcherniakov did not want to describe too much before the premiere, he said he had linked some of the opera and ballet characters, and woven a dancer into the opera, and Sonya Yoncheva, who sings Iolanta, into the start of the ballet. There is a move into the surreal, but it doesnt mean that what happens is a fantasy or a dreaming trance, he added. Everything that happens has its own reality.The decision to use several choreographers happened early on, he said. I dont want a homogeneous theatrical language, I want to see the absolute transformation of the characters from one scene to the next, he explained. One choreographer could never change so drastically in style as to be unrecognizable.After a discussion with Benjamin Millepied, the director of dance at the Opera, and Mr. Lissner, Mr. Tcherniakov chose five choreographers (Mr. Millepied and Liam Scarlett were part of the initial team), later paring back to Mr. Lock, Mr. Cherkouai and Mr. Pita. Each was given specific scenarios to choreograph; an unusual and not entirely comfortable experience for everyone concerned.This was very uneasy for me, Mr. Tcherniakov said. I had to switch off my control freak, and give the choreographers some freedom to make decisions. Its the first time in my life I have done that. He laughed. It was uneasy for them too, given my character.Mr. Pita, a South African-born choreographer who lives in London, said Mr. Tcherniakov was extremely specific. There really was a task and I had to stick to the rules, he said in an interview on Saturday at the opera house. Mr. Pita added that there was no collaborative discussion among the choreographers about the shape of the work. There was a lot of mystery around what everyone else was doing.Mr. Tcherniakov said that mystery was intentional. I wanted them to remain contrasted, the way they are, he said. It is up to me to make the links between them. I am the builder. He paused. Like in a factory; the assembler.The Belgian-born Mr. Cherkaoui, who is the artistic director of the National Ballet of Flanders, said the experience reminded him of working on a movie. You have to let go and give things over at times, he said. Then there is an editor afterward. The work has its own soul in the end, it goes beyond you personally and that comes from a lot of hands in there.Mr. Tcherniakov had another definition. Its a kind of risky experiment in group sex, he said, bursting into laughter. Maybe it will give me some artistic surprises which Im not able to invent myself."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON   Marylands highest court on Tuesday ordered a Baltimore police officer who is charged in the death of Freddie Gray to testify for the prosecution in the trials of his fellow officers. The ruling clears the way for the state to move ahead with long-stalled prosecutions in a case that has become a touchstone in the emotional national debate over race and policing.In a pair of simple four-paragraph orders that did not lay out the courts reasoning, the Maryland Court of Appeals announced its decision to compel the officer, William G. Porter, to testify under a grant of limited immunity, meaning what he says cannot be used against him in his own trial. The court said the ruling would be explained in an opinion to be issued later.The decision is a major victory for the state in a complex prosecution that has drawn national attention as a test of whether it is possible to win criminal convictions against police officers. The death of Mr. Gray, a 25-year-old black man who suffered a fatal spinal cord injury while in police custody last April, set off a wave of looting, arson and violence in Baltimore  the worst riots in the city since the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Officer Porter, charged with manslaughter and assault in the death, was tried last year, but the case ended in December with a hung jury. A judge scheduled a retrial for June while the state sought to compel Officer Porter to testify in the trials of the other officers. His lawyers fought the move, leading to delays in the other trials.Now we can get back to the business at hand, which is the trials of the police officers, said Douglas Colbert, a law professor at the University of Maryland who is supportive of the prosecution. Thats the most important thing here. We took a two-month hiatus, and now well be back in the courtroom.Precisely when the trials will begin, and in what order, remained unclear. The trial judge hearing the cases, Barry G. Williams of Baltimore City Circuit Court, has ordered prosecutors and defense lawyers not to talk about them. A court spokeswoman said Judge Williams would determine dates for the trials after he meets with lawyers in the near future.Tuesdays decision was the latest turn in cases that have riveted Baltimore and raised complicated legal questions. Lawyers for Officer Porter, who testified in his own defense, insisted that forcing him to testify in the trials of his fellow officers, even with limited immunity, would violate his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. They said a defendant had never before in Maryland been required to testify as a witness against co-defendants while his own trial was pending.But David Jaros, a law professor at the University of Baltimore who has been following the trials, said the Freddie Gray prosecutions present a highly unusual set of circumstances that make it easy for prosecutors to prove they are not using Officer Porters testimony in other trials against him.If you look really closely at it, this is the perfect case to use limited-use immunity, Mr. Jaros said. The defendant has testified at trial, hes made a videotaped statement, and the state has put all of their evidence forward in their own case when they tried Porter the first time. So we will be able to know what they had and what they got independently.Throughout the city, especially in Sandtown-Winchester, the West Baltimore neighborhood where Mr. Gray grew up, people have watched the criminal proceedings warily.Everyone is on pins and needles because there is no faith in the criminal justice system in the community, said Raymond Kelly of the No Boundaries Coalition, an advocacy group in West Baltimore that helped organize a cleanup effort after the unrest over Mr. Grays death.But this has been a year of change, where never before were officers indicted so quickly, he added. Will there be justice? Its gone to a grand jury, and theyre still walking the streets free.The decision by the Court of Appeals, Marylands equivalent of a Supreme Court, came as Mr. Kellys group, along with a sister organization, the West Baltimore Commission on Police Misconduct, released a 30-page report, based on interviews with residents, that tried to document and quantify the panic, fear and mistrust that residents feel toward the police.Working with a civil rights lawyer, Susan L. Burke, and Charles Cange, an ethnographer and research scientist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, the group held hearings and reached out to 1,500 people, 453 of whom shared accounts of what Mr. Kelly called police misconduct. None are named in the report; the authors said they also taped 39 in-depth interviews.The findings, in a city where law enforcement has had a long history of tense relations with African-American residents, were hardly surprising. Mr. Cange said the interviewers identified common themes, including perceptions of racism in law enforcement and feelings of resentment toward the police. The authors estimated that only a small percentage of respondents felt happiness or satisfaction in their dealings with the police while a majority experienced fear or anxiety and shame or humiliation.A spokesman for the Baltimore Police Department declined to comment.The citizens groups have shared their findings with the Department of Justice, which is investigating whether the Baltimore police engaged in a pattern of civil rights violations. The Justice Department declined to comment, but Mr. Kelly released a letter from Timothy D. Mygatt, the deputy chief of its special litigation section, acknowledging that the report sets forth significant concerns that will be considered as part of its inquiry.Ensuring that we hear from as many people as possible who are affected by policing in Baltimore is critical to our investigation, Mr. Mygatt wrote."}
{"text": "Alert the authorities! Theres a wayward nun on the loose in New York City, committing grand larceny eight times a week.I joke, of course  though that story would be a fun diversion from the onslaught of election coverage, no? The crimes are fictional, and are taking place at the Nederlander Theater on Broadway, where Jennifer Simard, playing a singing sister with an unquenchable yen for slot machines, is pilfering every scene she adorns in the delirious goof of a musical, Disaster!Perhaps petty larceny is a more appropriate charge, since this self-consciously silly spoof of the cheesy 1970s films that subjected assorted B-list stars to assorted calamities will never rank among the great musicals of our era  or even the great jukebox musicals of our era, a rather small demographic. But for anyone with a moist, albeit mortifying, affection for the oeuvre of that great auteur Irwin Allen (guilty), and the K-Tel era of pop music (guilty), Disaster! will provide a rush of giddy nostalgia thats just as pleasurable, at times, as the more substantial rewards of the musical theaters higher-reaching shows.True, if you have to Google either Allen, the producer of The Poseidon Adventure, which provides the basic template for the musical, or K-Tel, which churned out albums of soppy pop hits in collections relentlessly flogged in television ads, you might want to give this baby a skip. Try Hamilton  and good luck with that!Even so, Disaster!, written by Seth Rudetsky and Jack Plotnick, and directed by Mr. Plotnick, has such a sensational cast that musical lovers incognizant of the guilty pleasures of the movies being lampooned, and ignorant of the shows soundtrack  a staggering stack of 45s you loved to hate, or hated to love, or a little of both (Torn Between Two Lovers, Feelings, I Am Woman)  may still have plenty to savor.My spouse, whose ignorance of both the movies and the music in question is absolute (he was born in Turkey, after the brief vogue of disaster movies had waned), had a fine time, enjoying the daffiness of the performances and the willfully crackpot plotting.In addition to the heaven-sent Ms. Simard, the musical, which has had two prior Off Broadway runs, features tasty turns from familiar names: Faith Prince, sending up the warmhearted Jewish matron memorably portrayed by Shelley Winters in The Poseidon Adventure; Roger Bart, playing the sleazy owner of the floating disco-cum-casino in which the musical takes place; Rachel York, spangled in faux Bob Mackie and flinging around a fabulous Farrah wig, as the clubs headliner; and Kerry Butler as an intrepid reporter seeking to uncover the shoddy workmanship that causes havoc when an earthquake strikes the Hudson River, where the party boat floats.Lets briefly run through the ditsy plot. Mr. Rudetsky, perhaps the biggest and most famous Broadway fanboy in town, himself plays professor Ted Scheider, soi-disant noted disaster expert. He has reason to believe a geological event of mighty proportions may be about to occur, because hes been extracting some unusually heated sediment from, er, somewhere. (The opening number, introducing most of the characters, is performed to the throbbing Hot Stuff, originally made famous by Donna Summer.)Ted is most worried about this casino-disco, which is celebrating its grand opening and is stuffed to capacity, a further danger detected by Marianne (Ms. Butler), that nosy reporter who buttonholes the proprietor, Tony (Mr. Bart). His flirtatious evasions dont give her much help, requiring her to take him up on his invitation to join the party.Once aboard, shes surprised to meet an ex-fianc whom she dumped, Chad, a cater-waiter played by Adam Pascal, whose leather lungs are ripe for his big power ballad, the ghastly Without You. Lets all sing along: I cant live/If living is without you/I cant live/I cant give anymore. (Try getting that out of your head now. Apologies.)Also on board: Ms. Princes Shirley, resplendent in lurid Pucci swirls (the delicious costumes are by William Ivey Long), and her husband, Maury (Kevin Chamberlin, mostly wasted, alas); the washed-up disco queen Levora, played with seen-it-all weariness by Lacretta Nicole; and Ms. Yorks Jackie, who hopes to entice Tony into becoming stepfather to her twin tykes  a boy and girl played with ingenuity by Baylee Littrell, swapping genders within seconds.Mr. Rudetsky and Mr. Plotnick (along with Drew Geraci, who co-conceived the show and wrote additional material) take their time getting to the titular calamity, or rather series of calamities: after the earthquake comes a tidal wave that capsizes the casino. The first act tends toward waywardness, and while it runs just an hour, it feels longer. When youre camping it up, its best not to spend too much time vamping. (The quick-change bit with the twins, for instance, becomes a running gag thats running a marathon.)But the performances provide sufficient distraction. I will not soon forget the loopy sight of Ms. Princes Shirley tap-dancing her heart out (almost literally) to transmit messages in Morse code to passengers trapped a floor below her. The antic Mr. Bart practically springs an oil leak as the corrupt Tony, and Ms. Yorks lush junior-varsity version of Cher is amusingly vapid, all bugle beads for brains.But the breakout star is unquestionably Ms. Simard, playing Sister Mary Downy, a guitar-strumming nun who comes to the boat to convert the partygoers from lives of dissipation (Gambling is a sin, youre going to hell, have a nice day, she tells one), but ends up performing an orgasmic pas de deux with a Hawaii Five-O-themed slot machine, to the tune of the disco classic Never Can Say Goodbye. (Connoisseurs will recognize Sister Mary as a nod to Helen Reddys singing nun in Airport 1975.)Ms. Simard mines the sisters pious nerdiness for delicious comedy, but really comes into her own when Sister Mary succumbs to her gambling addiction and makes mad love to that machine. No more proof needed that sinning is far more entertaining, and much funnier, than saintliness.By Seth Rudetsky and Jack Plotnick; concept created by Mr. Rudetsky and Drew Geraci; additional material by Mr. Geraci; directed by Mr. Plotnick; choreography by JoAnn M.

{"text": "Join us for live updates of the March 8 primaries.Voters go to the polls in four states on Tuesday, with Michigan the biggest prize for both parties. Donald J. Trump seeks to strengthen his position as the Republican front-runner, while his rivals look to slow his drive toward the nomination. For the Democrats, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont faces a crucial test in his upstart campaign to derail Hillary Clinton. Here are some of the things we will be watchingin the contests in Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan and Mississippi.Mr. Trump had a rough week. He faced attacks from the party establishment and criticism for his debate performance on Thursday before barely outpacing Senator Ted Cruz of Texas on Saturday in Kentucky and Louisiana, and losing to him in Kansas and Maine, where Mr. Trump was considered a favorite.But it is not clear whether he struggled to win because he had lost ground or because anti-Trump voters had consolidated around Mr. Cruz. Mr. Trumps share of the vote on Saturday was roughly in line with what he had won on Super Tuesday; Mr. Cruz finished with a far higher share of the vote than his Super Tuesday total.The outcome on Tuesday could be telling. If Mr. Trump were to replicate his Super Tuesday performance, he would take about 35 percent of the vote in Michigan and 42 percent in Mississippi. If he were to lose significant ground from last weeks vote, it could present an opening for one of his rivals.It seems clear that Mr. Cruz benefited on Saturday from the somewhat sudden slide of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Mr. Rubio managed only 17 percent in the Kansas caucuses on Saturday  and that was his high-water mark across four states for the day. He bounced back with a decisive victory in Puerto Rico on Sunday, but that might not stop him from dropping in the states with the two largest delegate hauls on Tuesday: Michigan and Mississippi.Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio has devoted substantial time to Michigan, and, according to local Republican officials backing Mr. Rubio, he has cut into the core of Mr. Rubios support: upscale, suburban Republicans. Mr. Rubio also faces the prospect of losing similar voters in Mississippi to Mr. Kasich, while anti-Trump conservatives drift to Mr. Cruz there.The good news for Mr. Rubio is that he could fare much better in the two other states that vote on Tuesday: Idaho and Hawaii. But as any West Coast Heisman Trophy contender knows, late-night success can often be missed by a press corps faced with Eastern time zone deadlines.Though Mr. Cruz benefited from Mr. Rubios weak performance in Kentucky and Louisiana, it is not clear whether he can make the same gains in Michigan. It is a blue state with relatively few evangelical voters, and Mr. Cruz has struggled so far in such states.Instead, Mr. Kasich could be the candidate who benefits from Mr. Rubios struggles. He is a relatively moderate governor from a neighboring state, and polls show he has moved into a tight race with Mr. Cruz for second place.The race for second is a test for both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich as each looks to present himself as the strongest Trump alternative. The second half of the primary season includes many Democratic-leaning states, like California, New Jersey and New York. A strong second-place showing in Michigan would ameliorate concerns about Mr. Cruzs ability to compete in blue states; if Mr. Kasich were to fare better, it would set him up for a strong showing in his home state next week.On paper, Michigan should be a good state for Mr. Sanders. It is a white, working-class state that has been ravaged by outsourcing and ought to be receptive to Mr. Sanderss message on economic issues. It is also a fairly liberal state, with big college towns like Ann Arbor and East Lansing. The state is whiter than the nation as a whole, and black voters  who have turned out in droves for Mrs. Clinton in the South  make up roughly the same share of the electorate there as they do nationally.The burden for Mr. Sanders in Michigan is even higher because he needs to make up for losses in the first part of the primary season with even stronger showings going forward. The polls suggest that Mrs. Clinton is on track for a decisive victory, so Mr. Sanders needs a surprise win to show he still has a path of his own.Mr. Trump rolled through the Deep South on Super Tuesday, winning every state in the region, some of them in landslides. In Alabama, he routed his nearest competitor, Mr. Cruz, by more than 22 percentage points. But when the race came to Louisiana on Saturday, the outcome looked markedly different. Mr. Trump beat Mr. Cruz by about four percentage points, and he fared far worse among voters who cast ballots on Saturday than those who voted early.The Mississippi primary will offer some insight into whether Mr. Trump is slipping with some of the partys most conservative voters. Demographically, the state resembles its two neighbors, which had such different results. It is also filled with Christian conservative voters: 83 percent of those who cast ballots in the 2012 Republican presidential primary called themselves evangelicals. The good news for Mr. Trump is that, unlike Louisianas primary, Mississippis contest is not limited to Republicans, so he could benefit from the Democrats and independents who have been drawn to his candidacy. But if Mr. Trump is starting to slip with Christian conservatives  whether because of his innuendo about his manhood, Mr. Cruzs growing strength, or both  it could be evident here.Candidates must meet a minimum percentage of the vote in certain states to receive any delegates, which are allocated proportionally in the Republican race until March 15 (starting then, states can decide whether to hold winner-take-all or proportional contests). The more candidates who meet the threshold, the more delegates are scattered  and the less likely it is that any candidate can reach the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the convention.Three of the four states where Republicans are voting on Tuesday have thresholds: To win delegates, a candidate must receive at least 20 percent of the vote in Idaho, and at least 15 percent in Michigan and Mississippi.The two candidates most in danger of not reaching the minimum are Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich. Mr. Rubio learned how much that can hurt on Super Tuesday, when he failed to meet the threshold in three states and was denied all but a handful of delegates. If Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich are shut out entirely on Tuesday, it will push the Republican contest closer to a two-man race."}
{"text": "LONDON  An appeals court on Tuesday denied a request by Tom Hayes, a former trader at Citigroup and UBS, to ask Britains highest court to review his conviction in August for conspiring to manipulate a global benchmark interest rate known as Libor.Mr. Hayes, who is imprisoned and serving his sentence, was the first person to go to trial in Britain and to be convicted on criminal charges related to the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor.In December, the Court of Appeal declined to overturn Mr. Hayess conviction, but reduced his sentence to 11 years in prison from an original term of 14 years.On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal refused his request to have the Supreme Court, Britains highest court, review the case, a spokesman for the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the criminal case, said on Tuesday.A lawyer for Mr. Hayes did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.The decision makes it much more difficult for Mr. Hayes to challenge his conviction, as criminal cases must be certified by a lower court that there is a point of law of general public importance to be argued on appeal before the Supreme Court.He is expected to ask the Criminal Case Review Commission, which examines miscarriages of justice, to examine his case. The independent body can refer criminal cases back to the appellate court for review.The appeals court decision came more than a month after a jury in London acquitted six former brokers of charges that they helped Mr. Hayes manipulate Libor.A half-decade-long investigation into the manipulation of Libor has led to billions of dollars in fines and has damaged the reputations of some of the worlds biggest banks, including Barclays, the Royal Bank of Scotland and UBS.A third trial in London of others accused of manipulating Libor is expected to begin this year.The first trial in the United States of people accused of rigging Libor ended in the conviction in November of two former London-based traders.The Serious Fraud Office had accused Mr. Hayes of being a ringleader among more than a dozen traders in what authorities said was a brazen scheme to manipulate Libor, which helps determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars in loans. He was accused of misconduct engaged in from 2006 to 2010.Mr. Hayess lawyers had argued that he was open about his conduct and did not believe at the time that he was acting dishonestly.To set Libor and other rates, banks submit the rates at which they would be prepared to lend money to one another, on an unsecured basis, in various currencies and at varying maturities.The evidence against Mr. Hayes included 82 hours of voluntary testimony that prosecutors said he provided to the Serious Fraud Office over five months. The authorities said he admitted to rigging rates and provided testimony against many former friends and colleagues, including his half brother.Mr. Hayes testified during the trial that he decided to cooperate with British authorities because he feared being extradited to the United States, where he is also facing criminal charges, and wanted to remain close to his wife and child.After providing the voluntary testimony to British authorities, Mr. Hayes stopped cooperating with prosecutors in 2013 and chose to plead not guilty to the charges in Britain."}
{"text": "Fearing that a continuing dispute will prevent 900,000 local Comcast customers from watching regular-season Yankee games, the Yes Network is beginning a campaign Wednesday to try to persuade affected fans to switch to providers like Verizon Fios and DirecTV.Were telling people that this isnt going to settle, Tracy Dolgin, the president of the YES Network, said in a telephone interview. Hope is not a strategy. You have to find another provider.Comcast dropped YES from systems in New Jersey, southern Connecticut and Scranton, Pa., in mid-November, depriving customers of Brooklyn Nets games and various Yankee and Nets programs. But with the baseball season a month away, YES said it was appropriate to put pressure on Comcast with television, radio, outdoor, transit and print ads and messages on social media. Other networks have adopted a similar strategy during an impasse. YES has set up a website to argue its case and suggest alternate providers.Were already into spring training, Dolgin said. Theres a real chance of missing both opening day and the season. To me this is a huge thing.He added that YES and Comcast operated without a contract for much of last year, and that Comcast had agreed to a price to continue carrying the network, then dropped it.They paid it until the dead of night in November, then took it off, he said.Comcast tells a different but familiar story. YES is much too expensive, a price that is not justified, Comcast said, given the networks minimal viewership.YESs monthly subscriber fee last year was $5.93, but it has dropped this year to $5.36, according to SNL Kagan, a media research firm.The real chutzpah here is that theyre wrapping themselves in protecting the consumer, Dolgin said.Comcast also said that 21st Century Fox, which owns 80 percent of YES, was trying to use the talks over YES to add subscribers to other Fox networks like FS1, FS2 and Fox Business.Fox is using YES Network to benefit its other networks at the expense of Yankee fans and our customers nationwide, said John Demming, a Comcast spokesman.YES faced a major battle at its inception in 2002 with Cablevision, which had previously televised Yankee games on its MSG Network. Cablevision refused to carry YES for a full year, claiming it would pay a subscriber fee of only 55 cents a month, less than one-quarter of what YES was seeking. The impasse was resolved through intervention by Eliot Spitzer, then New Yorks attorney general.Ive been here since 2004 and we havent been off the air with any operators since Ive been here until this dispute, Dolgin said. And how we got here leads me to believe it wont be settled.An even more extended fight is taking place in Los Angeles where, for what could be a third season, the network created by Time Warner Cable to carry Dodgers games is not available in most of the market. The continuing impasse will deprive many fans of seeing Vin Scully in what is apparently his final season as the voice of the Dodgers."}
{"text": "Here it is, a little soup dumpling in its swirled debutante skirt, looking so innocent, until you bite its neck and the steam roils out.Let it rage. Its a last gasp, before you suck up the broth within.Nearly everything on the menu at Yaso Tangbao in Downtown Brooklyn summons up the streets of Shanghai: those soup dumplings like sleeping volcanoes, waiting for a trigger; giant shaggy pork-belly meatballs, called lions heads, majestic and mystifyingly airy; a cool, monochromatic huddle of chicken thigh, poached and submerged in Shaoxing rice wine, that tastes gentle, with vague allusions to mushrooms and licorice (though if you eat too much, it may make your head swim).Then there is sauerkraut, tucked into two tightly wound spring rolls, darkly bronzed and glistening, giving no hint of their unorthodox interior. It is an excellent innovation: Often spring rolls are dipped in vinegar, but here the pickled flavor is already inside, bracing, alongside its precursor, fresh Napa cabbage, and ground chicken.Zongxing Tu, the chef, worked in Germany in the 1980s before coming to New York and making his name as a master of soup dumplings at the first Joes Shanghai in Flushing, Queens.But his sauerkraut spring rolls taste less German than Chinese  perhaps because sauerkraut may be traced back two millenniums to the building of the Great Wall, when laborers fortified themselves with fermented cabbage. Later, legend has it, the sour vegetable caught Genghis Khans fancy, and his hordes bore it west.Mr. Tu, 58, is the resident yaso (uncle, in Shanghainese dialect), a mentor to his 26-year-old partners, Chi Zhang, Kevin Gu and Chongwu Du. All four grew up in Shanghai; the young men went to high school together and came to the United States to study, respectively, at Brandeis, Georgetown and Brown.They gave up jobs in banking and international affairs to open Yaso Tangbao in October, next to a Papa Johns, on a cluttered strip not known for authentic Chinese cooking.The only nod to heritage in the semi-industrial space is a wall of vintage ads from 1920s and 30s Shanghai, an era of carefully crimped hair and ruby lips. You will have time to ponder them as you wait to pounce on a seat at one of the long wooden communal tables. Orders are placed at a counter in the back, where you may witness your soup dumplings being made in a glassed-in room.It is hard to stop talking about those dumplings. (Tangbao is the general category of soup dumplings; the versions made here are best known as xiao long bao, little basket buns.) Their skins may not be the thinnest in town, but the touch of doughiness is just enough to protect the broth and cut the richness of the pork  or, better yet, pork and blue crab, with its memories of sea shallows and eelgrass.I could go on about the cold noodles, too, exemplars of their kind, slippery rather than sticky, tasting as much of sesame as of peanuts. And a braised beef noodle soup, suffused with star anise, which had more flavor the deeper I got.And kao fu, rough hunks of pliant, protein-rich wheat gluten, whose Mandarin name translates as the delightfully texture-specific dough tendon. Soy sauce and sugar leak from its pores; black wood-ear mushrooms add sponginess, while peanuts add salt and crunch.Pork buns come not with loose tongues of lacquered pork belly but with pork ground and sealed inside, along with some of the pork-stock gelatin otherwise reserved for soup dumplings. They are sized to fit in your palm and slightly sweet, with a crisp patch on the bottom and a freckling of black sesame seeds on top. The ratio of dough to meat is exact.It is good to strategize a palate cleanser or two among your dishes, like a sweet-leaning cabbage salad and cucumbers that seem to have swallowed whole cloves of garlic. Both will leave you revived, if perhaps not quite ready for a near dessert of fried sticky rice under slashes of mayonnaise infused with orange juice.Better to end with the demure pumpkin cakes, dusted with coconut and too light to be quite of this earth."}
{"text": "RIO DE JANEIRO   Marcelo Odebrecht, the former chief executive of Brazils largest construction company, was convicted of corruption and money laundering on Tuesday. He was sentenced to more than 19 years in prison by the Brazilian judge who is leading the wide-ranging investigation into corruption at the state-owned oil company, Petrobras.Testimony in the overall inquiry, which has shaken the countrys political and business elite, has shown that executives at Petrobras accepted large bribes from companies and channeled some of that money to political figures and the governing Workers Party.The judge, Sergio Moro, in a 234-page decision, said Mr. Odebrecht had paid about $35 million in bribes to officials at Petrobras and had used overseas accounts to launder the money and make many of the illicit payments. Corruption with the payment of bribes of over hundreds of millions of reals, which has the consequence of draining the public coffers, merits special condemnation, Judge Moro wrote.Mr. Odebrechts company, Odebrecht SA, was founded by his grandfather in 1944. It now operates in 27 countries, including Cuba, Venezuela, China and the United States, and employs more than 250,000 people. It won contracts to work on many of the stadiums built for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and has worked on many construction projects for the Summer Olympics to be held here this August, including the athletes village and the Olympic Park.The charges against Mr. Odebrecht related solely to the companys contracts with Petrobras. Judge Moro said Mr. Odebrechts company had worked with other companies to systematically rig the bidding on Petrobras projects since 2006. Mr. Odebrecht had close ties with President Dilma Rousseff and her mentor and predecessor, former president Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, who was questioned last week in connection with the Petrobras investigation.Three other people, including other former Odebrecht executives, were sentenced on Tuesday. In all, 67 people have been convicted in the investigation, according to the federal prosecutors office in Curitiba. The investigation began two years ago, and there appears to be no end in sight.The length of the sentence imposed on Mr. Odebrecht is highly unusual for a business leader, many analysts said.I cant remember any other case in Brazil with as harsh a sentence against a business leader, said Mauricio Santoro, a professor of political science at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. He said it would send a message to the business community about corruption and impunity.Mr. Odebrechts sentence might influence the rest of the investigation, persuading other business executives who have been arrested to strike plea arrangements with prosecutors. This will give a big incentive for other executives to cooperate with justice, Professor Santoro said.The newspaper O Globo reported on Tuesday, before the judge released the verdict in the case against Mr. Odebrecht, that the former head of a large construction company, Leo Pinheiro, and Mr. Odebrecht were interested in plea agreements.Mr. Odebrechts lawyer, Nabor Bulhes, said the sentence was unjust and a result of a grave judiciary error. He contended that the evidence did not support Judge Moros ruling. Mr. Odebrecht is expected to appeal."}

{"text": "Even before revelations that the reporter Erin Andrews was secretly videotaped naked by a stalker in a hotel room in 2008, female sportscasters understood how frightening obsessed fans can be.Andrea Kremer recalled that in 1988, while she was working for NFL Films, she was in a hotel room when a man called late at night as she was falling asleep.He started saying all these things he wanted to do to me, and it scared the living hell out of me, said Ms. Kremer, who is now with NFL Network and HBO Sports. I hung up, called downstairs and said: I got a really threatening call. Can you trace it? They said it was coming from inside the hotel. Then he called back  it was so chilling and terrifying. I was shaking. My heart was beating fast.After another call to the front desk, she said, the hotel stationed a security guard outside her door.I told the men on my crew, and they were livid, she said. They said: Why didnt you call us? We would have slept on the floor.Female sportscasters have unparalleled reach in an age of round-the-clock sports broadcasting and the widespread dissemination of their work across social media. There are more of them now than ever, across multiple channels and websites.But the flip side is unwanted attention from a male-dominated audience that can include fans who get uncomfortably close, or even stalkers.Female newscasters and celebrities have long faced harassment and threats  one newscaster said in 2012 that she had had to quit her job in St. Louis after repeated threats from a stalker. But some sportscasters work in highly visible and potentially vulnerable places like stadiums and arenas, where they are close to passionate fans, many of them men.The sportscasters routinely take precautions like asking hotel clerks not to say their name loudly when checking in, refusing to step into elevators if they see glaring male eyes, and opting for private transportation late at night, to avoid the flock of people who often gather outside studios, innocently or not. Some check to make sure the eyehole on their hotel door has not been tampered with, as it was in the case of Ms. Andrews, who at the time worked for ESPN and is now with Fox Sports. Several female sportscasters described their concerns in an article published by Sports Illustrated this week.In one of the most disturbing episodes faced by a female sportscaster, a man used a hacksaw to alter the peepholes of Ms. Andrewss hotel rooms in Nashville and Columbus, Ohio. Jurors on Monday found the man, Michael David Barrett, and the companies that manage the Nashville Marriott responsible for invading Ms. Andrewss privacy and awarded her $55 million in damages.Jessica Mendoza, an analyst on ESPNs Sunday Night Baseball, said that what had happened to Ms. Andrews had made her wonder about taking more than minor precautions, like closing the blinds in hotel rooms.You think about all the times youre in a room  and how scary that someone could see me in there, she said.But less egregious encounters can also leave female sportscasters unsettled and almost always on guard.Ill try to avoid ever being in the hall of a hotel by myself, said Kim Jones, a reporter for NFL Network. And Ill allow whoever is behind me to pass me before I put my card or key in the door. You have to be so aware because unfortunately that one time out of 10,000, something can happen.Alyssa Roenigk, a reporter for ESPN the Magazine who also appears on the air, primarily covering action sports like the X Games, said she had rarely given her security much thought. For years, she usually walked from venues to her hotel, even late at night. But as she began to do more television and was recognized more often, she was told by her bosses to start taking the courtesy car provided by the network.At first I thought I was getting special treatment, and I dont want special treatment, Ms. Roenigk said. Its not special treatment. Its being safe.Jamie Little of Fox Sports, who primarily covers Nascar and other motorsports, said: Just last week, I got on an elevator, and there were some race fans in there, and they were drinking, and it made me a little nervous. And they were kind of watching what floor I was going to, so I pressed the wrong floor. So I go to the wrong floor, get off the elevator, wait for them to go and get back on.In another instance, she said, she was on an airport shuttle on her way to pick up a rental car when a man approached her. She was still not sure if he was an ardent fan or something else.This guy turns right into me and says, Hey, Jamie, so you going to so-and-so today? she recalled. I was like, Whoa, hey, well, Im here for Nascar. And he kept trying to make small talk. I went down another escalator, and when I looked over, he was literally standing there staring at me, on his phone.That kind of stuff makes you worry, she continued. You want to give people the benefit of the doubt. Yeah, Im on TV; its not a big deal. But you have to watch the mannerisms, the body language, the constant following you as they try to ask questions. I tend to be overly nice to people. When weird things happen, I honestly kind of forget about it because its your job and Ive got to get on a plane the next week.Laura Okmin, a sideline reporter for N.F.L. games on Fox, dealt with a stalker in the mid-1990s when she was working at a TV station in Chattanooga, Tenn. The man became angry when she did not respond to letters he had sent her and gifts he had dropped off for her. Eventually, police officers escorted her home several times, and security was provided at events that she covered. Later, a man kept calling her at every hotel she checked into.Ms. Okmin mentions these experiences at seminars she holds for aspiring female sportscasters through her company, Galvanize.I tell them that sometimes someone will be lovely and pay you a great compliment, but if you dont respond the right way in person or on social media, they turn angry and belligerent, she said. Nowadays, it can be 24/7 with all the ways they can come at you.After the jurys decision, Ms. Andrews was thankful for the encouragement she said she had received from other victims of harassment, and she suggested the cases outcome would improve safety.Ive been honored by all the support from victims around the world, she said on Twitter. Their outreach has helped me be able to stand up and hold accountable those whose job it is to protect everyones safety, security and privacy."}
{"text": "Prescription drug spending in Medicare has been rising fast, but it is not completely clear what policies are driving the increases. The Obama administration hopes to find ways to control costs by testing different approaches to paying for the drugs.The experiments would apply to a class of drugs covered under Medicare Part B that are administered in doctors offices and hospitals to treat cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions. The government and the programs beneficiaries spent nearly $21 billion on these medicines in 2013, 29 percent more than in 2007, according to a Government Accountability Office report published in November. A big part of the reason spending has shot up is that drug prices have been going up faster than inflation or overall medical costs.Doctors and hospitals often have a financial incentive to pick more expensive medicines even when cheaper alternatives might be as effective. That is because Medicare pays doctors and hospitals the average selling price of Part B medicines plus 6 percent. As a result, a medical provider will get $60 for administering a $1,000 drug and $6 for injecting a $100 medicine. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services wants to test what would happen if it instead paid providers 2.5 percent of average selling prices plus $16.80 per drug per day. That should in theory reduce the financial incentive to pick the higher-cost drug.The government would also try to determine what happens when it reduces or eliminates the 20 percent co-payment that Medicare beneficiaries are required to pay for Part B drugs. Since some patients cannot afford co-pays, some doctors prescribe cheaper drugs that may be less effective and that can actually increase Medicare spending if patients take longer to recover. Another test would provide higher payments for drugs based on how effectively they treat illnesses like heart disease or cancer.Not surprisingly, some medical groups and pharmaceutical companies say these tests could hurt Medicare beneficiaries by limiting their access to certain drugs. But every test the administration is proposing leaves prescription decisions to doctors. And the tests would not start until medical groups, drug makers and the public have a chance to comment on the proposal.Republican lawmakers like Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, Representative Kevin Brady of Texas and Representative Fred Upton of Michigan are already slamming the proposal as an example of unelected bureaucrats making decisions behind closed doors. Under the law that governs Medicare, public officials are directed to conduct experiments that will help improve care, increase efficiency and reduce costs. Besides, bureaucrats came up with the current payment structure because, after all, Medicare is a government program.The administrations proposal is a reasonable attempt to get a handle on rising medical costs.

In addition to the forged Police Department cards, the authorities said, he had a fake Correction Department identification card and a fake New York police shield, as well as flare guns, a bulletproof vest from the Jersey City Police Department, metal knuckles, police scanners and $42,800 in cash.The apartment had been turned into an arsenal of deadly weapons, Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney, said in a statement.It is very disturbing to find the amount of guns and ammunition stockpiled in an apartment in a residential community, Mr. Brown added.Mr. Bergman was charged with 32 counts of criminal possession of a weapon, as well as multiple counts related to possessing the fake law enforcement identification, the authorities said. He was also charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance, a bottle of Xanax.After he was arrested on Tuesday, Mr. Bergman was hospitalized and later released, though the authorities did not explain why. He had not appeared in court as of Wednesday night; it was unclear if he had a lawyer."}
{"text": "PARIS  A long, strange season it has been. One filled with ambiguity, rumor and infighting (Show now, sell now! Over my dead body!), that aside from some discernible trends  an elongated silhouette; leopard; the continuing popularity of lingerie dresses; the haute puffa jacket  has left most questions as yet unresolved.Who will run Dior? Dont know. What about Lanvin? The latest name whispered in the wings is Bouchra Jarrar. Is Hedi Slimane staying at Saint Laurent? Your guess is as good as mine. Do shows matter, or is it all about Instagram now?Ah, for that we have a response. Social media makes people think everything is accessible said Maria Grazia Chiuri, a creative director of Valentino, backstage before the show. She was standing next to Pierpaolo Piccioli, her co-creative director, both wearing black trouser suits and white shirts (Mr. Piccioli also had on a black tie; Ms. Chiuri, a handful of rings) and talking about performance art. Which for them is a synonym for a show.But what social media cannot provide is a sense of the emotion of a group experience, she continued. We think our job is not just to do things you can consume, because you can see and love beauty without buying it. It is to give that shared happening. So they did.Against piano music by John Cage and Philip Glass played live on a baby grand set amid the runway came an ode to dancers past: Merce Cunningham and Martha Graham, Pina Bausch and Diaghilev. Some of it was wearable (pristine white shirts wrapped like a warm-up sweater, with a dark ribbon at the waist and ribs; pleated schoolgirl skirts and exacting navy coats), and some of it less so (a nude suede dress with draped spaghetti-strap bodice, the skirt sliced into studded ribbons to play with, and expose, the legs; a crinoline tutu). Though that was not the point. The effect  material doing fouetts and chasss around the body  was.The theme gave the designers leave to express their penchant for couture-level ornamentation via floating layers of tulle embroidered with clouds, or folkloric runes, or feathered wings. Its beautiful, no question, but its also beginning to seem almost rote. (Oh, look: another amazing bit of beading; uh-huh; whats next?) The best pieces had the strict perfection of silk jersey, shirred at the shoulders and prepped for an arabesque. Subconsciously, they made you point your toes.But for that, you had, as they say, to be there. In the end, Paris was replete with these grace notes; felicitous, if occasionally head-spinning, reminders of why this circus exists.They started with the surreal  Giambattista Vallis spun-sugar ode to the Swiss Alps in a fluffy fur, flowers and lederhosen fantasy at Moncler Gamme Rouge, complete with pretend snow and real cow bells. They moved to social commentary: Miuccia Pradas high/low mlange of the bourgeois and the bohemian at Miu Miu with denim jackets done up like evening wear, cotton boxers, tapestry maxi skirts, tweed jodhpurs, little velvet dresses and bombshell brocades (and shorts). And they ultimately reached the sublime: Iris van Herpens 18 stations of the future.Eighteen women faced 18 olfactory light screens, rectangular panels that refracted the light and reflected and distorted the woman (and dress) behind, doubling her image and transforming the audience into both voyeur and backstage visitor, and allowing the woman to dance, as it were, with herself. Thats not to mention the dress she might be wearing: a familiar neat little sheath, rendered extraordinary by technology and imagination.One lacy spider web was laser-cut from wool; another knitted in micro-pleats from steel and wool to create a dense, swirling exoskeleton; another composed of glistening 3-D printed, transparent laser-cut hexagons (5,000 of them) as airy and alluring as soap bubbles. Yet another was made from intensely light tulle fused with iridescent strips so the fabric looked like liquid mercury. Why Ms. van Herpens name is not often mentioned in contention for one of the myriad creative director jobs available is one of fashions great mysteries.If her clothes were singular, however, it was at Louis Vuitton that things got, literally, monumental. The artistic director Nicolas Ghesquire constructed three enormous geometric shapes  a sphere, a square, a pyramid  and filled them with the ruins of a glittering Atlantis. The better to excavate not just his own aesthetic history (and that of his house), but that of the collections thus far.Columns covered in shattered mirrors reflected a story of motor sports and the military told in patent leather and wool. The rise of the machines was woven into graphic knit bodysuits and dresses, and ivory silk slip dresses came paired with leather breastplates or etched with sequined scratches, like lace or mud (it was hard to tell), a train suspended from the narrowest strap on one side. Road warriors were spliced with romance and a bit of the weird  a combination that also pretty much describes the underlying genome of the womens wear month.While it wasnt mythic, it did have its moments."}
{"text": "The huge polling miss in Michigan was a cautionary tale: for all its excellence, FiveThirtyEight is only as good as the polls, which at least this time were way, way off. Its too soon to dismiss them, but not too soon to explore other approaches, which is what Alan Abramowitz has just done. Using data for the Dem contests so far, he estimates a simple relationship based on just two factors  nonwhite share of the population, and north versus south  that accounts for the results quite well  and Michigan is not an outlier.If this model is right  and bear in mind that until Michigan polls were doing pretty well, so it may be a special case  next Tuesday wont go as well for Clinton as the polls predict, with Sanders quite possibly winning three states. Its important to remember, however, that Democratic delegates are allocated more or less proportionately, so that we would still be looking at a substantial Clinton gain in delegates. My back of the envelope says that she would widen her lead by 80-100 if Alans model calls it right.What about later? There arent many more Southern states. On the other hand, after Tuesday almost half the pledged delegates will have been chosen, and to close the gap Sanders would have to win big in what remains. The back of my envelope says that he would need to win the rest of the primaries by something like a 14-16 point margin, which seems unlikely. So even with this model, Clinton remains a strong favorite.But this could go on for a long, long time. And people who say that its good for the Democratic party might want to look at the Sanders Twitter feed, which is, if you ask me, getting pretty ugly in a way the Clinton feed hasnt.Well know a lot more after next Tuesday."}
{"text": "We as a society derided the Roman Catholic Church as an accessory to child sexual abuse, and we lambasted Penn State for similar offenses.Yet we as a society are complicit or passive in a similar way, by allowing a popular website called Backpage.com to be used to arrange child rape. Consider what happened to a girl Ill call Natalie, who was trafficked into the sex industry in Seattle at age 15.It was every parents nightmare, Natalies mother, Nacole, told me. It can happen to any parent. Fifteen-year-olds dont make the best choices. I dropped her off at school in the morning, I was expecting to pick her up after track practice in the afternoon, and then I didnt see her for 108 days. The girl ran off to a bus station, was found by a pimp, and within days was being sold for sex on Backpage.Backpage has classified ads for everything from antiques to boats, but it makes its money on escort ads. It has about 80 percent of the U.S. market for online sex ads in America, mostly for consenting adults but many also for women who are forcibly trafficked or for underage girls. Children in at least 47 states have been sold on Backpage, by one aid groups count.We were an everyday, average family, Nacole said. Our children were involved in sports. She played the violin. She was on the soccer team. And she made a stupid decision one day that forever changed her life. And Backpage facilitated it.The girl was eventually rescued by the police, but by then she had been beaten and threatened by her pimp and endured innumerable rapes. Shes forever changed, her mom said. Her siblings are forever changed. Today she struggles with life.If there were a major American website openly selling heroin or anthrax, there would be an outcry. Yet we Americans tolerate a site like Backpage.com that is regularly used to peddle children. We avert our eyes, and the topic tends not to come up in polite society.I had no idea how much juvenile trafficking goes on until my family became a victim of it, Nacole said.Thousands of children are trafficked for sex each year in the United States, but there are no solid numbers. What is clear is only that its a big problem that gets minimal attention; its essentially never mentioned in the current political campaign.Yet a few forces are coming together to put pressure on Backpage. One is a  lawsuit in Washington State against Backpage by Natalie and two other girls who at age 13 were also sold on the website; one of the 13-year-olds said that she was raped 20 times a day.Another is decisive action by credit card companies to stop processing fees for sex ads on Backpage, disrupting its business model.Then there is the prospect that the Senate this month will adopt a Contempt of Congress resolution, the first by the Senate in 21 years (the last involved the Whitewater investigation), and this time its bipartisan and the target is Backpage. The aim is to force Backpage to comply with subpoenas from the Senates Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which is looking into the companys role in sex trafficking.Senator Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who leads the panel, told me that he expects the Senate to vote next week on the resolution and he doesnt know of anyone planning to vote against it.At a time when Congress seems gridlocked and dysfunctional, its nice to see the Senate moving in a bipartisan way to address an issue that affects Americas most vulnerable.The subcommittee has already uncovered disturbing information about Backpage, including the way it edits ads to reduce law enforcement scrutiny and does not retain photo data that could be used to find missing children. And Senate investigators uncovered an instruction to the Backpage staff that seemed to suggest erring on the side of letting girls be sold: only delete [ads] if you really very sure person is underage.The Senate panel found that Backpage was worth hundreds of millions of dollars and in 2014 had an Ebitda margin, a measure of profitability, of 82 percent, compared with an average of 9.3 percent for online services companies.Yiota Souras of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children notes that the issue is not adult prostitution or sex among consenting adults: Thats totally removed from what were focusing on here, which is children sold to be raped.Whatever we think about the presidential race, whatever our political party, we should be able to agree to act to stop the exploitation of children. Its wrong when the Catholic Church hierarchy looks the other way, when Penn State averts its eyes, and also when we as a society do the same thing."}

{"text": "The head of Volkswagens American operations, a central figure in the carmakers effort to repair relations with dealers and customers after an emissions scandal, unexpectedly stepped down on Wednesday.The sudden departure of the executive, Michael Horn, adds to the strategic uncertainty for Volkswagen, particularly in the United States, where sales have been plummeting and dealers have been grumbling.After being named to the top spot in the United States two years ago, Mr. Horn played a crucial role in rebuilding Volkswagens relationship with its dealership network, gaining the support of the sales force on the ground. Car dealers in the United States had long complained about the lack of support they received from the companys managers in Germany.The fraud further tested the relationship, with Volkswagen admitting that 11 million diesel cars worldwide contained a so-called cheat device that effectively lowered emissions when the exhaust was being tested. Mr. Horn tried to soothe American dealers, offering to reimburse them for the cost of holding onto diesel cars and providing extra incentives for selling gasoline-powered vehicles.Now, dealers are wondering about the direction of management. Alan Brown, who is the chairman of the Volkswagen National Dealer Advisory Council and runs two Volkswagen dealerships in Texas, said Mr. Horns departure was a serious blow.We are troubled watching the mismanagement of this scandal from Germany, and how it may impact the ultimate decisions by the authorities in the United States, the Volkswagen dealers association said in a statement. This change in management can only serve to put the company at more risk, not less.The departure of Mr. Horn is the latest in a string of executive changes at Volkswagen since the scandal. The companys chief executive resigned last year. A newly named head of North American operations left shortly after that group was reorganized.The departure of Mr. Horn, which the company said was reached by mutual agreement, is effective immediately. The company offered few details, except to say that Mr. Horn was leaving to pursue other opportunities.Mr. Horn will be replaced by Hinrich J. Woebcken, who was recently named head of the North American region and chairman of Volkswagen Group of America.The Volkswagen leadership hammer continues to fall, said Akshay Anand, an analyst at Kelley Blue Book, who noted that Mr. Horn had many allies among Volkswagens dealers in the United States. It will be interesting to see if Woebcken can continue that, and more importantly, if he can help VW navigate through its crisis.In the early days of the emissions scandal, Mr. Horn was the companys public face, repeatedly apologizing to customers and testifying before Congress about the problem. Shortly after Volkswagen admitted the fraud, Mr. Horn said at a congressional hearing that the company was working tirelessly to develop remedies for the affected vehicles.Months later, Volkswagen has still not come up with a recall plan that would fix the problem and satisfy the Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates vehicle emissions in the United States. Investigators in the United States and Europe are also trying to answer basic questions about the fraud and who was responsible.Volkswagen has said the fraud was limited to a small group of people. But prosecutors in Germany said on Tuesday that they had expanded their investigation, raising the number of suspects to 17, from six. (While German privacy rules do not allow suspects to be named, they do not include current or former members of the companys management board, according to a spokesman for the prosecutors office.)Company executives knew about the potential emissions problems more than a year before Volkswagen publicly admitted the fraud to regulators. But in talks with American regulators the carmaker initially denied the existence of a cheat device.In testimony in October, Mr. Horn said he knew of a potential emissions problem in the spring of 2014. At the time, he said he was told that the companys engineers were working to resolve the problem.Mr. Horn, 54, who has worked for more than 25 years at Volkswagen, took the top job in North America in January 2014. Before that, he was the companys global head of after sales.In the United States, he worked to mend relations between the company and its dealer network, which had become increasingly tense.Until Mr. Horn was appointed, dealers complained that their voices were not being heard by the leadership in Germany. They warned that the overly ambitious goal of selling 800,000 cars by 2018 could not be met because Volkswagens lineup was not suited to the American market.To help assuage those concerns, Volkswagen said that it would produce at its plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., a new midsize sport utility vehicle aimed at American consumers. The new vehicle, expected to be ready this year, is part of a $600 million investment in its sole American factory.In a statement, the chief executive of the Volkswagen brand, Herbert Diess, said, During his time in the U.S., Michael Horn built up a strong relationship with our national dealer body and showed exemplary leadership during difficult times for the brand.After the fraud, Mr. Horn managed to maintain the strong support of the dealers, even as the company scrambled to do damage control. In a letter to dealers, he stressed the companys commitment to the sales force. The company also guaranteed bonuses to dealers who sold cars in the last half of 2015.Mr. Brown, of the dealer council, said last year that unless Mr. Horn was directly implicated in the fraud, his removal would be nothing short of catastrophic to our market."}
{"text": "JOHN GUTFREUND, WHO RAN SALOMON BROTHERS AT ITS APEX, DIES  |  John H. Gutfreund, who personified the rise and fall of Wall Street moguls in the 1980s, died in Manhattan on Wednesday at age 86,\nJonathan Kandell writes in DealBook. The cause was pneumonia.Mr. Gutfreund, known as the king of Wall Street,  transformed Salomon into one of the worlds largest securities traders when he was chairman and chief executive. Under his leadership, Salomon became the leading dealer in Treasury bonds, the predominant underwriter of corporate securities and pioneered turning ordinary home mortgages into tradeable securities.At work, Mr. Gutfreund was known for his gruff demeanor, foul language and an ever-lit cigar. Michael Lewis described him in Liars Poker as the last person a nerve-racked trader wanted to see.He was also famous for his social life, referred to as Solemn John next to his wife, Social Susie. He and his second wife, Susan, were known for spending lavishly on parties, even buying two seats on a Concorde at one point for a cake and its baker.Eventually, Salomon lost its knack for innovation and the bond market crash of 1987 left it reeling and vulnerable. In 1991, a badly managed episode involving the purchase of Treasury bonds nearly sank Salomon and  Mr. Gutfreund resigned as chairman and chief executive.He agreed to never run a securities firm and to pay a $100,000 fine, but he spent years battling a suit filed by private lawyers on behalf of Salomon shareholders who felt that the scandal had caused the value of their stock to decline. He also spent millions trying to get Salomon to pay him the $15 million he believed he was owed in retirement and option plans.By the late 90s, Mr. Gutfreund seemed reconciled with his fall from grace, putting his legal problems behind him and running an investment consulting firm.What I have learned, or at least belatedly remembered, is that there is the possibility of a satisfying life that is broader than the street, he said.MUTUAL FUNDS RESIST S.E.C.

{"text": "Switzerlands Office of the Attorney General announced on Wednesday that it had enlisted the help of French authorities in its continuing criminal investigation of Sepp Blatter, the former president of FIFA, world soccers ruling body.This week, the French police searched the headquarters of the French soccer association in Paris at the request of Swiss authorities.The search was tied to a payment of roughly $2 million that Mr. Blatter made to Michel Platini, the head of European soccers governing body, in 2011 for work done years earlier. That payment, considered suspicious by authorities, is central to Switzerlands current inquiry into Mr. Blatter; the investigation was announced in September and is exploring the possible misappropriation of FIFA funds.From 1998 to 2002, Mr. Platini was a FIFA employee working from Paris, in offices leased from the French soccer association. On Tuesday, the French police seized documents from those offices, the Swiss authorities said, at which two other full-time FIFA staff members had worked alongside Mr. Platini.Lawyers for Mr. Blatter, who will turn 80 on Thursday and has long denied all accusations of bribery or corruption, declined to comment Wednesday. Because of Switzerlands decision to publicly name him as a subject of a criminal investigation last fall, Mr. Blatter is afforded real-time access to investigators files on him, meaning he will have insight into the documents seized this week.The Swiss announcement came a day after American authorities revealed an advancement in their own case against FIFA, which is based in Switzerland. On Tuesday, a new defendant pleaded guilty in federal court in Brooklyn, while another was extradited from Switzerland to the United States.The Swiss authorities have for the last nine months served a key supporting role in the United States case, arresting defendants, holding them in jail and ruling on requests to extradite them, while also fulfilling requests for bank information and documents. Still, the Swiss authorities have been wary of being outshined by American prosecutors in policing crime within Switzerland.This week, as Switzerlands own FIFA investigation expanded beyond the countrys borders, the Swiss authorities found themselves requesting the same type of international legal assistance they had for months provided to the United States.The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, a statement released on Wednesday said, thanks to the French judicial authorities for their valuable support in this matter."}
{"text": "At an industry conference last week, the lead regulator for the Securities and Exchange Commissions asset management division came under fire.The official, David W. Grim, was highlighting an initiative that would require mutual funds to increase their liquidity cushions to accommodate investors looking to leave in a hurry.But the two industry representatives sitting on his panel  both of whom had held the fund watchdog job before he did  immediately went after him, arguing that the proposal was misguided and overly restrictive.Hold on a minute, said Mr. Grim, a 20-year S.E.C. veteran whose gaunt appearance was accentuated that day by a cold that had left his voice scratchy and weak.If investors want their money back, they should get it back  it is the core tenet of mutual funds, he said.The agency is moving closer to putting the finishing touches on a new set of rules that would require mutual funds to not only set aside a larger share of easy-to-sell securities but also disclose in detail how quickly they can dispose of all that they own. And the fund management industry is pushing back  hard.The commissions effort has taken on a new urgency since investors in Third Avenue Managements failed credit fund were barred in December from taking out their money.It has been close to 20 years since the S.E.C. last addressed the critical issue of how much of a funds assets should be invested in hard-to-sell securities. And during that period, the proportion of funds that invest in high-yielding assets like emerging markets and corporate bonds has increased sharply.According to data from a recent S.E.C. paper, these types of funds accounted for 37 percent of the $12.6 trillion fund sector in 2014, compared with 16 percent in 2000.To a certain degree, this push by the agency to require funds to be more liquid and disclose the riskiness of their investments mirrors the regulatory demands that commercial and investment banks face in terms of higher capital requirements and restrictions on trading activities.And bodies like the International Monetary Fund, the Bank of England and the United States Treasury have been warning about the increasing risks taken by mutual funds as they pursue higher yields in a world of rock-bottom interest rates.As banks become more regulated, there is a risk that the frailties of banking are replicated elsewhere  such as mutual funds with short-term or runnable liabilities investing in opaque credit instruments, said Paul Tucker, chairman of the Systemic Risk Council and the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, who wrote one of the few comment letters endorsing the proposal. When this kind of thing goes wrong the social costs are very high, so we hope very much that the S.E.C. does not retreat on this.Mutual fund companies and their defenders have taken up arms in numerous ways. They are challenging S.E.C. officials in public forums like last weeks industry gathering in New York (sponsored by the Practising Law Institute) and a larger conference next week put on by the Investment Company Institute, the main lobbyist for the industry.They have posted a stream of comment papers on the S.E.C.s website, explaining why these proposals would do more harm than good. And they have pressed their case in person, meeting at least 15 times with agency staff since last fall, according to regulatory filings.The essence of the industrys complaint is that the idea of segregating securities in a portfolio on the basis of how many days it would take to sell them is a fools errand. Liquidity, or finding a buyer for what you want to sell, is one of Wall Streets foggiest and most subjective notions. To guess how many days it would take to sell a leveraged loan or a corporate bond from Brazil is next to impossible, experts argue.We agree that it is time to modernize the regulation of mutual funds, said Barbara G. Novick, a vice chairwoman at the $4.6 trillion fund giant BlackRock who oversees its government relations activities. But there are better ways to do this. In BlackRocks comment letter to the S.E.C., the firm recommended classifying securities by tiers of liquidity as opposed to the exact number of days it would take to sell each one.Mary Jo White, the S.E.C. chairwoman, has said that the issue of fund liquidity is a priority for the commission in 2016. And while the agencys staff is expected to submit a revised proposal to the commission this year, it is unclear how the S.E.C. will respond to the criticisms.Joining the outcry are three of Mr. Grims predecessors at the S.E.C.s investment management division who are now advocates for the industry.One of those advocates, Barry P. Barbash, represents fund companies at the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, and another, Paul F. Roye, wrote the comment letter in opposition to the S.E.C. rules for Capital Research and Management, a large asset manager based in Los Angeles.Mr. Barbash and Mr. Roye were the ones who criticized Mr. Grims proposals on the conference panel last week. Norm Champ, Mr. Grims immediate predecessor, attended as a newly minted partner focusing on regulatory matters in the fund industry for the law firm Kirkland & Ellis.Mr. Grim, 46, is by comparison an anomaly. He has worked in the commissions investment management division for his entire career, forgoing lucrative pit stops in the private sector.Mr. Grim is a furious advocate of the investors right to cash out of a mutual fund. He recites a simple maxim when explaining why fund companies need a tighter leash: It is the investors money, and if they want it back, they should be able to get it back.The Third Avenue debacle had a particular resonance for him. Just three months after he outlined his proposal that funds revamp their cash management practices, a fund slammed the door on its investors because it had misjudged its ability to unload hard-to-sell investments.We have to do better, Mr. Grim said at the conference, making the case that mutual funds promising instant liquidity must not get bogged down with impossible-to-sell securities. That is the big lesson for me in terms of what happened at Third Avenue."}
{"text": "RIO DE JANEIRO   Prosecutors filed charges on Wednesday against former President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, one of Brazils most prominent political figures, shaking the countrys already anxious political establishment.The charges, brought by prosecutors in So Paulo State, are connected to claims of money laundering and misrepresentation of assets involving a luxury apartment in the beachfront city of Guaruj. It is unclear what the specific charges are.Federal investigators say that Mr. da Silva effectively acquired the property, a claim he denies, and that O.A.S., a construction company, paid for improvements at the apartment with funds that may have come from the giant graft scheme at Petrobras, the national oil company.The charges came after Mr. da Silva, 70, was held for questioning and his home raided by the police last week.While a judge still needs to decide whether to accept the charges and put Mr. da Silva on trial, the positioning of the former president at the center of the Petrobras scandal is focusing scrutiny on him  and his handpicked successor, President Dilma Rousseff. Mr. da Silva, who was president from 2003 to 2010, still wields unrivaled sway in the governing leftist Workers Party. Mr. da Silvas supporters have condemned the legal maneuvering against him, contending it is part of a media conspiracy to oust Ms. Rousseff and prevent Mr. da Silva from running again in 2018.In a statement, Mr. da Silvas lawyer questioned whether the lead prosecutor in the case, Cssio Conserino, harbored political motivations.The lawyer, Cristiano Zanin Martins, also said Mr. da Silva had never concealed paying installments toward buying the apartment but decided against taking control of the property last year."}
{"text": "CASCO, Me.  Kevin Hancock, chief executive of his familys lumber company, thought things could not possibly get worse: The housing market was sputtering, hundreds of lumberyards had shut down and his company had to resort to painful cuts, hiring freezes and layoffs at its sawmills and retail stores.The future of Hancock Lumber, started in 1848, and the livelihoods of hundreds of workers weighed heavily.It was pretty stressful, Mr. Hancock said.Then, he lost his voice.When he tried to talk, his throat would tighten. He sounded and felt as if he were being strangled. What Mr. Hancock initially dismissed as a sore throat was diagnosed as spasmodic dysphonia, an incurable neurological condition that causes spasms in the vocal cords and is made worse by stress.Mr. Hancock worried whether his work would prevent him from regaining consistent use of his normal speaking voice. He wondered whether he could continue as chief executive.He did.That was in 2010. Today he considers the loss of his voice a positive turning point. It prompted a trip to one of the most impoverished corners of the country. And in the five years since, the privately held company has hit record levels of efficiency and productivity, and sales of nearly $140 million in 2015.Mr. Hancock dismissed any suggestion that he is the driver of the companys success. Hancock Lumber, he pointed out, has benefited from the economic recovery, and from initiatives that were years in the making.But losing his voice forced him to redefine his role and share power more broadly. It helped accelerate a culture of individual responsibility, he said. And that has paid off.When I first acquired this, I wondered whether I would be able to do my job, Mr. Hancock, 49, said. Now I can see that it actually makes me better at my job.Mr. Hancock never planned to join the family business. After graduating from Bowdoin College with a degree in American history, he taught and coached basketball at a postgraduate prep school, one that offers a year of education beyond high school.But when his father, David, Hancock Lumbers chief executive, learned he had lymphoma in 1991, Kevin Hancock went to work at one of the companys stores. The elder Mr. Hancock died in 1997, and the next year, Kevin, then 32, became president.Despite his youth, leadership came naturally. Kevin Hancock, the gregarious father of two, became a go-to guy in Maine for keynote speeches and capital campaigns. People often asked about a run for governor. In 2005, he became chairman of the National Lumber and Building Material Dealers Association.Hes just so authentic and has this presidential charisma, said Rita Ferris, president of the Northeastern Retail Lumber Association. There isnt ever a time when youre not really excited by the time youre done meeting with him.Hancock Lumber earned the admiration of peers for its innovations. The company was among the first in the industry to adopt lean manufacturing practices and to manage deliveries to ensure that customers received them On Time and In Full, an industry standard known as OTIF. This is a high hurdle to clear, said Craig Webb, editor in chief of ProSales, a trade magazine based in Washington.You have to get all parts of the company involved, Mr. Webb said. Your salespeople cant make promises that your yard crews cant deliver. Your buyers have to make sure youre in stock. Production has to be efficient. The orders have to get out on time. And the drivers have to meet all those demands.And then the housing market fell apart.Between 2005 and 2011, new housing starts in southern Maine declined 66 percent, and Hancock Lumbers store sales dropped 45 percent. Over about the same period, the size of its work force declined 40 percent through attrition and layoffs.Those who worked alongside Mr. Hancock at the time said that the pains he took to be upbeat and upfront helped shore up morale. Trying to keep a business open when your primary market is gone is amazingly difficult, said Ruth Kellick-Grubbs, a Tryon, N.C., consultant who sits on Hancock Lumbers board. If the company didnt have the right people with the right attitude to maintain service, that wouldnt have happened.Then Mr. Hancock lost his voice.It is not known what causes spasmodic dysphonia, which affects an estimated 50,000 people in the United States, including the radio host Diane Rehm and the environmental activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. For some people, like Mr. Hancock, the initial onset follows a stressful event, said Dr. Andrew Blitzer, director of the New York Center for Voice and Swallowing Disorders.Mr. Hancock got temporary relief from speech therapy, and from injections of Botox into the muscles of his larynx, a standard treatment.When his symptoms were at their worst, efforts to speak left him gasping and sore. It was pretty isolating, he said.He had to reinvent the way he worked. At meetings he once led, he now sat in the second row, jotting down notes. As he spoke less and listened more, he discovered how many managers and front-line employees had ideas for changes and wanted to take responsibility for them. He began delegating more.You see the passion and ideas coming from others, he said. People are smart, and they know what needs to happen and they want to do a good job.By 2012, the company had regained firm financial footing, and Mr. Hancock was ready to take some time off.He had always been interested in the history of the American West in the late 19th century. He had read about the severe housing shortage at Pine Ridge, an Oglala Lakota Sioux reservation in South Dakota. He felt drawn there.At Pine Ridge, Mr. Hancock completely unplugged from his duties as chief executive. And he began to realize how much those duties had come to define him.I learned that being C.E.O. of Hancock Lumber was just a role that I played, he said. I felt that I acquired S.D. because I had become too consumed in my roles and work responsibilities. I needed to bring more balance into my life, which for me meant that the work would be important but not all-consuming.He also became passionate about sharing the stories of the Oglala Sioux people and raising awareness about the economic and social challenges faced by the Pine Ridge residents.Hancock Lumber donated materials to construct a two-bedroom home on Pine Ridge. Mr. Hancock established a nonprofit, the Seventh Power Foundation, to celebrate the identity of the Oglala Sioux and to raise money for projects that strengthen residents economic independence.In 2015, Mr. Hancock wrote and self-published a 500-page memoir about his experiences, Not for Sale: Finding Center in the Land of Crazy Horse.Medical issues in the executive suite do not typically bode well for a companys bottom line. Nor do vision quests  a sort of trip with a purpose that is a rite of passage in some Native American cultures. But at Hancock Lumber, they unfolded in tandem with changes that led the company to record-setting performance.In 2012, the company completed the rollout of a bonus program that rewarded workers for increasing accuracy on customer orders, productivity and profitability. Along with raises in base pay, that has pushed up compensation by more than 3 percent a year on average for the last three years.Improvements in efficiency also paved the way for a shorter workweek for many of the companys 458 employees. Since the incentives were begun, the average workweek for hourly employees dropped to 41 hours from 47.Mr. Hancock conceded that the initiatives are not cure-alls but steps toward restoring the work-life balance that he envisioned during his time at Pine Ridge.If people can work just a little bit less and earn just a little bit more, thats the right direction to be trying to move, he said.The changes have helped sales grow by an average of 8 percent annually over the past three years.Everything theyve been working on for years is hitting on all cylinders, said Ms. Kellick-Grubbs. And theyre not letting off the gas."}
{"text": "JAKARTA, Indonesia  Millions of Indonesians witnessed a rare total solar eclipse early on Wednesday that turned morning into night in some areas and inspired special prayer vigils, cultural dances, live music and observation parties.It was the first total solar eclipse, in which the moon obscures the sun by passing directly between it and Earth, since March 20, 2015. That event was visible only in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Svalbard archipelago of Norway.The eclipse on Wednesday, which began at 6:19 a.m. in Jakarta, the capital, was visible in nearly half of Indonesias 34 provinces. Partial eclipses could be seen in the region, including in Australia and Singapore; in some Pacific island nations and in Hawaii.Because of the eclipses trajectory, the regions of South Sumatra, Indonesian Borneo, Central Sulawesi and Eastern Indonesia got the best shows, with the small town of Ternate in the Maluku Islands deemed the prime viewing location. International scientists were in the Malukus to observe the eclipse, while tens of thousands of Indonesians and foreign tourists flocked to various regions for the event.Indonesian television stations broadcast live shots of the eclipse in different stages from four regions across the 3,100-mile archipelago, showing a pitch-black moon with a bright halo.In Palembang, the capital of the province of South Sumatra, the morning sky turned to dusk at the peak of the eclipse, and streetlights were turned on to assist motorists and pedestrians.It was darker than I expected, said Jules Brookfield, a Jakarta-based American hotel executive who flew to Palembang for work and to watch the eclipse, which he did from a hotel rooftop. There was lots of cheering, and it suddenly got cooler out.He said hotels across the city were booked.I had no idea it was such an event, he said.Thousands of mosques across the country held special eclipse prayers. Indonesia is the most populous Muslim-majority nation in the world.Although Jakarta was not a prime viewing location, clear morning skies there allowed residents to see the eclipse if they donned tinted glasses or improvised using medical X-rays or exposed camera film to block out the sunlight. In residential neighborhoods near the city center, mosque loudspeakers blared prayers and songs as the eclipse reached its peak around 7:20 a.m.The sun was totally obscured in some areas of Indonesia for nearly three minutes, but the morning skies were back to normal within two hours of the eclipses start."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re A Shield for Monsanto (Business Day, March 1): Monsanto as well as The Timess own contacts in the Senate and House all confirmed that the company had nothing to do with proposing the legislation in question. Still, your article only serves to promote the legal cases of attorneys suing Monsanto, and imply an involvement by Monsanto that is not true.The legislation being proposed in Congress would replace the Toxic Substances Control Act, which for four decades has provided a framework within which to operate when it comes to polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. The proposed legislation in the House does not change the law as it has been for decades in regard to PCBs.Safety is our No. 1 priority, and we want to make sure that we know and abide by all requirements and restrictions in this area. We are hopeful that chemical manufacturers and consumers alike will be able to continue to rely upon the Toxic Substances Control Acts regulatory structure.PHILIP MILLERSt. LouisThe writer is vice president of global government affairs for Monsanto.To the Editor:You reported a scheme by Congressional Republicans to include in legislation to amend the Toxic Substances Control Act a provision that could immunize Monsanto from damages caused by polychlorinated biphenyls, or PCBs. Monsanto was the exclusive American manufacturer of PCBs, which are potent endocrine disrupters and carcinogens.Thousands of American schools built between 1950 and 1979 contain hazardous concentrations of PCBs in their window caulking and lighting fixtures, endangering millions of children. Internal company documents show that Monsanto aggressively marketed this product to schools knowing that it was extremely toxic and would ultimately be prohibited by law. The mitigation costs could run from approximately $1 million to $3 million per building. Congress now seeks to shift these costs to school districts and to abolish Monsantos liability for more than 80,000 miles of PCB-contaminated streams and rivers.Congress should be fighting for the health and environmental interest of Americans and their children instead of safeguarding the ill-gotten profits of one multinational corporation.ROBERT F.

{"text": "The actress Priyanka Chopra, 33, made a career in Bollywood before becoming the first South Asian woman to lead an American network series  that is, the ABC drama Quantico. Though she is currently filming in Montreal for the show, which has been renewed for a second season, she is more often based on a plane, she said. Ms. Chopra was born in Jamshedpur, India, but was also raised in Newton, Mass., and Queens. Her beauty regimen is a hybrid of Indian D.I.Y. and Western favorites.What is most important for your skin care is what you do the night before. You have to remove all remnants of makeup before you go to bed no matter how tired you are. I double wash because I wear a lot of makeup when I work. Right now, Im using Chanel Intense Brightening Foam Cleanser, followed by MAC Green Gel Cleanser. I have dry skin, but its still very important to take off all the makeup and grime. I also double moisturize. I use the Kiehls serum called Daily Reviving Concentrate and then a cream by Tatcha. Ive also found that StriVectin under-eye cream really works for me. Im also trying some lip balms by StriVectin.For my body, I moisturize with Bio-Oil and a body lotion from Diptyque. If Im going in the sun, I wear a face sunscreen by Shiseido. I find most of my products from reading magazines and listening to what makeup artists tell me to do. And I usually do all my shopping at the duty-free, so I keep trying new things. Whenever Im tired or getting on a flight, Ill wear the SK-II mask. Im usually in a cabin on the plane, and I just shut the door and put it on. Sometimes Ill put on fresh yogurt as a mask with a little turmeric powder in it  this is like an Indian trick. The turmeric is a healer for your skin.I try to wear very little makeup on a day-to-day basis. I use Armani foundation under my eyes if I need to. Then its mostly just lip balm or a lip stain. I like the lip stains by Laura Mercier. I also like MAC and Nars lipsticks when Im doing something bold. If MAC, I have Lady Danger, Candy Yum Yum, Ruby Woo, Russian Red and Studded Kiss. Nars, I like the Dolce Vita. I stick with the matte lipsticks. I dont wear gloss. I have really big lips, and when I wear gloss, they look way bigger. I have to keep them in check!My mom wears kohl all the time. Its an amazing look and part of our culture for eons. Kohl makes big brown or black eyes stand out that much more. But Im not big on the smoky eye. I like to keep the eye fresh. I just use YSL mascara and then an Anastasia Beverly Hills pencil for my brows. I actually use my fingers to curl up my mascara. Im not very meticulous when it comes to my makeup. I pretty much use my fingers, except Ill use a brush for my blush. Right now, Im using a Chanel powder blush in Rose Ecrin. The color comes off very natural. Otherwise, Im in the makeup chair almost every day.Its an interesting thing, the concept of beauty as an actor. People have doubted my abilities because of my beauty, and Ive enjoyed proving to them that beauty shouldnt have anything to do with your ability to tell the story. Its important for actors to be chameleons. Beauty is just one aspect.Its very important to me. It makes me feel like Im walking around in my own bubble. Right now Im using Dolce & Gabbana the One and Diptyque LOmbre dans lEau. Im a big fan of Diptyque, which I discovered at duty-free. From traveling so much, my information comes from there!Im very blessed with Indian genes. I have good hair. When I was young, my grandmother used to give me coconut-oil head massages. I used to say, I dont want it! Now of course I know how great it was. I like Oribe products. I love the smell, and I find they make my hair glossy. I use the shampoo, conditioner and maybe a serum. Because Im sitting in the hair and makeup chair all the time, my hair gets blown out, but its actually wavy. I let it be and pull it back if its my day off. For haircuts, I get trims. I cant change it much because Im always filming some scene for a character, and you need continuity. Im telling a story.I try to get massages whenever I can, but Im not very fussy. I go to a nice spa in the city Im in, or I go for a massage at home  somebody that does house calls.Youre going to be very bored with this answer, but I dont do anything for fitness. I realize its my genes and my age. Im going to take advantage of it as long as I can! I drink a lot of coconut water. It has electrolytes, which are good for you. And in Mumbai, the coconuts are so fresh."}
{"text": "MOSCOW   Nadya V. Savchenko, a captured Ukrainian military pilot who, in a show of defiance, raised her middle finger to a Russian judge and sang the Ukrainian national anthem in court, ended a dry hunger strike on Thursday by drinking water, according to her lawyer.But she may have done so after falling for a trick by Russian intelligence officers, her lawyer, Mark Feygin, said.The Ukrainian news media reported that Ms. Savchenko had agreed to drink water after receiving a letter from President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine. Mr. Feygin said he received the letter from a person he understood to be a Ukrainian consular official. Mr. Poroshenkos office, however, issued a statement saying the president had sent no such letter but had asked only that Ms. Savchenkos sister convey his concern and support.Mr. Feygin now regards the letter as a forgery. It was all subterfuge, he said, in comments reported by the newspaper Ukrainska Pravda, and it didnt take place without the participation of special services of the Russian Federation.Ms. Savchenkos refusal to drink water had gone on for five days, through the closing arguments in her trial and her defiant final statement to the court, and she had vowed to carry on. Ms. Savchenko, a 34-year-old veteran of a Ukrainian deployment to Iraq before her more recent duties in Ukraine, was detained under unclear circumstances and is on trial in Russia for the murder of two journalists.The Russian authorities accuse her of acting as an artillery spotter and directing mortar fire at a rebel checkpoint where the television reporters were filming. Ms. Savchenko denies this. Her backers say she was captured before the mortar strike and illegally bundled across the border to Russia to stand trial. Since then, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, among others, have called for her release.In Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, she has become a cause clbre, and about 2,000 people rallied in her support on Sunday. For her final statement on Wednesday, she stood on the defendants bench, made the lewd gesture, sang the national anthem and called the process the farce of Kremlin puppets.In her comments, Ms. Savchenko dared the judge to impose the 23-year sentence prosecutors have requested. If you want to show your strength, go ahead, she said. But remember, we are playing with my life. The stakes are high, and I have nothing to lose.Mr. Feygin said that while she has broken the dry hunger strike, she would continue to refuse food, the Ukrainian news media reported."}
{"text": "The Democrats saved their most raucous debate for what could be their last. For two hours, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont traded sharp attacks in Florida, a crucial battleground state that votes next week, over immigration policy, the government bailout of the automobile industry and, inevitably, the Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump.Immigration policy has been among the biggest substantive differences between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton, and the two attacked each other on the issue while also struggling to explain their past positions. Mrs. Clinton criticized Mr. Sanders for opposing the 2007 immigration overhaul, and she pointed to his inconsistent explanations for doing so.After being prodded by a moderator, Mrs. Clinton appeared to promise to end the White House policy of deporting undocumented immigrant children, a change from her position in 2014, when she said those children should be sent back to their countries and reunited with their families. Mr. Sanders also brought up how Mrs. Clinton waffled on drivers licenses for illegal immigrants at a debate in 2007.But what was most striking was the Democrats contrast on the issue with the leading Republican candidates, including Mr. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who have endorsed mass deportations, which will most likely be a focal point of the general election campaign.Though the debate took place in Miami, both candidates devoted much of their time to the Midwest and the working-class voters who make up large sections of two of the states that will vote on Tuesday: Illinois and Ohio. Free trade is not popular with many voters in that industrial region, and Mr. Sanderss populist message is resonating there, demonstrated most forcefully by his upset win over Mrs. Clinton in Michigan on Tuesday. If his claim that the immigration legislation would drive wages down hurts him with Hispanic voters in Florida, it could help him with workers in the Midwest.Mrs. Clinton repeatedly attacked Mr. Sanders  as she did in Sundays debate in Flint, Mich.  by claiming he had voted against the auto bailout that was seen as saving the industry after the financial crisis of 2008. That attack has been described as partly true at best: Mrs. Clinton picked out a specific vote that Mr. Sanders cast because much of the money in question would go to help Wall Street. But the issue has resonance in places like Michigan and Ohio, and Mrs. Clinton, unbowed, indicated she would continue to use it against him going forward.Both candidates came prepared for a slash-and-burn debate, fully briefed on their rivals records with attack lines at the ready. Mrs. Clinton came at Mr. Sanders with kitchen-sink-style charges from the left but only occasionally mentioned one of her core criticisms: that he makes pie-in-the-sky promises without any way to get them done.Mr. Sanders, looking to capitalize on his win in Michigan, was ready to fight, denouncing her criticisms of his votes related to the auto bailout, insisting she was misrepresenting his record. He attacked her repeatedly over her speeches to Wall Street firms for large sums of money, even suggesting that she might be hiding something by not releasing the transcripts. Mr. Sanders is effective at wielding the political blade, which he reinforced by tartly saying, Madame Secretary, I will match my record against yours any day of the week.For most of her life in the public eye, Mrs. Clinton has been criticized as too stiff or too closed off, too dull or too reserved, too inauthentic or too canned as a politician. She began road-testing a line a few weeks ago about her deficiencies as a politician. When she delivered it in the debate, saying that people know she is not a natural at this like her husband or like President Obama, it came across as authentic and rang true.It was also something of a breakthrough for a candidate who has, over time, been loath to admit to making a mistake, and who does not like letting down her guard. With voters still, after decades, trying to get to know her, it could be a turning point.The toughest lines of the night were not all from the candidates: Many came from the moderators. One after the other came questions, most of them aimed at Mrs. Clinton, that cut to the bone. A few were downright uncomfortable.Mrs. Clinton was asked about how she responds to continuing questions from voters about her trustworthiness. She was asked about the 2012 attacks on the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, which left four Americans dead while she was the secretary of state, prompting boos from the crowd. She was asked about the investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state, and whether she would drop out if she was indicted.That last question left her exasperated, and she said she would not dignify it with an answer. But the questions were a glimpse at the lines of attack she will face in the fall if she is the Democratic nominee.This is not to say that Mrs. Clinton does not want to criticize Mr. Trump on policy: She is all for that. She made mocking reference to the big, beautiful wall that Mr. Trump has pledged to build along the United States border with Mexico and called his comments about Muslims and other groups un-American.But Mr. Trump savaged Mrs. Clinton and her husband late last year when she used the Republican front-runner as a foil in her stump speeches. Both Clintons dropped their references to Mr. Trump shortly after that. When pressed at the debate about Mr. Trumps character and whether he is a racist, Mrs. Clinton replied: Im not going to engage in the kind of language that he uses. I think we can make the case against him if he is the nominee, by pointing out what he has said.What to make of Mrs. Clintons failure to swing at a pitch right over the plate? She seemed to be signaling to Mr. Trump that she was not going to denounce him in personal terms  and to be hoping that he would respond in kind."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Donald J. Trumps blistering critique of American trade policy boils down to a simple equation: Foreigners are killing us on trade because Americans spend much more on imports than the rest of the world spends on American exports. Chinas unbalanced trade with the United States, he said Tuesday night, is the greatest theft in the history of the world.Add a few whereins and whences and that sentiment would conform nicely to the worldview of the first Queen Elizabeth of 16th-century England, to the 17th-century court of Louis XIV, or to Prussias Iron Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, in the 19th century. The great powers of bygone centuries subscribed to the economic theory of mercantilism, Wherein we must ever observe this rule: to sell more to strangers yearly than we consume of theirs in value, as its apostle, the East India Company director Thomas Mun, wrote in the 1600s.Now Mr. Trump is bringing mercantilism back. The New York billionaire is challenging the last 200 years of economic orthodoxy that trade among nations is good, and that more is better.He is well on his way to becoming the first Republican nominee in nearly a century who has called for higher tariffs, or import taxes, as a broad defense against low-cost imports. And there is a good chance he would face a Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, who has expressed fewer reservations about trade, inverting a longstanding political dynamic.Among Republican standard-bearers, Theres nobody since Hoover who talked this way about trade, said I. M. Destler, a public policy professor at the University of Maryland and the author of American Trade Politics, a history. For most of the last century, Mr. Destler said, such skepticism about trade had been relegated to the fringes of the Republican Party.Mr. Trumps mercantilism is among his oldest and steadiest public positions. Since at least the 1980s, he has described trade as a zero-sum game in which countries lose by paying for imports. The trade deficit with China, which reached $366 billion last year, makes America the biggest loser. Our trade deficit with China is like having a business that continues to lose money every single year, Mr. Trump told The Daily News in August. Who would do business like that?During the current campaign, he has regularly advocated tariffs as the best solution.He has promised to penalize American companies that build foreign factories. For months, his favored example was Ford, which announced plans last summer to expand in Mexico. More recently, he has called out Carrier, which is shifting air-conditioner production to Mexico from Indiana.I will call the head of Carrier and I will say, I hope you enjoy your new building,  Mr. Trump said last month. I hope you enjoy Mexico. Heres the story, folks: Every single air-conditioning unit that you build and send across our border  youre going to pay a 35 percent tax on that unit. In January, Mr. Trump proposed a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports during a meeting with the New York Times editorial board. I would tax China on products coming in, he said. I would do a tariff, yes.Economists have long struggled against the popular view that exports are a measure of economic vitality while imports are evidence of regrettable dependence.They argue that the opposite is true.Economists have spoken with almost one voice for some 200 years, the economist Milton Friedman said in a 1978 speech. The gain from foreign trade is what we import. What we export is the cost of getting those imports. And the proper objective for a nation, as Adam Smith put it, is to arrange things so we get as large a volume of imports as possible for as small a volume of exports as possible.But critiques like Mr. Trumps resonate in part because economists have oversold their case. Trade has a downside, and while the benefits of trade are broadly distributed, the costs are often concentrated.Everyone can buy a cheaper air-conditioner when Carrier debarks for a lower-cost country, but a few hundred people will lose their livelihoods.Pietra Rivoli, a finance professor at Georgetown University who explored the effect of increased globalization in her 2005 book, The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy, said Mr. Trump might be finding a receptive audience in part because the United States had provided relatively little help to workers harmed by trade.You have much more negative sentiment about trade in the U.S. than you do in pretty much any other wealthy country, and theyve lost their T-shirt jobs, too, Ms. Rivoli said. Whats going on there is that in those countries, which are even more exposed to trade than we are, those countries have a bigger safety net.Mr. Trump has also accused other nations, notably Japan and China, of cheating by suppressing the value of their currencies to make their exports cheaper.I am all for free trade, but its got to be fair, Mr. Trump has said repeatedly.Economists persuaded governments to abandon mercantilism by demonstrating that trade barriers imposed higher prices on the masses while narrowly benefiting those sheltered from competition.The United States largely dismantled its broad tariffs in the mid-20th century, opening the modern era of globalization. But some tariffs remain, providing a reminder of the costs and benefits. Annual imports of Chinese tires increased to 46 million in 2008 from 15 million in 2004, and American tire makers shed several thousand jobs.So in 2009, the Obama administration, at the urging of workers unions, imposed a Trump-like tariff beginning at 35 percent and expiring after three years.Over a thousand Americans are working today because we stopped a surge in Chinese tires, President Obama said in his 2012 State of the Union address.The measure, however, also increased the amount that Americans spent on tires by about $1.1 billion, according to calculations by Gary Clyde Hufbauer of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. That money, had it been spent on other things, would have supported jobs in other parts of the economy.China, moreover, retaliated by slapping a punitive tariff on American chicken parts  China is a particularly lucrative market for chicken feet  which cost American poultry exporters about $1 billion in lost sales over the same period.Eswar Prasad, a Cornell University economist, said Mr. Trump was raising legitimate concerns. Other nations do impose disproportionate restrictions on American goods, he said. The problem, Mr. Prasad said, is the proposed solution.It might be that the threat of tariffs or other trade sanctions could cause American trading partners to open up their markets or drop their barriers to trade, Mr. Prasad said. Perhaps as a bargaining chip, its not necessarily so bad. But there is a risk that rather than having that positive effect, it leads to retaliation on both sides."}
{"text": "When he was in the middle of his Syrian peace deal negotiations, Secretary of State John Kerry would go to President Obama with a request: Could the U.S. quietly send a few cruise missiles to hit Assad regime targets, just to send a message and maybe move the Syrian president toward a deal.Kerrys looking like a chump with the Russians, because he has no leverage, a senior administration official told Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic.Obama continually said no, and eventually grew impatient. Goldberg asked Kerry if he thought he has more of a bias toward action than Obama. I do probably, Kerry responded. Id say that I think weve had a very symbiotic, synergistic, whatever you call it, relationship which works very effectively. Because Ill come in with a bias toward Lets try to do this, lets try to do that, lets get this done.The new Goldberg essay is a profound and comprehensive look at President Obamas foreign policy thinking, and especially his steadfast desire to reduce American involvement in the Middle East.But its also fascinating to read in the midst of a presidential campaign. It shows how insanely far removed campaign bloviation is from the reality of actually governing. It also reveals that the performance of presidents, especially on foreign policy, is shaped by how leaders attach to problems. Some leaders are like dogs: They want to bound right in and make things happen. Some are more like cats: They want to detach and maybe look for a pressure point here or there.If we want to understand the dog or catlike qualities in candidates, we should be asking them a different set of questions:How much do you think a president can change the flow of world events?President Obama, for example, has a limited or, if you want to put it that way, realistic view of the extent of American influence. He subscribes to a series of propositions that frequently push him toward nonintervention: The world is a tough, complicated, messy, mean place and full of hardship and tragedy, he told Goldberg. You cant fix everything. Sometimes you can only shine a spotlight.Furthermore, Obama argues, because of our history, American military efforts are looked at with suspicion. Allies are unreliable. Ukraine is always going to be in Russias sphere of influence, so its efforts there will always trump ours. The Middle East is a morass and no longer that important to U.S. interests.Even the Iran nuclear deal is seen as a limited endeavor  not to reshape the Middle East but simply to make a dangerous country less dangerous.Do you think out loud in tandem with a community, or do you process internally?Throughout the Goldberg article, Obama is seen thinking deeply and subtly, but apart from the group around him. In catlike fashion, he is a man who knows his own mind and trusts his own judgment. His decision not to bomb Syria after it crossed the chemical weapons red line was made almost entirely alone. His senior advisers were shocked when he announced it. The secretaries of state and defense were not in the room.More generally, Obama expresses disdain with the foreign policy community. He is critical of most of his fellow world leaders  impatient with most European ones, fed up with most Middle Eastern ones.When seeking a description of a situation, does your mind leap for the clarifying single truth or do you step back to see the complex web of factors?Ronald Reagan typified the single clarifying truth habit of mind, both when he was describing an enemy (Evil Empire) and when he was calling for change (tear down this wall). In his interviews with Goldberg, Obama leans to the other side of the spectrum. He is continually stepping back, starting with analyses of human nature, how people behave when social order breaks down, the roots and nature of tribalism.Do you see international affairs as a passionate struggle or a conversation and negotiation?Obama shows a continual distrust of passion. He doesnt see much value in macho bluffing or chest-thumping, or in lofty Churchillian rhetoric, or in bombings done in the name of credibility. He may be critical, but he is not a hater. He doesnt even let anger interfere with his appraisal of Vladimir Putin, praising him for being courteous and businesslike. Because fear distorts judgment, he seeks to place the threat of terrorism in its proper perspective: More Americans die from falling in bathtubs.Personally, I dont think there is one correct answer to whether we want a dog or a cat as leader. Depends on the situation; there are successful examples of both types. But Im struck by how catlike Obama is. And its striking how many Americans have responded by going for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, who are bad versions of the bounding in/we-can-change-everything doggy type."}
{"text": "Join us for live updates of the Republican debate._______The Democratic presidential candidates may agree broadly on immigration, but in their debate Wednesday night, Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont showed their divisions on an array of policy points, while agreeing that they would bring a halt to most deportations. Here is a look at their positions.The moderator, Jorge Ramos of Univision, demanded that Mrs. Clinton promise she would not deport children or other undocumented immigrants who were not criminals.Mrs. Clinton did not go quite as far as Mr. Ramos wanted, making a distinction between families who have been fleeing from Central America and undocumented immigrants already living in the country. For Central American asylum-seekers, she said, we have laws. She said she would try to change the law to guarantee that children would have lawyers in immigration court. (Currently, even a toddler can face an immigration judge without a lawyer.) And she said, A lot of children will, of course, have very legitimate stories under our law to be able to stay.But she stopped short of saying she would not deport migrant children who do not gain asylum.For undocumented immigrants already here, she gave Mr. Ramos her promise. I would not deport children, Mrs. Clinton said. I do not want to deport family members either. Mrs. Clinton said she would deport only violent criminals, terrorists and others who are safety risks.Mr. Sanders had no qualifiers. I will not deport children from the United States of America, he said, extending the pledge to all immigrants with no criminal records.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders said they were in favor of unifying families, but neither said how they would bring back someone who had been expelled.Mrs. Clinton attacked Mr. Sanders for two votes he took in 2006, when, as a congressman, he supported an amendment to block federal officials from telling foreign governments about activities of private border militias like the Minutemen. The amendment, which allowed him to show Vermont voters he was not soft on security at the border with Canada, was a small part of a big homeland security spending bill and did not become law.During that campaign, he also voted for a House bill allowing indefinite detention of undocumented immigrants. That vote could be more problematic for Mr. Sanders. But more than 100 Democrats voted for the bill, which included anti-gang measures. It died in the Senate.Mrs. Clinton again went after Mr. Sanders for his 2007 vote against a Senate bill giving legal status to undocumented immigrants, saying it was our best chance. In front of a largely Latino audience, Mr. Sanders defended his decision, recalling that Lulac  the League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the countrys oldest Latino groups  also opposed the bill.Brent Wilkes, the executive director of Lulac, confirmed on Thursday that the organization opposed the bill, but only in its final form, after Republican amendments had altered many of the provisions written by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat who was one of the bills authors. Latino organizations and labor unions were torn about the bill.Lulac objected to provisions that would have limited guest workers rights and forced them to go home after two years, Mr. Wilkes said. But as Mrs. Clinton noted, the National Council of La Raza and the United Farm Workers supported it in the Senate but hoped for a more favorable version in the House.The choice for both senators in 2007 was harder than Mrs. Clinton has portrayed. But she wins the argument that voting against the bill was, in retrospect, a major miscalculation for supporters of reform. The politics have become more adverse for any comprehensive bill.The contorted efforts by both candidates to defend their records on immigration show how troublesome the issue has been for Democrats. As recently as 2014, Democrats in close Senate and House races ran away from immigration reform, prevailing on President Obama to delay until after the November elections his executive actions to shield undocumented immigrants from deportation. Now, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have embraced a pathway to citizenship and said they would act to go beyond Mr. Obamas actions, ending most deportations.The Democrats see a potentially huge boon from the issue among Latino, Asian and young voters in November, especially when Donald J. Trump, the Republican front-runner, is talking about deporting all 11 million immigrants here illegally."}
{"text": "A group of 17-year-olds in Ohio has successfully persuaded a state judge to allow them to vote in the states primary on Tuesday.The ruling, in state court, came before another suit by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont could be decided in federal court. Mr. Sanders sued Ohios top elections official, Secretary of State Jon A. Husted, in federal court on Tuesday arguing that Mr. Husted had arbitrarily discriminated against young black and Latino voters by not allowing 17-year-olds who will be 18 by the general election in November to vote in the primary on Tuesday.On Friday, an Ohio state judge ruled that the teenagers can vote in the primary as well as in congressional, legislative and mayoral races. Mr. Husted has vowed to appeal the decision.Brad Deutsch, Mr. Sanderss lawyer, praised the state courts ruling Friday.This is a huge victory for 17-year olds across Ohio, Mr. Deutsch said in a statement. Their votes for presidential nominees will now count when they vote on either Tuesday or over the weekend in early voting.He also said the judge had admonished the secretary of state for abusing his discretion by prohibiting 17-year-olds from voting for presidential candidates and not only directed the secretary to instruct poll worker to allow 17-year olds to vote but also instructed them to make a reasonable effort to attempt to determine and record choices that have already been made by any 17-year-old who already voted in early voting.In a statement Friday saying he would appeal the decision, Mr. Husted said, This last-minute legislating from the bench on election law has to stop.We will appeal this decision because if there is a close election on Tuesday we need clarity from the Supreme Court to make sure that ineligible voters dont determine the outcome of an election, he said.Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said he expected that the state ruling would be appealed this weekend. He added that the federal judge dealing with Mr. Sanderss lawsuit has said that he will rule in federal court by Monday afternoon.At least 20 states allow 17-year-olds to participate in presidential primaries or caucuses if they will be 18 on Election Day in November, according to FairVote, a voting-rights advocacy group.In December, Mr. Husted, a Republican, said that under state election law, 17-year-olds could vote in nominating contests but not elections, and thus a presidential primary was off-limits since voters will be electing delegates to the party conventions.Talking to reporters in Toledo before boarding a plane to Illinois, Mr Sanders said he was delighted by the decision.The idea that in the year 2016, we have Republican secretaries of state trying to suppress the vote, trying to make it difficult for young people to participate in the political process, is an outrage, he said. Our jobs is to get more people involved in the process, not fewer people, and I am glad that decision was won and I am confident that it will be sustained.Also at the Toledo rally, Representative Marcy Kaptur of Ohio announced her endorsement.America could have no stronger Democratic leader for jobs in America, for fair trade and for economic progress for all, not just the privileged few, than Bernie Sanders, Ms. Kaptur said as she introduced him in front of 2,600 supporters.Mr. Sanders, addressing the recent incidents of violence at Donald J. Trump rallies, said he hoped that the nation was not at a point where people are going to be intimidated and roughed up and frightened about going to a political rally.We all have different points of view, thats called democracy, Mr. Sanders said. Rallies and events are part of American democracy, he said, adding, And I hope Mr. Trump speaks out forcefully and tells his supporters that that is not what the American political process is about."}
{"text": "Han Tak Lee, 81, spends much of his time alone in a small room in Queens. It is a ground-floor studio apartment with a kitchenette and a bathroom, right beside train tracks used by the Long Island Rail Road. Commuter trains roar by every so often, though the double-glazing of his windows reduces the noise to a gentle whoosh.His cramped living situation invites a comparison to the way he spent most of the past quarter-century. From 1990 to 2014, Mr. Lee was locked away in a series of prisons in Pennsylvania, serving a life sentence for murdering his daughter in a fire. Two years ago, however, a judge exonerated him and ordered him freed after determining that his conviction was based on theories about arson that had later been discredited. An appellate court upheld the ruling in August.Yet Mr. Lee, a free man now, still seems bound by his imprisonment. The experience weighs on him as he reckons with his past and considers the final stretch of his life. He admits to feeling bitterness.I still think its totally unfair that I had to serve 24 years in prison, he said in an interview. Im innocent.He has been surviving on Social Security payments and, more so, on the largess of people who have sympathized with his plight. A support group that formed while he was in prison raised tens of thousands of dollars to help with his legal fees and, after his release, to help pay for his rent and living expenses. But that fund has nearly dried up, and Mr. Lee recently contacted Ron Kim, a Democratic state assemblyman, seeking assistance in finding subsidized housing.He wants to live with dignity for the rest of his life, Assemblyman Kim said.Though in his ninth decade, Mr. Lee, a Korean immigrant who became a naturalized American citizen, is not confronting the challenges of his current circumstances with anything resembling meekness.He is angry at the justice system for locking him up and taking so many years of his life. He is resentful toward his ex-wife, who divorced him while he was in prison. He is estranged from his surviving daughter and her family, he said. He has accused the leadership of his former church of not sufficiently coming to his defense when he was being investigated, even as the church raised about $80,000 over the years to help pay for his legal representation. And he has alienated some of his most ardent supporters.Chris Chang, the spokesman for the support group, said the prison experience had left Mr. Lee suspicious of everyone and their motives, leaving him prone to sudden changes of heart. This unpredictability has led some of his supporters to keep their distance, friends said.Like a volcano, Mr. Chang said.Mr. Lee is unapologetic. I recognize my personality, but thats because of the many experiences Ive had, he said. I am resolute. I am different.He added: I was fully exonerated. It gave me the confidence to be more vocal.In two interviews with Mr. Lee at his apartment, he seemed mostly cheery and good-natured, patiently answering questions about his life in Korean and rudimentary English and laughing frequently. His mood darkened somewhat only when the conversation turned to the subject of his ex-wife and daughter.I dont want to talk about my family, he said sharply. (A member of the support committee provided a phone number for Mr. Lees daughter, but calls went unanswered.)Kyung Tahk Sohn, who attended high school in Seoul with Mr. Lee and is a co-president of the support committee, said: To be frank with you, Mr. Lee has a very special character. He has a very quick temper. Thats why his words hurt them here and there.In my case, Ive known him a long time, I feel like hes my older brother. Thats why I just help him and whatever he says I try to understand him and read his mind. Thats why Im the only one who can talk to him freely.The fire that killed Mr. Lees daughter occurred in July 1989 at a religious retreat in the Poconos run by the church he attended at the time.Mr. Lee, who ran a clothing store and lived with his then-wife and two daughters in Sunnyside, Queens, had taken his oldest daughter, Ji Yun, to the retreat at the urging of the churchs pastor. Ms. Lee, who was 20 and an art student at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, had severe mental illness. He hoped the trip would help her.Early one morning, a fire broke out in their cabin. The authorities found Mr. Lee sitting stoically outside the burning cabin with two packed bags, The ABA Journal, a publication of the American Bar Association, reported in an article about the case. His behavior, deemed strangely passive by investigators, became part of the prosecutions case against him. Ji Yuns burned body was found inside the cabin.At the trial, prosecutors, citing the testimony of fire experts, argued that the charring patterns and glass fracturing indicated a deliberately set fire, and that the arsonist had started the fire in at least eight spots in the cabin using a mixture of home fuel oil and another accelerant, according to news reports. One expert witness said a chemical analysis of Mr. Lees clothes suggested a link to a plastic glove and a jug said to have been used to pour the fuel.In defending Mr. Lee, his lawyer argued that Ji Yun had set the fire herself. Mr. Lee said he had been asleep when the flames broke out and had unsuccessfully tried to rescue his daughter.The jury sided with prosecutors, and he was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to life in prison.His case became a cause clbre among Koreans in the United States, and his trial was closely followed in South Korea. After his arrest, members of the Korean population in New York formed the support group, called the Free Han Tak Lee Committee, and in the ensuing years raised money to help pay his legal fees.Mr. Lee said he was very isolated in prison, keeping largely to himself and living for years in his own cell. He never encountered another Korean during his time behind bars, he said.In 2014, a magistrate judge in Harrisburg, Pa., found that long-held beliefs about the science of fire, which were at the core of the prosecutions case, had been discredited. A federal judge adopted the magistrate judges recommendation that Mr. Lees conviction and sentence be vacated, and he was released. Prosecutors unsuccessfully appealed the decision.After he left prison, Mr. Lee moved into his current home, just off Northern Boulevard, in Murray Hill, a middle-class neighborhood with a large Korean immigrant population. He said he chose to live there because it was near his sister, a Long Island resident.Four days a week, he goes to a senior center where, he said, he takes exercise and dance classes and eats meals.Sometimes, in the evening, he meets with members of his current church. But otherwise he is mostly by himself in his apartment, which is dominated by a large bed with a saffron-colored bedspread. The room is cluttered with the flotsam and jetsam of a curious man  or a man who for years was deprived of possessions: stacks of printed material neatly piled on tables and a small desk, including books, magazines, fliers and store brochures; a quiver of small American and South Korean flags; an empty Starbucks cup; pill bottles; a paper Burger King crown. A framed naturalization certificate is one of the few adornments on the walls. His television is often on.Pennsylvania does not provide compensation to people wrongly convicted of a crime; Mr. Lee has not filed a lawsuit over his wrongful imprisonment. But his lawyers are looking at whether he has a remedy available, said Peter Goldberger, a lawyer who has represented him for about 15 years.The support committee has been paying his rent  $1,000 per month  and giving him a monthly allowance of $700, Mr. Chang said. But with the money running out, the members are trying to find alternative, cheaper housing for Mr. Lee.Mr. Kim, whose Assembly district includes Murray Hill, said city officials had done a full assessment of Mr. Lees living situation and health and were considering his case. In addition, the assemblyman is working with community groups to figure out ways to help him.Im putting myself in his shoes and trying to understand about how he was able to cope with being locked away for so many years and to be back and finally have his freedom, yet is struggling to live with some sort of integrity, Mr. Kim said. Theres such a feeling of injustice.But Mr. Lee is far from giving up. Mental focus, he declared. Endurance."}
{"text": "Heres how we analyzed the Republican debate._______MIAMI  The four candidates still battling for the Republican nomination for president gathered at the University of Miami for the partys 12th debate, hosted by CNN. Donald J. Trump leads in both delegates and states won, with Gov. John Kasichs home state, Ohio, and Senator Marco Rubios home state, Florida, both heading to the polls on Tuesday. In a surprise twist, the first question, on jobs and the economy, goes to Mr. Kasich. Asked by Jake Tapper, the debate moderator, if his advocacy for trade deals had come at the expense of the middle class, Mr. Kasich cited his blue-collar background  his father was a mailman and his family worked in the steel industry  and said he believes in free trade, but fair trade. Mr. Rubio  who supports increasing the number of H-1B visas for high-skilled workers  was asked about the case of Disney, which used a loophole in the program to lay off American workers and replace them with foreign workers. Companies like Disney that abuse the program, he said, should be barred from using it in the future. On the question of visas for high-skilled workers, Mr. Trump seemed to try to have it both ways. As a businessman, he said, he uses the program and I do what I have to do. But, he added, its unfair for workers  And we should end it. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas used the H-1B question to switch to the issue of illegal immigration, a hot topic for the Republican base. He said he would cut federal funds to sanctuary cities that dont follow the nations immigration laws. And, he added, Democrats dont have the political will to fix the nations broken immigration system, because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters. And the mystery of just why Mr. Trump is holding a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, his private club, on Friday morning became clear midway through the first hour, when Mr. Trump declared that Ben Carson, the retired pediatric neurosurgeon, would be endorsing him. He will make sure Mr. Carson will be very involved in his education policies, he added. First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty, Mr. Trump said. Theres no question about that. In any other debate, those would have been fighting words. But none of the candidates have really had a highly heated exchange yet. As Mr. Trump himself said, just moments later, I cannot believe how civil its been up here. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump did get into a brief back-and-forth over Mr. Trumps threat to impose a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods. Mr. Trump called it a threat that would become a tax only if foreign countries, like China, dont behave. Mr. Cruz countered that its not China who pays the tax, but the working men and women here in the United States.Not so, Mr. Trump argued, explaining that he would start building those factories and those plants here instead of China, thus creating more jobs. And then it was time for a commercial break. Asked about his recent comments that Islam hates us, and if he really meant all Muslims, Mr. Trump doubled down:  I mean a lot of them, I mean a lot of them, he said. Theres tremendous hatred, and I will stick with exactly what I said. He is not willing to be politically correct, he said.Im not interested in being politically correct  Im interested in being correct, Mr. Rubio retorted, saying the nation would need to work with Muslim countries to help defeat radical extremism. Mr. Kasich, similarly, said that the United States would need Muslim and Arab countries to fight the Islamic State. On an issue that has dogged Mr. Trump in recent weeks  his calls for violating international law and targeting the families of suspected terrorists  the New York billionaire called on existing laws to be expanded in order to fight terrorists on equal footing. Both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio, meanwhile, quickly and firmly said they would not target the families of terrorists. Mr. Trump said that he would be a strong supporter of Israel, citing a somewhat unlikely list of credentials: his Jewish son-in-law, his daughter Ivanka who converted to Judaism, and his Jewish grandchildren. He also mentioned that he had served as the grand marshal of the Israeli Day Parade down Fifth Avenue.He also added that a peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians would be a tough negotiation. But, he said, Id like to give it a shot. Asked about his comments seeming to praise authoritarian governments  calling both President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Chinas government during the Tiananmen Square massacre strong  Mr. Trump said that strong doesnt mean good, adding that he was not endorsing the massacre.Putin is a strong leader, absolutely, he said. I dont say that in a good way or a bad way. I say that as a fact. Mr. Kasich, asked a follow-up question, was swift in his rebuke: I think the Chinese government butchered those kids, he said. Does Mr. Trump share some culpability for encouraging the hostile tone at his rallies, which in recent weeks have turned increasing violent, Mr. Tapper asked.I hope not, I truly hope not, Mr. Trump said. But, he said, when his supporters see protesters, when they see whats going on in this country, they have anger thats unbelievable. And, he added, We have some protesters who are bad dudes and are really dangerous. There are only two of us who have a path to winning the nomination  Donald and myself, Mr. Cruz said, responding to a question about the possibility of a brokered convention, and noting that he has finished ahead of Mr. Trump in eight states. He then appealed to voters, saying that if Mr. Trump is the nominee, Hillary Clinton will win in November and urging, Come and join us.But Mr. Trump also returned to the numbers. What Mr. Cruz doesnt mention, he said, is that he has actually beaten Mr. Cruz far more frequently  in 13 states."}
{"text": "When the residents of Villamartn heard that the landmark castle near their small town in southern Spain was to be restored, they probably envisaged a thoughtful restoration of the medieval stronghold to something approximating its former glory.Instead, they have been left with something that many feel more closely resembles a multilevel parking garage.The repair of Matrera Castle, perched on a ridge in the Andalusia region, has infuriated locals and provoked the ire of some conservators. Images of the castle before and after the restoration have recently fueled outrage and ridicule on social media.Its a barbarity, one town resident was quoted as saying by the Spanish news channel La Sexta. I dont like what theyve done at all, said another. It looks like theyve used builders instead of restorers, a third said, using a mild expletive to assess the quality of the work.Hispania Nostra, a preservationist group that advocates the protection of heritage sites, was similarly unimpressed.The work is truly lamentable and has very badly surprised locals and foreigners, the groups vice president, Carlos Morens, said on its website, calling the project an example of the massacre of Spanish heritage.The architect behind the restoration, Carlos Quevedo Rojas, acknowledged that his results were not to everyones taste. I understand the criticism of local people used to seeing the tower look a certain way, he said by phone, but the principal objective was to prevent the collapse of the structure.Mr. Quevedo Rojas said modern standards for restoring historic buildings discouraged efforts to make them look as they might have when first erected. You have to distinguish and maintain the historical value and architectural integrity, he said. You cant make the structure have the same appearance as the original. You cant falsify the appearance. It has to be clear which parts are new and which are old.According to Mr. Quevedo Rojas, plans to restore the castle, which is privately owned, were drawn up in 2011, but had to be altered when the north wall collapsed in 2013 because of floods in the area. In this case, the first objective is to consolidate the structure so it doesnt suffer further collapses, he said.The project, he said, cost hundreds of thousands of euros  he declined to give a specific price  and did not involve public funds. Town authorities and the culture and environment departments of the Andalusia regional government approved the project, he said.Attempts to repair objects of historical significance have gone awry before in Spain. In 2012, a case of suspected vandalism in a church in the northeastern village of Borja turned out to be among the worst art restoration projects of all time: An 83-year-old woman who was an amateur painter admitted having tried to restore a nearly century-old fresco of Jesus crowned with thorns.That story had a somewhat miraculous ending  the botched restoration was so appalling that the church has become a tourist attraction.While the renovated Matrera Castle seems unlikely to enjoy the same fate, the makeover does have its defenders. Jos Mara Gutirrez Lpez, the director of Villamartns small history museum, said critics were simply ill informed.I think the criticism comes from people without any knowledge of the criteria of modern restoration, he said. They wanted it to be restored to the same condition as it was before, but thats not what happens.Mr. Gutirrez Lpez, who has written a book about the castle and the history of its surroundings but was not involved in the repairs, expressed surprise at the negative attention it has received.When there was the collapse in 2013, we couldnt even get 100 signatures together to restore the building, he said. Now theres been this restoration, theres been an outcry. It makes me very frustrated.It looks fine to me, he added. I dont think its out of place at all."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The Obama administration argued on Thursday that no single corporation  even one as successful as Apple  should be allowed to flout the rule of law by refusing to help the F.B.I. unlock the iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., attackers.The administrations sharp tone in a new court filing drew an angry and emotional rebuke from lawyers for Apple, who accused the government of a cheap shot and were particularly upset about what they said was an unfair and inaccurate suggestion that the company has a special relationship with China to protect its corporate interests there.The tone of the brief reads like an indictment, Bruce Sewell, Apples general counsel, told reporters. In 30 years of practice, I dont think Ive ever seen a legal brief that was more intended to smear the other side with false accusations and innuendo.The unusually intense sparring between the two sides signaled an escalation in tension over a case that had already drawn attention worldwide because of the high legal and corporate stakes. The fight has been brewing since mid-February, when Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California ordered Apple to create and deploy an alternative operating system that would help law enforcement agents break into the iPhone in the San Bernardino case.Apple publicly opposed the order, igniting a standoff with the F.B.I. and the Justice Department. The fight has fueled a debate over privacy and civil liberties versus security, becoming a flash point in the growing tension between technology companies and the government over who can have access to private customer data and under what circumstances.In its filing on Thursday in United States District Court in Los Angeles, the Justice Department said that Apple should be compelled to help the F.B.I. break into the iPhone and that the company should not be allowed to hide behind what prosecutors said were diversionary tactics in the court of public opinion.Apple and its supporters try to alarm the court by invoking bigger debates over privacy and national security, the Justice Department said. Apple desperately wants  desperately needs  this case not to be about one isolated iPhone. The governments filing was a point-by-point rebuttal of a motion that Apple filed two weeks ago opposing the federal court order requiring it to break into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the San Bernardino attackers. Apple had argued that the court order violated the companys First and Fifth Amendment rights, and said the governments request oversteps a law called the All Writs Act.In the filing on Thursday, prosecutors argued that they have sought a modest step in the case and that the courts, the executive branch and Congress  not Apple  share the power to decide how best to balance public safety and privacy.The rule of law does not repose that power in a single corporation, no matter how successful it has been in selling its products, prosecutors wrote.The Justice Department also offered a robust defense of the All Writs Act, which dates to 1789. The statute, used to gather evidence in thousands of cases, is an integral part of our justice system, prosecutors wrote.Apple has tried to characterize that statute as an obscure law dredged up by the government to achieve unprecedented power, the Justice Department said. That premise is false.At the same time, prosecutors played down the significance of a ruling that went against them last week in a separate but similar case in a Brooklyn courtroom. In that case, a magistrate rejected attempts by the Justice Department to force Apple to help unlock an iPhone in a routine drug case, saying that the government was using the All Writs Act so broadly that it might be unconstitutional.The Justice Department noted in a footnote Thursday that it was appealing the Brooklyn ruling and that the order carried no weight as precedent in the California case.In another footnote, the Justice Departments tone also turned more ominous, suggesting that it might seek access to Apples source code and private electronic signatures if the company does not cooperate. That would go beyond what the government has previously requested, which is the companys help in weakening the iPhones defenses rather than any direct access to the technology.In a rebuttal to the governments filing, Mr. Sewell of Apple said in a conference call that a number of the governments charges in its latest brief were unfounded.Mr. Sewell said it was the first time ever that Apple had seen the government assert that it made modifications to specifically block law enforcement officials access to its devices. More disturbingly, he said, federal prosecutors used unidentified sources to raise the specter that Apple has a different relationship with China than with other countries.He said such accusations showed that the Justice Department is so desperate at this point that it has thrown all decorum to the winds.Mr. Sewell likened the Justice Departments comments on China to Apple arguing that the F.B.I. cannot be trusted because there are rumors that the bureau was behind the assassination of John F. Kennedy and citing conspiracytheory.com as its source.Everyone should beware, Mr. Sewell said, because it seems that disagreeing with the Department of Justice means you must be evil and un-American.On the actual merits of the dispute, Apples lawyers reiterated that the governments interpretation of the All Writs Act was simply wrong and that the authority the government seeks is breathtaking, essentially arguing that courts can order any private citizens or companies to do what the authorities want so long as there is jurisdiction.Apple will have another chance to rebut the Justice Departments case before a hearing scheduled for March 22 before Magistrate Judge Pym. No matter how she rules, the closely watched case is almost certain to be appealed to the district court, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and perhaps even the Supreme Court."}
{"text": "Afghanistan has been a combat zone for so long that its become a film genre unto itself, with documentaries like Restrepo, features like Lone Survivor, even comedies like Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. Now a Canadian movie, Hyena Road, adds another perspective.Written and directed by Paul Gross, the film, which takes place before Canadian forces ended their military role in 2011, opens with a sniper team led by Ryan Sanders (Rossif Sutherland) killing a Taliban rebel who is planting an I.E.D. along a highway being built in Kandahar Province by coalition forces  the Hyena Road. Soon, with Taliban fighters in pursuit, the team ducks into a village, where an elder hides them before disappearing himself. Back at base, Pete Mitchell (Mr. Gross), a military intelligence officer, tells Sanders he believes the teams protector is the Ghost, a revered mujahedeen leader in the war against the Soviets (and who seems based on the lion of Panjshir, Ahmed Shah Massoud). Mitchell thinks the Ghost could be a vital ally, and Sanders helps locate him. Before long, all three find themselves in harms way.In tutoring Sanders, Mitchell maintains a running commentary on the shifting alliances, and layers of insurgents, warlords, tribal loyalties and age-old clan feuds that make the nation all but impossible for outsiders to subdue.Refreshingly free of jingoism, that detachment unfortunately winds up working against the movie, which doesnt engage emotionally. (That might explain a misguided subplot about Sanderss romance with a female officer.) Even so, Hyena Road is a skillfully filmed reminder, if one is needed, about why Afghanistan earned its status as the graveyard of empires. DANIEL M.

{"text": "When police officers came upon the body of Neda Mae Carter in a park in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, 25 years ago, her face and neck were battered, her arms splayed and her legs straight, in the pose of a crucifixion.A man named Andre Hatchett would be convicted of second-degree murder, based on the testimony of a man who claimed to have witnessed the killing.On Thursday afternoon, prosecutors in State Supreme Court admitted what Mr. Hatchett had maintained since his arrest: that he had not killed Ms. Carter.Mr. Hatchett was failed by almost every institution he came into contact with during the course of his prosecution, Mark Hale, who leads the Brooklyn district attorneys Conviction Review Unit, told a courtroom crammed with Mr. Hatchetts friends and relatives.A wide smile spread across Mr. Hatchetts face and the audience burst into applause as a judge vacated the conviction and dismissed the indictment, carrying out the joint request from prosecutors and Mr. Hatchetts legal team, which includes lawyers from the Innocence Project.Ive been to hell and back, but it feels good to be free, Mr. Hatchett said, his arms draped over his sisters as they walked through Downtown Brooklyn.Mr. Hatchett is the 19th person exonerated in Brooklyn since the district attorney, Ken Thompson, took office in 2014 and bolstered efforts to review questionable convictions. Mr. Hatchetts case had taken place during the tenure of Mr. Thompsons predecessor, Charles J. Hynes, who had created a review unit but was faulted for not acting promptly in resolving questionable cases and for standing by prosecutors accused of misconduct.Before his arrest, Mr. Hatchett was a new father and an ice delivery man living in an apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant with his mother. Now 49, Mr. Hatchett has spent nearly 25 years behind bars. While in prison, he lost both his parents, as well as a son.Seema Saifee, a staff attorney at the Innocence Project, said a confluence of forces had doomed Mr. Hatchett.This case involved a perfect storm of error  bad defense counsel, an unreliable witness, critical evidence that was never disclosed to the defense, Ms. Saifee said.When the killing occurred, on Feb. 18, 1991, Mr. Hatchett was 24 and hobbling on crutches after being hit with bullets in the throat and leg as a bystander in a shooting the previous year. He had an I.Q. of 63, with the reading and writing ability of a first grader, according to lawyers from the Innocence Project.Mr. Hatchett and Ms. Carter had seen each other earlier on the evening of the murder, in a rooming house where his aunt lived alongside Ms. Carter and her mother. Mr. Hatchett gave Ms. Carter money to buy crack, his lawyers said in an interview. She left around 9:30 p.m. and never returned.Though he cooperated with the police and provided an alibi, Mr. Hatchett was arrested and convicted almost entirely on the testimony of a career criminal named Gerard Williams, who said that he had seen, from 30 to 40 feet away, Mr. Hatchett striking a body on the ground in the park that night.Mr. Williams offered the account after he was arrested in connection with a burglary a little over a week after the killing, and after having initially identified someone else as the killer  information the prosecutors never gave the defense, as was required.The defense itself was so incompetent that a judge declared Mr. Hatchetts first trial a mistrial. But even at the second trial, Mr. Hatchetts lawyer failed to present evidence of his intellectual disability or of the fact that his injuries would almost certainly have prevented him from striking Ms. Carter with the force Mr. Williams had described or lugging her body across the park while leaning on crutches.Its frightening how easy it is to convict an innocent person in this country, Ms. Saifee said. And its overwhelmingly difficult to release an innocent person.Barry C. Scheck, a founder of the Innocence Project, praised Mr. Thompsons office for working tirelessly with Mr. Hatchetts team, which also included a lawyer from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, on their efforts. Without this collaboration, Mr. Hatchett would likely still be in jail, Mr. Scheck said.Lawyers from the Innocence Project said that cases similar to that of Mr. Hatchett could be avoided with the right legal safeguards in place, though many proposed changes have languished in Albany for years.The New York Legislature is considering legislation combating the roles that eyewitness misidentification and false confessions play in wrongful convictions. A 2016 proposal by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would mandate, among other regulations, that the police record interrogations of suspects in most violent-crime cases.I just know Im not the only one, Mr. Hatchett said. Theres still a lot of innocent people in jail.Still, the moment demanded celebration. As Mr. Hatchett walked with his family to a Dallas BBQ restaurant for a steak dinner, he began planning a move with his sister Christal Hatchett-Simmons to a house in Pennsylvania.I can already see it, he said. My future."}

I always considered myself a social justice-oriented person, and these exclusionary policies always rubbed me the wrong way  and angered a lot of people. However, the article brings up the excellent point  people in churches and employees in restaurants, fast food, libraries, etc. arent trained to deal with ODs or mental illness. I had to separate my social justice side of my brain with my corporate worker side. Shardy718 in SeattleThis article received 701 comments from Times readers.9. I am a transplant recipient going on nine years with my sisters kidney. A few months ago, a biopsy suddenly revealed that I was undergoing acute antibody-mediated rejection. My body was suddenly attacking the kidney (still working as good as new itself).Kidney is doing well again, but this rejection episode further emphasized for me that the clock is always ticking.

{"text": "For several weeks in February and March, the Whitney Museums fifth-floor gallery has been drenched in the slamming of gates, the rattling of keys and the bellowing of prisoners and guards. The artist Andrea Fraser recorded the sounds at Sing Sing, the infamous prison 34 miles up the Hudson River, then fed them into a gallery thats roughly the same size as the prisons A Block.Down the River, her commanding work, alludes to the practice of separating slaves  and prisoners to this day  from their families and sentencing them to backbreaking labor on the Souths cotton plantations. It is a show that prods viewers to consider the institutional and symbolic polarization that increasingly defines American society, Ms. Fraser said.Artists around the country are grappling with Americas incarceration system, as a subject and a social force. Like Ms. Fraser, Cameron Rowlands show at Artists Space engaged a privileged art world with the economic mechanisms behind mass incarceration, focusing on how our society benefits from prisoners labor.Museum curators are increasingly paying attention to artists that visualize the criminal justice debate, and bringing subjects like necessary prison reform into their institutions, said Klaus Biesenbach, director of MoMA PS1 in Queens. Last December, the Rauschenberg Foundation called for fellowship proposals for Creative Interventions to Mass Incarceration, granting chosen artists up to $100,000.More than five million Americans are currently in prison, on parole or on probation. As prisons swelled rapidly between the early 1970s and today, the country has seen another unprecedented, parallel expansion: The museum industry has grown at record speed, and art prices at auctions have exploded. Ms. Fraser recognizes the paradox of staging a show on prison conditions in an 18,200-square-foot gallery, in a museum that cost $420 million to build. I am not sure that on some level it isnt an absolutely monstrous thing to do, she said.Artists have examined the apparatus of criminal justice before, but for most it was just one topic among many. Danny Lyon took photographs in Texas prisons in 1971 but later shifted his focus to a destitute region in China and, more recently, to the Occupy Wall Street movement.Among the artists who have made mass incarceration their lifes pursuit is the African-American couple Keith Calhoun and Chandra McCormick from New Orleans, whose work was exhibited in the 2015 Venice Biennale. Since 1979, the couple have documented life in and around Angola prison in Louisiana, the state with the countrys highest incarceration rate.The prison system survives because of free labor; that lets you know that slavery still exists, he said, adding that Louisiana prisons lease out inmates as cheap laborers to surrounding communities, contributing to the states high unemployment rate. In some towns, the only job is being a guard, he said.Making art is not always enough. Like Mr. Calhoun, who teaches photography to disadvantaged children, Ashley Hunt, a multimedia artist based in Los Angeles, has split his time creating art that examines power structures and working with disenfranchised communities. One of his recent art projects, Degrees of Visibility, was inspired by the controversy over a new jail adjacent to Frank Lloyd Wrights Marin County Civic Center, just north of San Francisco. The jail, which was criticized for defiling Wrights eminent architecture, was eventually built underground. Mr. Hunts new series consists of exterior photo shots of prisons juxtaposed with writings and music that cement each facility within its communitys complex history. The prisoners remain invisible to the eye of the viewer. I always shoot from a public location, he said, the gaze of the commuter who doesnt know what hes looking at.This was once a fringe issue for artists and institutions, but Ms. Fraser credits increased awareness to news coverage of prisons like Rikers Island and legislative moves toward prison reform. Many museums have expanded their educational departments and raised a new generation of politically minded curators.To illustrate the role artists play in the fight, Mr. Hunt insisted that the New Museum give free tickets to people who otherwise couldnt afford to see his performance, which dealt with New Orleanss refusal to evacuate the Orleans Parish Prison during Hurricane Katrina. Mr. Hunt said putting pressure on an institution can have a micro-political effect that ripples through the art world.The curator at the Newspace Center for Photography in Portland, Ore., Yaelle Amir, recently invited Pete Brook, known for his blog prisonphotography.org, to organize the coming group show Prison Obscura. (The exhibition was commissioned by Haverford College in Pennsylvania.)Theres more of an expectation not just to see beautiful work on the walls but also to learn something about society, she said. A gallery allows that space for it. She added, You cant ignore the fact that theres more funding for this kind of work and a lot more support and that more nonprofit and community groups are bonding together with artists.While Ben Davis, the author of 9.5 Theses on Art and Class, praises artists for taking up the topic, he warned: We should push the question beyond just consciousness-raising. There is this progressive-era style of political art where well-to-do people throw banquets for homeless people and then stand up on the balcony and congratulate themselves. There is an icky history of using the suffering of the people at the bottom as a spectacle. Some artists are taking inspiration from their own experiences with the criminal justice system.Deana Lawsons series of intimate, yet alienating photographs  part of MoMA PS1s recent Greater New York show  tracked her cousins prison visits over a period of years through images taken by a prison photographer in the visiting room. While the couples infant grows into a kindergartner, the childs father, always in his correctional-green pants with the same downtrodden expression, seems to be stuck in time.Sable Elyse Smiths interest in prisons is tied to her own father, who is serving a life sentence. Her show at Soho20 Gallerys project space showed aerial photographs of prisons lifted from the website of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Displayed alongside were a scattering of visual and auditory fragments that drew the viewer into the prisoners cruel institutional world: a poem; a hostile blue light; scratchy sounds; and the picture of a Harlem school seen through a chain-link fence.Im interested in violence and trauma and memory, Ms. Smith said, referring to her own childhood but also to Americas larger social landscape.While most of the artists emphasize the positive aspects of bringing attention to mass incarceration, Christine Wang, a young Los Angeles painter who studied under Andrea Fraser at the University of California, Los Angeles, is skeptical. My paintings cant vote, Ms. Wang said matter-of-factly, adding that her work mostly deals with her feelings of guilt over her privilege as an artist. This is why she decided to help organize art auctions for Critical Resistance, a nonprofit that fights the building of more prisons in Louisiana and California.In her most recent work, Ms. Wang adorned cardboard boxes with gold-leaf lettering that read #dineLA and #1stworldproblems. The hashtags refer to the gentrification of downtown Los Angeles. Shops, restaurants and art galleries have moved in, leading law enforcement to ticket homeless people for carrying open containers of alcohol. If they cant pay the fines, they end up in jail.The art world, she said, is complicit in the mechanisms of racism and incarceration."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump announced from the stage at a rally in Kansas City, Mo., that a man who had charged him at an event earlier Saturday was probably linked to the Islamic State, appearing to base his statement on an Internet video that has been described as a hoax.This was a guy that was looking to do harm, Mr. Trump said at his last event of the day. It was probably ISIS or ISIS-related, can you believe it?He added that my people found this on the Internet, and just before the rally he posted it on Twitter. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 12, 2016Earlier Saturday, in Dayton, Ohio, a man jumped a barrier and rushed toward the stage, causing a brief scare as Secret Service agents surrounded Mr. Trump. The man was tackled and taken away.Later, a video surfaced purporting to show the same man at a protest months ago. That video was taken and overlaid with Arabic text and music, but it appears to have been done as a hoax. No government agency has suggested that the man was connected to terrorism.But that did not stop Mr. Trump from insisting that there was a more sinister threat.Certainly hes not in love with our country, that I can tell you, he said.Mr. Trump said that in the future he would press charges against protesters to deter them because their lives are going to be ruined, and theyll know their lives are going to be ruined.Demonstrating his point later, when a woman shouted during the rally, he called out, Arrest her. Arrest her. (It was unclear if she was arrested.)"}
{"text": "SUNDAY PUZZLE Please tell me this has happened to you  I solved this whole puzzle, cogitated, doodled, napped, did yoga and otherwise digested it, and never got the theme.  I dare say I would never have gotten it   I needed professional help  even though it makes perfect sense and is in no way obscure, cheap, overly intellectual or otherwise flawed.   For whatever reason, the commonality in the answers was just squarely in my blind spot, and now I dont understand how I missed it  the title also should have helped.None of the theme clues were easy enough for me to answer without multiple crosses.  Fortunately, there were enough straightforward words to make a dent without getting discouraged.  I knew DR PHIL wrote Life Code and Jake TAPPER from CNN, Ed ASNER as Lou Grant, the Marco POLO, AYN Rand, Bobby ORR enough to start picking up on some more useful answers.I appreciated Take unwanted steps? for TRESPASS, and Ingredient thats been left out? was a nice hint for SUNDRIED TOMATO. Since I was strong on the top, I got POPSICLE STICK and TUPPERWARE PARTY fairly early, and noted the extra Rs, already in circles, no less.

Like one of those monkeys randomly churning out the Bible, hooting and pushing buttons.Tom McCoys comments:Initially, I thought about making this a two-way rebus that was the letters OR in one direction and the registered trademark symbol in the other, with the idea being that solvers would have to figure out to write the R inside the O. It seemed like a bit of a stretch to have solvers figure out the writing-one-letter-inside-the-other part, though, so I changed it to the current version.I dont get these people either, but I encourage their behavior:What did you think?"}
{"text": "This week, Amazon revealed the location of its second brick-and-mortar bookstore, which will open in a few months in Southern California, at a mall near the University of California, San Diego. The online retailer seems to have big ambitions for its physical stores.On Wednesday, Nick Wingfield, who covers Amazon for The New York Times, visited the only Amazon bookstore in existence, in the University Village mall in Seattle. From inside the store, he had an online chat with Alexandra Alter, who writes about publishing for The Times. They discussed Amazons strategy and how the retailers stores differ from other bookstores. Heres what they had to say:ALEXANDRA ALTER: Hi Nick! Youre reporting live from the mother ship! Whats it like?NICK WINGFIELD: The best part is, I just tested the free Wi-Fi and its 114 Mbps, easily the fastest Ive ever gotten. Thank you, Jeff Bezos!ALEXANDRA: Great, so you can just buy stuff from the Amazon website while youre sitting in the store. Unlike Barnes & Noble, I bet Amazon doesnt mind if people browse in its store then go buy it online.NICK: Exactly. Heres the deal: At first glance, it looks like an ordinary but nice Barnes & Noble store. Its clean and well-lit and corporate. It doesnt have the charm of a funky used-bookstore. Once you start poking around the shelves, you notice the differences.ALEXANDRA: How is the selection different? How are the sections organized?NICK: They have 5,000 to 6,000 book titles, fewer than what you would find at a big Barnes & Noble. All of the books are arranged cover out, rather than spine out, in the belief that it makes browsing more friendly. I am so buying that Boho Crochet book.ALEXANDRA: Ha, I see Amazon is going big on adult coloring books  smart move since those have taken over the best-seller list on the website. Can you check something out for me? I heard that the store has a shelf of books recommended by Jeff Bezos. Is his wife MacKenzies novel there?NICK: Ill go look now.O.K., Im back. You were right! He does recommend his wifes book. He discloses his conflict of interest. But still ALEXANDRA: Lucky guess. What else is he recommending?NICK: Kazuo Ishiguros The Remains of the Day and Seveneves by the science-fiction writer Neal Stephenson, who incidentally used to work for Bezoss space exploration company, Blue Origin.ALEXANDRA: A man of diverse literary tastes. Heres another thing Im curious about. A lot of people in the publishing industry were worried when they heard Amazon planned to open bookstores, in part because they assumed Amazon would heavily promote books published through its own imprints. Amazon has had trouble getting those books into brick-and-mortar bookstores, which dont want to sell books by its No. 1 competitor. But Ive heard that the Amazon bookstore doesnt carry many Amazon Publishing titles. Is that how it looks to you?NICK: I just asked a store employee and was told theres no dedicated section for Amazon-published titles, though some of them are sprinkled around the store. There is, however, a small table near the front window called Books That Inspired Amazon Originals  that is, Amazon-produced TV series and movies. Philip K. Dicks The Man in the High Castle is there. Thats corporate synergy at work.ALEXANDRA: Its like advertising for their shows, but they can sell the advertising. Heres my biggest question about the bookstore. Amazon already has a huge market share of physical book sales through its website, 60 percent, by some estimates. So why does it need physical stores at all?NICK: Amazon, officially, wont tell you much about the motivations for doing bricks-and-mortar. But what I gather from my reporting is they have a lot of ideas about how physical retailing can be improved, ideas that come from their data-centric approach to online retailing. There is also a serendipity to book shopping offline thats hard to replicate online.By the way, I just saw a customer walking around with a copy of Donald Trumps The Art of the Deal. I dont know if hes purchasing it ironically.ALEXANDRA: An ironic purchase is still a purchase. I bet Trump and Amazon would agree on that.So, some Amazon skeptics have suggested that books are just going to be window-dressing and what Amazon really wants is a place to showcase its digital devices. Is there a prominent area for Amazon devices?NICK: Electronics, most of them made by Amazon, like Echo and Fire TV, are the nucleus of the store. Theyre spread out on tables and stands so you can fiddle with them just like you can fiddle with iPads at the Apple Store a short hop from here.Knowledgeable people tell me that Amazon views its physical stores as an important way to introduce the public to new, unfamiliar devices. Techies might be comfortable buying a device like the Echo online  a speaker and virtual assistant for the home  but a lot of people will want to see it in the flesh first. That said, I dont think Amazon stores would have saved the Fire Phone, the Amazon smartphone that belly-flopped. I should also say that books are not necessarily going to be the focus of all of the stores it opens in the future. Amazon intends to experiment.ALEXANDRA: Interesting. What else do you think it might sell in physical stores? Clothing? Pets? This is a company that delivers groceries and paper towels, makes award-winning television shows and wants to send tourists into space, so the possibilities seem pretty vast.NICK: Ive heard food is one of the things theyre considering.ALEXANDRA: One of the biggest questions right now is how many stores Amazon will open, and how quickly. A business professor speaking at a digital publishing conference this week speculated that it might open thousands of stores. There have been wild rumors that have sent other booksellers into a panic. What are you hearing?NICK: Thousands is a ludicrous number, at least in the short term. Ive heard dozens. Keep in mind that about 15 years after Apple opened its first store, it has fewer than 500 of them.ALEXANDRA:Still, even if the ambitions are modest in the short term, booksellers are definitely nervous about Amazons entry into physical retail. Independent bookstores are actually thriving right now, in part because sales of print books have stabilized and e-book sales are down. Publishing experts say physical stores are still the No. 1 way to drive discovery of books. And as you said, people still like browsing for books in stores. They like the serendipity of it. But if Amazon gains ground in brick and mortar retail, independents will lose their biggest advantage.Are people are in there browsing right now?NICK: Its lunchtime on a weekday and there is no food for sale in the store, so there are not many people. The biggest question I have is, are malls the best place for these stores? It feels like a busy urban shopping area with lots of foot traffic might work better.ALEXANDRA: Nick, sorry to send you on another scavenger hunt, but can you check to see if Brad Stones The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon is on the shelves? MacKenzie Bezos didnt like the book; she blasted it in a one-star review on Amazon.NICK: Wow, I just found it. They put it out of sight on a bottom shelf, but its there."}

{"text": "Oops, he did it again. The dazzling Mexican bel canto tenor Javier Camarena earned another rare encore at the Metropolitan Opera during Saturday afternoons performance of Donizettis Don Pasquale, which was broadcast live on the radio.It was the third encore he has sung at the Met, an honor that has only been awarded in modern memory to two other singers: Luciano Pavarotti, who sang one during a performance of Puccinis Tosca in 1994 and Juan Diego Flrez, who has sung several in recent years. (The Met chorus has performed encores of the famous Va, pensiero chorus in Verdis Nabucco, and some productions incorporate planned repeats of certain sections.) There was a time when Met programs warned, in capital letters, Positively no encores allowed.Saturdays came when Mr. Camarena received rapturous applause after singing the famous second act aria Povero Ernesto...Cercher lontana terra, and he was prevailed upon to sing a repeat of the final section, which is capped by a high D flat.There had been some speculation that something like that might happen before the run of Don Pasquale ended. In his review of the opera in The New York Times, Anthony Tommasini wrote that Mr. Camarena had excitedly sang the elaborate bel canto aria E se fia che ad altro oggetto, capped by a fearless high D flat and that the audience broke into such a frenzied ovation that I thought he just might return for an encore performance.Thats what the audience clearly wanted, Mr. Tommasini wrote. But he stayed backstage as the staging dictated, and the performance continued.Not so on Saturday. His encore during the radio broadcast was Mr. Camarenas third at the Met. In 2014, while filling in for Mr. Flrez in Rossinis La Cenerentola, he got such a thunderous ovation for performances of the bravura aria Si, ritrovarla io guiro, that he was compelled to sing encores.There are two more performances left of Don Pasquale, on Tuesday and Friday."}

{"text": "MOSCOW   A nonprofit group that promotes democracy has become the latest American-linked group to be banned in Russia under restrictions on undesirable organizations signed into law by President Vladimir V. Putin in May.The office of Russias prosecutor general on Thursday outlawed the group, the National Democratic Institute, claiming in a statement that the it posed a threat to the foundations of Russias constitutional order and national security.The restrictions on so-called undesirable organizations are meant to limit the influence of outside groups in Russia and to prevent what the Kremlin worried might be a foreign-sponsored uprising against the government.Russians are barred from working with organizations deemed to fall under the law, and the offices of such groups in Russia have been shut and their assets frozen. With the National Democratic Institute, five organizations have now been added to the list, all American-linked. They include the nonprofit National Endowment for Democracy, and the Open Society Foundations, a group founded by the billionaire George Soros to help countries make the transition from Communism. The MacArthur Foundation, which is based in Chicago and which awards grants for activities related to higher education, human rights and limiting the proliferation of nuclear weapons, closed its offices in Russia in July.Activists in Russia and farther afield have denounced the law as another government measure to stifle civil rights.In response to Russias move, the National Democratic Institute said in a statement that the legislation violates the basic rights of Russians to freedom of association and expression, which includes the ability to see, receive and impart information, including across borders.John Kirby, a State Department spokesman in Washington, said the United States rejected the notion that the National Democratic Institute and other international civil society groups were a threat to Russia.The National Democratic Institute, a group promoting democracy and civil society, had operated in Russia directly since the late 1980s, but it decided to close its offices there in 2012, according to its website. It has continued to establish programs in Russia through partner organizations, however. Madeleine K. Albright, an former United States secretary of state, is its chairwoman."}
{"text": "CHICAGO  With thousands of people already packed into stands and music blaring to warm up the crowd, Donald J. Trumps campaign abruptly canceled his rally here on Friday night over security concerns as protesters clashed with his supporters inside an arena where he was to speak.Minutes after Mr. Trump was to have taken to a podium on the campus of a large, diverse public university just west of downtown, an announcer suddenly pronounced the event over before it had begun. Hundreds of protesters, who had promised to be a visible presence here and filled several sections of the arena, let out an elated, unstopping cheer. Mr. Trumps supporters, many of whom had waited hours to see the Republican front-runner, seemed stunned and slowly filed out in anger.Around the country, protesters have interrupted virtually every Trump rally, but his planned appearance here  in a city run for decades by Democrats and populated by nearly equal thirds of blacks, Latinos and whites  had drawn some particularly incensed responses since it was announced days ago.The canceled rally came on a day that Mr. Trump sought to move past the primary fight, saying that the party needed to come together behind him.Elsewhere, Mr. Trumps security has tried to identify and exclude potential demonstrators before they enter his events, but large groups of protesters had waited in line for seats here, and engaged in tense disputes with Trump supporters even as the University of Illinois at Chicago Pavilion was still filling up. For more than an hour before the event was to begin, security teams led protesters out, one by one, but many more remained, sparring with Trump supporters.In a statement, Mr. Trumps campaign said that he has determined that for the safety of all of the tens of thousands of people that have gathered in and around the arena, tonights rally will be postponed to another date.Thank you very much for your attendance and please go in peace, the statement said.On MSNBC, Mr. Trump said that after meeting with the law enforcement authorities, I felt it was just safer. I dont want to see anybody get hurt.Asked about the images of people clashing at the rally, Mr. Trump said, Honestly, we have a very divided country.Mr. Trumps opponents, Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Ted Cruz and Gov. John Kasich, condemned the disruptions, but said Mr. Trump was responsible for the tenor of his rallies. Mr. Cruz said Mr. Trump affirmatively encourages violence.For hours, the Chicago police, along with university officers, the federal authorities and others, were out here in force. A Chicago police spokesman said that city law enforcement authorities were not consulted and had no role in canceling the event. The spokesman said there had been five arrests, two by the Chicago police, two by the universitys police and one by the Illinois State Police. The fire department said three people, including a police officer, were injured.The prospect of a Trump rally here had long been fraught with apprehension. This city has been in turmoil over questions of race and policing for months. The release in November of a video of the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, by a white Chicago police officer had set off weeks of protest.The University of Illinois at Chicago draws a significant share of students from Chicagos neighborhoods, and has a large number of international students, and planned protests were publicized on social media. Around 10,000 people had signed up on Facebook to take part in one anti-Trump march. Scores of faculty members had pleaded with administrators over allowing the rally in a letter, which read, in part: We also request that the university publicly distance itself from the event and make a statement that the Trump rally is an anathema to the mission of U.I.C.In the hours before the event, inside the 9,500-seat arena, Mr. Trumps backers were energized. Some dressed in outfits to match his, and chanted Trump! Trump! Trump! as they waited.But the situation grew tense as the size of the protest crowd became clear, and as some yelled anti-Trump slogans and skirmished with the supporters. Three men in T-shirts that read, Muslims United Against Trump, departed early on, delighting the pro-Trump crowd.Outside, a tense standoff mounted as well. A line stretched for blocks while ticketholders  a diverse mix of older whites wearing Trump gear and younger African-American and Muslim students  waited to be allowed inside. Some said they were devoted Trump fans eager to hear him speak in person. I believe in Trump absolutely, said Jana Hayek, a Chicagoan and stay-at-home mother, holding the hand of her 12-year-old son, Peter. I definitely agree with his immigration policy. Its important to control who comes into this country.A large group opposing Mr. Trump merrily taunted the people entering the stadium with shouts of Donald Trump has got to go and signs caricaturing Mr. Trump as a fascist with a Hitler mustache. (In one only-in-Chicago insult, a protester carried a sign reading, Trump puts ketchup on his hot dog.) And then, suddenly, an announcement declared the event over and repeated it several times.As people streamed out, supporters of Mr. Trump were angry and frustrated. Anthony Pieroni, 19, a student at the university and a Republican, said he was disappointed. I understand why people didnt want him to come here, he said. People were fighting, ripping up signs, going crazy. It was just a terrible idea.But protesters were jubilant, and celebrated along the intersections on the citys Near West Side. Some protesters shut down lanes of a nearby expressway.Arguments and small skirmishes broke out along the streets. At one point, the police rushed in, separating people.At least one man was hit on the head with a police baton, witnesses said, and blood could be seen coming from a gash on his face. A woman, also bloodied, was led away by police.They got the job done, Vickie Deanda, 54, an accountant from Chicago, said of the demonstrators. Someone has to object to this hatred. The people inside have a right to be there. But we have a right to be here, too."}
{"text": "TEMPE, Ariz.   The last few seconds ran off the clock in the final game of Arizona States hockey season in disheartening surroundings two weeks ago.The 5-2 loss to the United States 18-and-under national team was uninspiring. Arizona State lacked structure and discipline, skating off the ice at Gila River Arena in front of a sparse home crowd that, in all likelihood, would have been furious had more of them cared about the result.The defeat capped a 10-22-5 season for the Sun Devils, who lost, lost and lost some more during their inaugural season in N.C.A.A. Division I hockey. Only five of their victories came against Division I competition. At one point, Arizona State was outscored, 50-6, during an 11-game losing streak.Finishing a season in 59th place out of 60 Division I teams would normally be a disappointment. But Arizona States hockey program does not exist under normal circumstances.After the last game, I couldnt wait to wake up the next morning and go to work, Arizona State Coach Greg Powers said. I couldnt wait to get up and move towards the future and into our first full schedule of Division I-only opponents in 2016-17. We cant wait to get started and move into the future.Disappointment would appear to be a matter of perspective.For the Sun Devils, participating as a Division I program for the first time after years of success at the club level, a strong win-loss record was not what the season was measured on. The only Pacific-12 Conference university with a Division I program, Arizona State measured the season by steps made toward leading college hockeys inevitable westward expansion.In that, there were many.The collegiate hockey world welcomed us with open arms, Arizona State Athletic Director Ray Anderson said. The good news for us is that the hockey world out there understands now that were real and were serious about our program. We think this experience will put us on a quicker road to being consistently competitive.The remaining time on the road to on-ice success seems longer than the next 12 months. The arrival next season of goaltender Joey Daccord, an Ottawa Senators draft pick in 2015, should help. The Sun Devils also have the possibility of having three N.H.L. draft picks on next seasons roster and will add promising redshirts to replace some of the outmatched players they had to promote from their club team.But it may be unfair to expect Arizona State to even be close to a .500 record next season.Anderson said starting a program from scratch, similar to a professional expansion team, was a process. And noticeable improvement in the win-loss column might not be part of the process yet in Year 2.The more pertinent steps that Arizona State is looking to take are solidifying plans on a long-term arena on, or near, its Tempe campus, and identifying a conference to join.Arizona State will remain independent next season. Under this system, the Sun Devils played a hybrid schedule of N.C.A.A. and club-level opponents this season, but they will face only N.C.A.A. competition next season.Only seven of their 29 N.C.A.A. games last season were played at home. Five were played at the programs primary home, a tiny municipal skating rink nearby that was more accustomed to hosting public skates. The other two were played in Glendale at Gila River Arena, the home of the N.H.Ls Arizona Coyotes.Within three to four years, we will be in a permanent home for A.S.U. hockey, Anderson said. Gila River is a great arena, but its too far removed from campus to consider that a permanent home. A lot of the folks that will support us are our students. Thirty-five minutes, an hour and 15 minutes, depending on traffic, is too much to ask. Temporarily, well play some of our bigger games up there.Were wide open to downtown Phoenix. Thats on the table, as well as building a rink on campus.Anderson also said a partnership with the N.B.As Phoenix Suns or the Coyotes was a possibility. The Coyotes, also looking for a new home and long at odds with Glendale over leasing and operating costs with their arena, are an increasingly likely partner. The Suns, who play in the 24-year-old Talking Stick Resort Arena in downtown Phoenix, are also looking for a new facility. The Suns, the Coyotes and Arizona State do not reject the notion of the teams partnering.An arena solution is not nearly as pressing an issue for the success of the Suns or the Coyotes as it is for Arizona State, which may need to have its arena plans in motion to join a major conference.Each of the six Division I conferences, which are in the midst of their postseason tournaments, has expressed interest in adding Arizona State as a member. Western Collegiate Hockey Association Commissioner Bill Robertson provided insight why.Theyre a school that our conference has a keen interest in because they bring a lot of different elements to the table as being a member of a Power Five conference, Robertson said of the W.C.H.A., which includes four teams in Michigan, two in Minnesota and two in Alaska.Theyre part of their own network in the Pac-12 Network. I believe they have the ability to bring other schools into the mix in terms of potentially joining Division I college hockey in the future. Arizona State brings a lot of different variables to the table.Those variables might not yet include many victories."}

{"text": "lvaro Enrigue, a Mexican author who lives in New York, must be having some fun when people ask what his latest novel is about. In no particular order, Sudden Death concerns: the tale of four tennis balls made from the hair of a beheaded Anne Boleyn; a fictional tennis match between the Italian painter Caravaggio and the Spanish poet Francisco de Quevedo; Cortss conquest of Mexico; and the history of various ball games. It also includes a few emails purporting to be an exchange between the author and an editor in Spain, as well as references to Thomas Mores Utopia, Galileo and the Aztec emperor Cuauhtmoc. And theres a dialogue featuring Pope Pius IV. What isnt Enrigues novel about?These characters and settings converge with some surprising results in a book that tests the limits of historical fiction, then writes a few new rules for it. Like a movie director trying to manage an unwieldy ensemble cast, Enrigue has pulled off a script where both Montezuma and Henry VIII have parts to play. The acting is superb, the lighting enchanting. Theres just one problem, something a little empty at the center of this Renaissance-era Love Actually. At times, Enrigues historical showpiece is all brains and too little heart.The novel opens with a description of a 16th-century tennis match, which will end in the sudden death that gives the book its title. Monks used to play tennis, and their ideas about the sport were very different from ours. It was a matter of death and the afterlife, writes Enrigue. The ball as allegory of the soul flitting between good and evil, scheming to get into heaven, Lucifers messengers waylaying it.This section also includes some details on the rules  no nets or lines  and information on something called a dedans, which was what they called the opening on the court used for scoring. Its worth paying attention here because more than a dozen chapters, spliced in throughout the book, will narrate this match between Quevedo and Caravaggio  Wimbledon with men in tights. They have decided to duel with rackets rather than swords.Now its off to the court of Henry VIII in time to watch the beheading of Anne Boleyn. Jean Rombaud is a famed French swordsman brought in to finish the queen off swiftly. For payment, he takes her hair, intending to use it to make tennis balls (the sports first balls were made of human or horsehair or wool), which he plans to sell to the King of France in exchange for a title. All goes well until the French kings minister double-crosses him, executing the executioner.Enrigue writes under the dark star of Jorge Luis Borges, which gives the book some of its ironic spring, certainly its loveliest trait. Sudden Death is dog-eared with Borgesian influences, from the out-of-nowhere citations, said to be derived from obscure Renaissance texts, to the novels tiny chapters, most only a few pages long. You can also detect hints of the Chilean writer Roberto Bolao, though maybe these are just fingerprints from the translator, Natasha Wimmer, who also translated many of Bolaos novels.Enrigues charm can work in unexpected ways, as in several chapters presented as email exchanges with an editor, who delivers the age-old reminder of an approaching deadline and bandies with the author about the derivation of certain tennis terms. Its the kind of postmodern flirtation almost guaranteed to irritate, but somehow it works. Who cares if some of the messages are fake?It was the part about Corts in Mexico that let me down. Ive had plenty of Boleyn and Henry, thanks to Wolf Hall, but theres far less good fiction about the fall of Mexico. Its just as dramatic  ships deliberately destroyed in what is now Veracruz; the march to the Aztec capital, where beating hearts are pulled from chests and severed heads roll down pyramid steps  and arguably more relevant today. The conquistadors caused more planetary aftershocks than the equally monumental falls of Jerusalem and Constantinople, Enrigue writes.I agree  and so I wanted a lot more of that. There are some naughty sex scenes between Corts and his Maya princess mistress and a few reflections by an Aztec nobleman on how life changed after Corts. But these passages didnt add up to the sweeping, deadly merger of civilizations Enrigue seems to have set out to paint. Thats because he needs to get back to the Medicis, the Montaltos and more. With another 100 pages, this scheme might just have worked. But at the present novels slim length, no one seems to have a chance to breathe, not least Caravaggio and Quevedo, puffing away on that tennis court.So whats the real subject of Sudden Death? I dont know what this book is about, Enrigue writes at one point. Its not exactly about a tennis match. Nor is it a book about the slow and mysterious integration of America into what we call the Western world  an outrageous misapprehension, since from the American perspective, Europe is the East. Maybe its just a book about how to write this book; maybe thats what all books are about.Im not so sure. Enrigue is an ambitious author who appears to want his book to be about many things. Instead Sudden Death comes across as the product of a talented writer whose mind was bristling with facts and dates and names, but who somehow allowed them to overshadow his characters. We meet Caravaggio, Quevedo, Corts and Montezuma, but were not given enough time to get to know them in this hasty rendezvous with history."}
{"text": "In an article about the Brooklyn Navy Yard last fall, Chris Terrell, a wine importer, described what it was like to run a business inside the 300-acre walled industrial park. Its literally like working in a federal prison, he said, referring to the security checkpoints. If thats your fetish, get there quickly, because the rusted old shipyard, which New York City bought from the federal government in 1966, is rapidly going the way of the rest of Brooklyn, with a small-batch distillery and rooftop farm already in place and a cavernous food hall featuring an outpost of Russ & Daughters, a purveyor of smoked fish and Jewish delicacies, on the way. The yard, which has long been closed to everyone but employees and their guests, is in the process of opening up, with more than 300 industrial tenants currently humming and promises of wider public access in the near future. If you hand-slice Nova, they will come.But the old maritime behemoths are not gone yet. The photographer Emon Hassan, accompanied by a security escort on two recent Sundays, explored some of the unchanged corners of the yard, concentrated near the old dry docks that Arthur Miller, a former ship worker, commemorated in his short story Fitters Night.Mr. Hassan, who is also a filmmaker, said he was disappointed that his escort would not let him into some decrepit buildings, like the old naval quarters or the historic residences of Admirals Row. But he was moved by the spectral interplay of old and new, as one creakily gave way to the other. With the Navy Yard, I imagined the thousands of lives who had worked there and interacted with those objects, many of which are now abandoned, he wrote in an email. In essence, I approached the structures as witnesses to the history of the Navy Yard and tried to capture what they were telling me."}
{"text": "Midway through Miles Ahead, the soon-to-be-released movie about Miles Davis, directed by and starring Don Cheadle, the famously irascible musician tells a freelance writer (played by Ewan McGregor) in a dowdy corduroy blazer, Youre not driving me around looking like that no more.Its 1979. Earth, Wind & Fires Getaway had just been blasting on the stereo in Daviss West 77th Street apartment. He slides open the door to a walk-in closet and the journalist sees a collection of silks, furs, scarves and lam jackets.From Brooks Brothers sharp to Issey Miyake prints, leather and bright colors, Miles wore it all and was always cool doing it, Mr. Cheadle said. He made the clothes.Gersha Phillips, the costume designer who also made all the clothes for Miles Ahead, including a kimono in habutai, did not know how fashionable the trumpeter was until she started her research. I was quite amazed, she said. I just feel like he was always forward-thinking, and just the way he was with his music he was with fashion: ahead of his time.The main action takes place as Davis is considering a comeback after a five-year, self-imposed exile on the Upper West Side, with deft swings back to the 1950s and 60s. No matter the decade  as a sideman to Charlie Parker in the 1940s; birthing cool jazz with Gil Evans in the early 50s; moving further ahead with John Coltrane in the late-50s and then the mid-60s, before an electric period from 1968-75  Davis is the focal point, in part because of what he wore.With Davis, it wasnt a case of style over substance. His style was essential to his substance.His music, of course, everyone is familiar with, said Marcus Miller, the bassist, composer and producer who was part of Daviss band in 1980. But when I knew him, he was painting as much as playing, and that was a real reflection of him, as well  and then his clothes. It was all the same thing. It was a statement of who he was and how he wanted to present himself.He was conscious that people were looking at him, Mr. Miller said. And the clothes were so important back then, particularly in the 40s and 50s, because this was an era when black artists were fighting to be recognized as more than simple entertainers. It was like, Were going to be as sharp as possible and were going to command respect.He grew up like that, said the tenor saxophonist and composer Wayne Shorter, who also played with Davis. He always dressed well, always in tune with fine things, and he didnt see any reason why fine things should be denied to anyone.Miles Dewey Davis III was born into upper-middle-class comfort in Alton, Ill., in 1926. His father was an oral surgeon and his mother was a music teacher; the family moved to East St. Louis when Davis was 1.In his profane and profound 1989 autobiography, written with Quincy Troupe, he credited his mother for his fashion sense. She had mink coats, diamonds, he wrote. She was a very glamorous woman who was into all kinds of hats and things, and all my mothers friends seemed just as glamorous to me as she was. She always dressed to kill. I got my looks from my mother and also my love of clothes and sense of style.Later, he took his cues from movie stars like Fred Astaire and Cary Grant. I created a kind of hip, quasi-black English look: Brooks Brothers suits, butcher boy shoes, high top pants, shirts with high tab collars that were so stiff with starch I could hardly move my neck, he wrote.In late-1940s New York, when West 52nd was known as Swing Street, Coleman Hawkins, a titanic figure in jazz, was a role model for the young Davis: Bean taught me a lot about music, Miles wrote, using Hawkinss nickname. Plus he used to give me clothes, he wrote. He bought the clothes from a hip store on Broadway and 52nd Street, then gave them to me for almost nothing.The debonair saxophonist Dexter Gordon was another sartorial influence. Dexter hipped me to the importance of looking sharp, Davis wrote. I thought he was the cleanest cat around.Like many jazz musicians, Davis was hampered in the early 50s by heroin addiction, which took about four years to kick. When he finally did, he credited the discipline he observed in the boxer Sugar Ray Robinson. Davis eventually took up a boxing program to stay fit; its one of the reasons clothes draped so well on him.As difficult as Davis was  and Mr. Cheadles film doesnt shy away from this  he didnt pressure his bandmates to dress a certain way. He left it up to us, Mr. Shorter said. Except when I first joined his band, he sent me to his tailor, who was down the street from his home, and he got me a tuxedo made to open up at the Hollywood Bowl.Herbie Hancock, who was in the same group (and who, like Mr. Shorter, makes a cameo in Miles Ahead), said, When I first joined his band, the idea of playing with Miles meant you automatically sensed that you would wear something that was appropriate for Miless kind of presentation.Davis, who died in 1991, was a rock star before there were rock stars, gangsta long before hip-hop. He had run-ins with police, especially when he was in one of his Ferraris. In the late 60s, he was stopped outside the Plaza Hotel for not having a registration sticker. In his memoir, Davis cited a different reason for this brush with the law: I was sitting in my red Ferrari, dressed in a turban, cobra-skinned pants and a sheepskin coat, with a real fine woman.In 1969, when he was the victim of a drive-by shooting, his sense of style may have saved his life: The guy must have shot five bullets at me, but I had on a leather suit that was kind of loose-fitting, Davis wrote. If it hadnt been for that leather jacket and the fact they shot through the door of a well-built Ferrari, I would have been dead.Davis was not afraid to change with the times, either in the music he made or in the way he dressed. In the late 1960s he wore dashikis and loose Indian shirts and suede pants from the young African-American designer Stephen Burrows.He adapted his style, once again, in the early 1980s. I remember once, in 1981, Im hanging out in his house, Mr. Miller said, and he said, Find me something to wear. So I went into the closet and it was all the baddest stuff Id ever seen. But they were all from, like, 1973. Everything was bell-bottoms, fringes, vests, everything had 14 colors. I came out and said, Miles, I cant find anything for you in there, theyre too old. And he said, Oh, man! and walked in there and cobbled something together. But once he got back on his feet, 82, 83, he began to re-establish himself in terms of his style.Envelope-pushing Japanese designers like Kohshin Satoh sent him stuff. In 1987, Davis modeled for a Satoh presentation at the Tunnel with Andy Warhol. He also wore his designs during a White House visit with Cicely Tyson, his wife at the time.Miles was always the hippest guy around, Mr. Hancock said. The way he moved, the way he walked, the way he stood when he played, what came out of his horn, and the cars he drove, all of that was stylish. That was part of his persona."}
{"text": "Wage insurance may not be on your radar, but it should be. It helps people who have lost their jobs and cannot find new ones that pay as well. That assistance can reduce economic inequality while providing incentives for unemployed people to go back to work quickly.Whats more, wage insurance has bipartisan support, at least in its current limited form. We ought to expand it, both through government and in the private sector.Canada experimented with wage insurance in 1995, and six years later Lori G. Kletzer, now of Colby College, and Robert E. Litan, adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, advocated its use in the United States in an aptly named paper, A Prescription to Relieve Worker Anxiety. The idea caught on: President George W. Bush and Congress embraced it in 2002, and last June President Obama extended a form of wage insurance through 2021.There is a catch, though. The Bush-Obama insurance is limited to people who have lost their jobs to foreign workers. If a computer is now doing the work you used to do, this insurance wont help you.The current insurance has other limits, too. It is restricted to American workers over the age of 50 who have been earning wages up to $50,000 a year, were employed full time and had to take a different, lower-paying job. For people in such circumstances, the insurance provides an amount equal to half the difference in pay, for two years, capped at a total of $10,000.By some measures, the $50,000 earnings cutoff is fairly generous: It is almost twice the median annual earnings of American women in 2014, $28,000, for example. The insurance is administered by the states. In New York State, for example, the local New York State Career Center is the place to go for this kind of assistance.President Obama recognizes that the current program does not go far enough. In his State of the Union address in January and in his budget for fiscal year 2017 he proposed a significant expansion. While maintaining the $50,000 income threshold, he would drop the age requirement as well as the link to job loss because of foreign competition.These changes are critical. After all, most working people in the United states are under 50, and most job loss cannot be clearly attributed to replacement by foreign workers. Technology is making some jobs obsolete, and factors like recessions and shifts in demand for products and services eliminate many jobs. In this expansion, described in a recent White House blog post by Jason Furman, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and Jeffrey Zients, director of the National Economic Council, wage insurance would help many people who desperately need it. We can expect some opposition to it, though, simply because it would increase the role of government.But it remains insurance, and in a vibrant capitalist economy, expanding it makes sense on theoretical grounds. Insurance is a type of risk management. Rational people would want to pay for this benefit so that they could take promising but risky employment opportunities. It could help spur innovation in the economy.With a potentially expensive program, financing is critical. Like Social Security, an expanded wage insurance system might best be financed by a payroll tax. To be fair, people with wages just below the $50,000 limit  who might receive more money from the program than lower-income workers  should pay higher premiums. True insurance needs to be priced appropriately.There is another objection to wage insurance. It can create a moral hazard  an incentive to take a lower-paying, and perhaps less demanding, job than the one the person lost. Most people will agree that people who want to work harder and at unpleasant jobs to earn more income should not be discouraged from doing so. There is a safeguard against this in the current plan, which limits benefits to two years. That reduces moral hazard, but at the expense of providing benefits with a longer horizon. There are always trade-offs.The role of government is important in this case because for social insurance, governments have a significant advantage in putting into place big ideas that are difficult to market. That was true for federal Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance in the Social Security system starting in 1935, which was followed by an explosion of additional private pension, life insurance and disability plans. Government is needed again now.But ultimately, there should be two insurance systems, a government one that is limited to assisting lower-income workers and a private one that allows everyone  including those with higher incomes  to buy insurance against wage loss.In my book The New Financial Order, I proposed a private sector form of wage insurance that I called livelihood insurance. It would be an extension of disability insurance, which is already marketed and sold by private insurance companies. It would just add specified job market problems to the list of covered disabilities. For example, it might include a decline in income for, say, nurses, or a decline in the number of people employed in nursing, or some combination of the two, with payments not just for two years but for as long as the condition persisted. Such insurance policies would be based on objective marketwide factors for a persons occupation, reducing the possibility that the insurance might encourage people to take less demanding jobs.Appropriate pricing for livelihood insurance would also avoid selection bias  people with exceptionally insecure jobs signing up in disproportionately large numbers  a problem that government wage insurance can avoid by being offered to everyone.If the private sector offered livelihood insurance, people in riskier careers would be charged higher insurance premiums. At the same time, by reducing wage risk, the insurance would encourage people to be more adventuresome and entrepreneurial. Risk management and insurance costs might then become essential elements of career planning. Employers in risky industries might buy livelihood insurance for their employees as a benefit.If these concepts seem unfamiliar, that is partly because privately issued livelihood insurance is not common today, if it exists at all. But that could change quickly. Expanding government wage insurance now might clear the way for the private sector. At a time of rising economic inequality and job dislocation, wage insurance makes a great deal of sense."}

It has to do with the unexpected, unbidden, unavoidable, virtually silent, persistent, ulteriorly motivated appearance of these animals.Is That Kafka? collects these letters and 98 other pieces of trivia and ephemera about the author. Reiner Stach compiled the material while writing his three-part biography of Kafka, the first two volumes of which have been published so far in the United States.In the only surviving letter to Kafka from a reader, Siegfried Wolff says he was unhappy after buying The Metamorphosis for a cousin: She doesnt know how to make sense of the story. My cousin gave it to her mother, but she cant find an explanation either. Her mother gave the book to my other cousin and she doesnt have an explanation either. Now theyve written to me. Im supposed to explain the story to them. Because Im the Doctor in the family. But Im at a loss.A few photos in the book wouldnt feel out of place in a Sebald novel, particularly a haunting shot of what may be Kafka and his friend Max Brod in the crowd at an air show in 1909, which would have been the first time Kafka had seen a plane.In his final years, Kafka wrote two wills in the form of letters to Brod, saying that only his published books matter to him, and even those only so much: I dont mean that I wish for them to be reprinted and passed down to posterity, on the contrary, if they were to be completely forgotten, that would be in keeping with my actual wishes.

{"text": "Im not partial to Caribbean food but after several visits to Vital in Montclair, I fell in love with it. And Im not alone. Everyone I brought into the bright and festive restaurant on a busy stretch of Bloomfield Avenue was also smitten. The laid-back atmosphere is one reason; the large, colorful room accented with green walls and turquoise cloth napkins radiates that incongruous mix of luxury and insouciance that distinguishes the best Caribbean resorts. Its funky in the nicest possible way.Food, however, is the most important reason to visit Vital. Prepared by Kwame Williams, the chef who owns the restaurant with his two sisters, it is the most alluring Caribbean food I have eaten off-island.Mr. Williams, 34, knows his craft. A veteran of the Ryland Inn in Whitehouse Station, Bernards Inn in Bernardsville, and the Highlawn Pavilion in West Orange, he manages to create dishes that you would expect to find in a more buttoned-up (and, certainly, a more expensive) restaurant.That he cares deeply about health and sustainable agriculture, and still manages to create rich, novel dishes that go far beyond the usual coconut-besotted, excessively salty, fried or jerk-saturated staples, adds to Vitals appeal.The name is also apt: Espoused by the Rastafari movement, Ital cuisine (the term derives from the English vital) celebrates natural foods and avoids those made with additives and preservatives. Ital food is vegetarian, but Vitals offerings include a mix of vegan, vegetarian and those made with goat, oxtail, chicken, seafood and beef that any paleo could love.The creamy callaloo dip, served as an appetizer, is similar in texture to a spinach and artichoke dip, but Mr. Williams has reconstructed it in a wholly wonderful and new way. Instead of the usual dairy components, like sour cream and cream cheese, he adds coconut milk. He carmelizes onions, muting the harsh flavor of the mineral-rich callaloo (a leafy vegetable). Flecks of scotch bonnet peppers leave a pleasant tingling sensation on the tongue.Finally, instead of frying up huge batches in the morning, Mr. Williams fries to order each serving of the whole wheat chips that accompany the dish. The results are crisp chips without an oily residue, the perfect vehicle for scooping up creamy mouthfuls of the dip.At Vital, hummus is boldly reconfigured. Mr. Williams substitutes the usual chickpeas with black-eyed peas that are similar to the pigeon peas used in Jamaica. Instead of tahini, he adds hemp seeds (for extra protein and to appeal to diners with nut allergies, he said). Concentrated lemon juice gives commercial hummus a metallic flavor. Mr. Williams replaces it with more mellow orange juice. The result is stunning. If only Whole Foods sold it.A chefs talent often shows in his rethinking of the mundane. Take Mr. Williamss spinach salad. Strips of fresh mango, ripe even when I ordered the dish in February, enliven the delicate leaves and strips of red pepper. Cilantro in the house-made vinaigrette highlights the juicy sweetness of the fruit. This is a salad that serves its actual purpose: to pique your appetite for the dishes that follow.The best of these include the chefs oneof-a-kind cod cake, prepared with an abundance of fresh cod and only enough yam filler to bind the cake; a bowl of curried cauliflower ladled over coconut rice and kale sauted in canola oil; and his justly popular coconut shrimp.I fought the idea for as long as I could, said Mr. Williams, who did not want to serve a dish that had become a clich. After the one-year mark, I caved and made it for parties. Then guests started clamoring for it.No wonder they clamored. The fresh shrimp are soaked in coconut milk quickly and lightly fried to order in a coating of plantain flour. Yucca fries are similarly crisp and golden; the fried okra that you can order as a side is another example of deep-frying wizardry.A light vegan coconut ice cream is available for dessert, as is a richer, nonvegan rum raisin made by Guernsey Crest Ice Cream in Paterson, where the Williams siblings spent time during childhood visiting their grandparents.Vital is a family affair in other ways: Mr. Williamss older sister, Nataki Williams, 38, is in charge of finance; their younger sister, Kanika Williams, 31, handles catering and events.Other reasons to visit Vital include the jerk chicken wrap available at lunch, the live and mostly reggae music on Friday evenings and the shots of bee pollen, hemp protein and moringa, which are also available in smoothies.Are they the reason for the energy that seems to animate the room? A stronger factor is the food. Short of flying to the Carribean, I can think of no better way to escape winter."}
{"text": "AS the director of the human brain bank at the National Institute of Mental Health, I am surrounded by brains, some floating in jars of formalin and others icebound in freezers. As part of my work, I cut these brains into tiny pieces and study their molecular and genetic structure. My specialty is schizophrenia, a devastating disease that often makes it difficult for the patient to discern what is real and what is not. I examine the brains of people with schizophrenia whose suffering was so acute that they committed suicide. I had always done my work with great passion, but I dont think I really understood what was at stake until my own brain stopped working.In the first days of 2015, I was sitting at my desk when something freakish happened. I extended my arm to turn on the computer, and to my astonishment realized that my right hand disappeared when I moved it to the right lower quadrant of the keyboard. I tried again, and the same thing happened: The hand disappeared completely as if it were cut off at the wrist. It felt like a magic trick  mesmerizing, and totally inexplicable. Stricken with fear, I kept trying to find my right hand, but it was gone.I had battled breast cancer in 2009 and melanoma in 2012, but I had never considered the possibility of a brain tumor. I knew immediately that this was the most logical explanation for my symptoms, and yet I quickly dismissed the thought. Instead I headed to a conference room. My colleagues and I had a meeting scheduled to review our new data on the molecular composition of schizophrenia patients frontal cortex, a brain region that shapes who we are  our thoughts, emotions, memories. But I couldnt focus on the meeting because the other scientists faces kept vanishing. Thoughts about a brain tumor crept quietly into my consciousness again, then screamed for attention.The M.R.I. scan later that day showed that I indeed had a small brain tumor that was bleeding and blocking my right visual field. I was told it was metastatic melanoma and given what was, in effect, a death sentence. I was a scientist, a triathlete, a wife, mother and grandmother. Then one day my hand vanished, and it was over.Almost right away, I had brain surgery, which removed the tumor and the blood. I quickly regained my vision. Unfortunately, new lesions were popping up throughout my brain, small but persistent. I started getting radiation treatments. In the spring, I entered an immunotherapy clinical trial. It was shortly before the end of this treatment that my brain really went awry.It was difficult, at first, to pinpoint the changes in my behavior, because they came on slowly. I didnt suddenly become someone else. Rather, some of my normal traits and behaviors became exaggerated and distorted, as if I were turning into a caricature of myself. I had always been very active, but now I was rushing about frantically. I had no time for anything  not even for the things that I really enjoyed, like talking to my children and my sister on the telephone. I would cut them off midsentence, running somewhere to do something of great importance, though what exactly, I couldnt say. I became rude, and snapped at anyone who threatened to distract me. I would read a paragraph and forget it instantly. I got lost driving home from work on a route I had taken for decades. I went running in the woods outside my house, barely dressed.Strangely, I wasnt worried. Like so many patients with mental illness, whose brains I had studied for a lifetime, I was losing my grasp on reality.I came up with elaborate justifications for my behavior. I had reasons for everything I did, and even if I couldnt articulate these reasons, my certainty that they existed reinforced my belief that I was perfectly sane. I kept sending my doctor detailed emails about how great I was feeling. I was excited that I had completed immunotherapy. I felt certain that there was nothing wrong with my brain. This wasnt just wishful thinking, or extreme denial; my worldview made perfect sense to me. I still saw myself as a scientist  a master of the rational  and was in fact still working hard on other peoples brains, not able to see that my own was crashing.One day, when I was acting particularly strangely, my family took me to the emergency room. A brain scan showed many new tumors, inflammation and severe swelling. My frontal cortex was especially affected. I had studied this area of the brain for 30 years; I knew what that kind of swelling meant, and yet I showed no interest in the scans. Instead, I believed that my doctor and my family were scheming behind my back and making a mistake by giving in to unreasonable panic. I was frustrated that no one saw the world as clearly as I did.Despite my conviction that there was nothing really wrong with me, I took the drugs that were prescribed. Steroids reduced the swelling and inflammation. Then the visible tumors were destroyed by radiation. I was also placed on a new drug regimen intended to kill the melanoma cells in my body. Gradually my brain began to work again. Memories started coming back, as if I had awakened from a deep sleep. I could tell the days apart. I could find my way home from work. I began apologizing left and right for my strange actions and insensitive behavior. But the more I remembered, the more frightened I was that I might lose my mind again.The underlying causes of mental illness are rarely as clear as metastatic brain cancer. And yet I felt I understood for the first time what many of the patients I study go through  the fear and confusion of living in a world that doesnt make sense; a world in which the past is forgotten and the future is utterly unpredictable. I had tried to fill the gaps with guesses. But when my guesses were wrong, conspiracy theories crawled in.As terrifying as it was for me, it was even more terrifying for my family. For them it was not just the prospect of my death that was shockingly painful, but the possibility that my persona, who I was  my brain  might change so profoundly that I would, in effect, vanish before I was truly gone. Or as my daughter put it, Mom, I thought I had already lost you.My latest M.R.I. scan shows that almost all the tumors in my brain have disappeared or shrunk considerably. Against all odds, the combination of treatments has been effective. I still scrutinize my emotions and behaviors, examining my mind over and over for any loose ends. It remains an obsession. But I am learning to delight in the fact that my brain works again. I can see the sunny street outside, and make total sense of it. I can ever so casually extend my arm and call my children, and they will recognize my voice and sigh with relief. I can flick on my computer, and get back to work."}
{"text": "Britain and France may have a historically complicated relationship, but this has never stood in the way of their longstanding connection through fine dining. In this culinary minuet, France has always led by bestowing its food and wines on an island it deems gastronomically benighted, and Britain has shown its gratitude by revering French cooking more than any European country aside from Belgium and maybe Switzerland.Recently, however, a new generation of London chefs has taken French cooking and made it its own. One example of this Anglo-French cuisine can be found at Piquet, the new bistro where the chef Allan Pickett, 43, coaxes the best out of British produce with a mastery of classical French technique learned at Galvin Bistrot de Luxe and Orrery, two of Londons best French restaurants.Mr. Picketts place is a two-in-one spot that opened in a duplex just north of Soho last September. A cozy bar offers an appealing menu of small plates like an irresistible pairing of pork crackling and crab meat to accompany well-mixed cocktails. But its downstairs, in a wood-paneled dining room, that Mr. Picketts cooking really shines.The duck rillettes that began a recent dinner revealed Mr. Picketts skills as a charcutier. More striking were the freshness and ingenuity that guide his cooking in other starters, like marinated Scottish sea scallops with pickled apple balls and squid ink and a crab meat-filled raviolo in a ruddy shellfish sauce punctuated by crunchy, salty samphire.Main courses like roasted sea bass with cauliflower pure or crispy and custardy veal sweetbreads on wilted Romaine with a Madeira sauce displayed the very British love of savory and fruity flavors, often in the same dish, which has become the rudder of Mr. Picketts otherwise assiduously Gallic cuisine. Standout desserts included blood-orange sorbet with citrus shortbread and a Yorkshire rhubarb tart with cream.In a city with too many tables courting expense-account extravagance, Piquet stands out by offering beautifully sourced and cooked food at reasonable prices. And with casual kitchens as good as Piquet, Britain is showing France that it can lead every bit as well as its always followed."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Use of Heroin in Public View Across the U.S. (front page, March 7):Until they are ready for treatment and have access to it, people with an addiction to heroin will find a place to inject, whether its in a fast-food restaurant bathroom, a church basement, a public bus or an abandoned building. Making restrooms inaccessible will only push the problem elsewhere.Nurse-supervised safe injection sites like Insite in Vancouver, Canada, have been demonstrated to save lives and provide a pathway toward recovery. We need to follow suit.MARK EISENBERGBrookline, Mass.The writer is a doctor of internal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital and on the faculty of Harvard Medical School.To the Editor:The recent increase in heroin use in Boston and throughout the country should come as no surprise to anyone. Following an increase in the prescribing of opioid painkillers, a number of steps were taken to reduce such prescribing markedly, but with no attention whatever paid to the patients who had become dependent, not even offers of detoxification.Many, predictably, turned to the much cheaper and widely available alternative of heroin.The only tangential reference to treatment in your article is the statement that a particular stretch of Massachusetts Avenue is known as Methadone Mile. Would that it were so! Along with all other forms of treatment, methadone maintenance  the gold standard of care  should be readily available to all who want and need help for their dependence, and who with tragic frequency die without it.SUSAN G. GEVERTZScarsdale, N.Y.The writer is a health care consultant.To the Editor:Its not easy to understand heroin addicts. They eschew replacement drugs like methadone and Suboxone that reduce sickness and cravings so they can shoot up and experience that momentary rush and ephemeral bliss. Many of them know that they are chasing that first high, that first time that opened the door to heaven and hell.Shooting up is an extraordinary experience, but as much as they try, addicts will not get that first high again. For these people, life holds little meaning or joy outside of getting high. Their addiction gives them a reason to exist, a focus and its rewards.Many heroin addicts have found a way out by giving purpose to their lives. Helping others is a path we choose to walk. Great wisdom can be achieved by having lived on the dark side and then putting the madness behind us. I was once that junkie in the bathroom.

{"text": "The diamonds dazzle, the sapphires sparkle, the emeralds enchant. But for many women and jewelry connoisseurs, it is the soft call of coral that lures them.Its been a trend for some time, said Bart Peers of Epoque Fine Jewels, a Brussels-based dealer that specializes in 19th- and 20th-century fine jewelry. While 19th-century pieces and Italian revival necklaces have long been popular, Mr. Peers said, with the current trend of vintage jewelry, there is a shift in interest, as a lot of vintage jewelry from the 1940s, 50s and 60s also has coral in it  the famous three colors of onyx, coral and diamond, usually set in gold.There are both practical and aesthetic reasons for this rise in corals popularity, jewelry dealers say. At Sothebys, for instance, experts sense that it is not coral itself that is growing in appeal but vintage pieces.While Art Deco continues to be the most popular era for jewelry buffs, Brett OConnor, one of the houses specialists, noted that such pieces are becoming harder to find. But people still want color and good craftsmanship, he said, and you can find great 20th-century signed jewels at a great price point  especially from the 1950s to 70s.That desire for color and craftsmanship intersects with jewelry aesthetics.Corallium rubrum, the red coral largely found in the Mediterranean along the Italian coast and most often used by Europeans for haute joaillerie, the finest jewelry, can range from the palest peach blossom hues to deep, fiery reds. It can be sculpted into roses; carved into cameos; rounded or squared into beads, links and chains; and smoothed into cabochons. (Other corals, such as the red, white and black of the corallium japonicum and corallium konjoin, from the Pacific, are the favorites of Asian jewelers.) Yet the gem is very wearable, Mr. Peers noted. Comfortable, not too showy. It is dressed, but its never overkill; chic, but never too glamorous.Christian Hemmerle, a Munich-based jeweler who uses coral in many of his creations, also praises the material. Our collectors tend to be confident and open-minded with a real eye for the unusual and the unique, he said in an email, so coral appeals as each piece has its own form, texture and aesthetic, usually with imperfections that add to its individuality.The history of coral jewelry in Europe dates at least to ancient Rome, where it was believed to protect children and ward against evil. Pliny the Elder is said to have recommended coral to protect against the allure of temptresses. Renaissance paintings of the Christ Child often depict him holding or wearing protective coral amulets, and Mediterranean coral from Trapani, Sicily, was especially treasured during the French Empire.During the 1920s, European designers of Art Deco pieces prized coral as a way to introduce color into jewelry, mixing it with onyx, diamonds, lacquer or lapis lazuli in everything from pendants, rings and brooches to combs and other hair ornaments.And in the 1970s, while raw coral, polished but left in its natural, branch-like form, was a hot accessory for hippies, jewelers such as Boucheron carved dark pink roses and orange-red cabochons that they set with textured gold and diamonds.Today, houses like Dior and Cartier continue to use coral in their designs but concern about its scarcity  the result of centuries of overharvest  have led many jewelers to reconsider. Some, like Tiffany and Company, have stopped working with coral altogether; others work only with older pieces.One such jeweler is the German designer Otto Jakob, who like Epoque exhibits annually at the European Fine Art Fair, better known as Tefaf, in Maastricht, the Netherlands. The elite event, which began on March 11, draws some of the worlds pre-eminent jewelers and jewelry dealers to present the best of their collections alongside Old Masters, 20th-century master works and precious antiques and antiquities.It was a 2014 visit to the regional museum in Trapani that profoundly influenced many of his designs, said Mr. Jakob, who is based in Karlsruhe, Germany. Inspired by the ways in which Trapani jewelers imbedded coral into gold, he both emulates and, as it were, reverses the process: sculpting indentations into raw coral and occasionally other materials. He then embellishes the cells with enamel or fills them with precious metals, carved ornaments or diamonds.Still, he is conscientious when using the gem, which he reverently describes as the grave of the ancestors of the living corals. He uses only specimens acquired early in his career  his fascination with corals dates to the 1980s  and which he has kept, like personal treasure, ever since. Its a sacred material, said Mr. Jakob, who added that he uses it only when my ideas feel thrilling and magnificent.Similarly, Mr. Hemmerle keeps to older coral, sourcing pieces from antique dealers worldwide, although not only for environmental reasons. We like working with antique coral for its distinct colors that vary from vibrant red to creamy orange with subtle nuances in tone, he said.Environmental concerns about coral reefs may soon create difficulties for jewelers, however, especially for those who trade corallium rubrum internationally. (Several other coral species already have been declared endangered and are subject to strict export regulations.)The Trapani reefs have long since died out, and other colonies of corallium rubrum now also risk extinction, stressed by pollution and overfishing.Consequently, regulations from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, an international trade agreement among more than 180 countries, restrict the export of red coral harvested after 1969. And activists are working to tighten those restrictions throughout Europe and in the United States.Nonetheless, passionate coral lovers are likely to be undeterred. In fact, the rarity of the material has increased its collectability, Mr. Hemmerle said  something auction houses already are discovering.In December, for instance, Christies sold several coral pieces at its Magnificent Jewels sale in New York, including an Art Deco coral, diamond and onyx bracelet by Cartier that sold for nearly $450,000. Its price estimate had been $80,000 to $120,000.Mr. Peers understands that passion well. Weve seen so many diamonds that in the end, we are eager to see color, some design, something that can catch your eye, he said. A line bracelet and a line necklace and a big ruby  weve seen those things.But if you see a woman wearing a striking coral brooch, its just  breathtaking."}
{"text": "In a small home, Faye Toogood reinvented the idea of Englishness with a palette of inky slates and moody blues, and a unique room spray redolent of leather and mud.In her wildest dreams, the interior designer Faye Toogood wouldnt be hired just to decorate a house but to conceive a complete universe, from the art on the walls to the teaspoons in the cupboards. Last year, she was given the opportunity to do just that for an American couple with a small place in Londons Mayfair neighborhood. It was like creating a living work of art, says Toogood, who reveled in the artistic freedom  and had nearly everything custom-made. The result is a Victorian flat that provides an unadulterated view of Toogoods theatrical aesthetic: a moody and stylized juxtaposition of Modernist and traditional furniture, country and urban references and a transporting use of color.Toogood, who began her career as a prop stylist at The World of Interiors before branching out on her own in 2008, wanted the flat to feel thoroughly English, but without leaning on familiar totems like club chairs and wood paneling. (Thats my nature, she says. If theres a path to the front door, Ill find the side road to the back.) After stripping the flat of its pseudo Victorian moldings, she drenched the walls in polished plaster tinted in bespoke shades of petrol blue and thunderstorm-gray to conjure the low natural light of London. Its almost like walking into a painting, she explains. Northern Europe is always so gray, theres no point in trying to brighten a space by painting it white. Toogood also chose to work exclusively with British materials and craftspeople for the project. A made-to-order wall hanging in the master bedroom  entitled Storm and woven in shades of sapphire  was created by the traditional West Dean tapestry studio in North Chichester, one of the few of its kind left in England. The alluring cave of a kitchen  from cabinet facings to countertops  is constructed entirely of inky slate found in Wales, and the master bath is covered in honey-colored floor-to-ceiling English silver stone. These more traditional touches, Toogood says, reflect her time at The World of Interiors, when it was helmed by its eccentric founder, Min Hogg. There was no sense of trend or fashion at the magazine, she says. It was about the wealth and history of an object or room, whether it was made yesterday or 500 years ago.Juxtaposing the flats romantic version of Englishness are contemporary pieces, such as colored LED rod lights and subversive custom furniture from of-the-moment London designers like Max Lamb and Martino Gamper, which give rooms the sense of disruption and tension that is ever-present in Toogoods work. (Along with residences, shes done provocative store installations for brands like Herms, Selfridges and Comme des Garons.) Toogood began designing furniture in 2010, and pieces from her own line are scattered about like rustic sculptures, including an iridescent green-and-blue jewelery stand and the cream-colored egglike fiberglass chairs she designed when she was pregnant with her daughter, Indigo, now 3.I envisioned the flat as less of a vacation home and more like the most personal and private of hotels, she said. True to her word, she commissioned bespoke cards from Mount Street Printers for the residence, hung robes from the line of unisex clothing she designs with her sister in the closets and, to complete the illusion of escape, created a custom room fragrance with a French perfumery that smells of old leather and mud. Im very greedy as a designer, she says with a laugh. I want to orchestrate a whole world."}
{"text": "England is the 2016 European Six Nations champion, but must win again in Paris next Saturday to take the biggest prize: the Grand Slam.Englands players won the title while watching their televisions on Sunday as they saw France, the last team with a chance to catch them, lose, 29-18, to Scotland in Edinburgh. It is its 27th championship, breaking its tie with Wales (26) at the top of the all-time standings.It was also Englands second trophy in 24 hours, since a 25-21 against Wales here at Twickenham on Saturday had completed the Triple Crown  victories over the other three British and Irish nations.Victory over France (2-2) would complete a perfect first season for Englands new coach, the Australian Eddie Jones. It would be both its first slam in 13 years, since its World Cup winning year of 2003, and its 13th of ever.France will go into the match on the back of consecutive losses. The loss on Sunday was its first defeat by Scotland in 10 years. It scored fine team tries at the beginning and end of the first half and showed spirit to fight back within 3 points after trailing by 18-5.But France was no match for the rapidly improving Scots (2-2) in the most entertaining match so far of a low-quality tournament. Fullback Stuart Hogg was Scotlands star, scoring its first try, landing a 55-meter penalty goal and creating its decisive third try for wing Tim Visser with a deft deflection of a long pass from scrum-half Greig Laidlaw. Scotland will go to Dublin to play Ireland next Saturday in third place, with hopes of only its fourth top-half finish since its last championship in 1999.If England does complete the slam to finish 5-0, it will most very likely look back at the 25-21 victory on Saturday over Wales as the moment where it all could have slipped away but didnt.England spent the first hour looking like a worthy champion, then nearly blew it. The match echoed the last time England played Wales at Twickenham, a 28-25 loss in late September during the World Cup. Englands loss of a match it had dominated played a huge role in why Jones replaced Stuart Lancaster after the cup.But in September, England was never ahead by more than 10 points. On Saturday, England led by 18 points with only six minutes to go, yet gave away 14 of them as the previously ineffective Welsh finally found their edge. Left winger George North and No. 8 Taulupe Faletau scored late tries for Wales, both converted by flyhalf Dan Biggar.England barely hung on to win at the end. North was taken down just a few yards short of a winning score by England center Manu Tuilagi, who came on as a replacement.Wales scored three tries to Englands one, but any result other than an England win would have been a travesty.Our first 60 minutes was superb, Jones said. We played very well, with a lot of precision, were tactically smart and were physical.During that hour, England dominated Wales in every aspect of play, with the rookie lock forward Maro Itoje playing brilliantly. Itoje, 21, certainly is smart  he is studying for a political science degree at London Universitys School of Oriental and African Studies. On Saturday, the 6-foot-5, 240-pound Itoje was a huge physical presence as well, dominating the lineout, making big tackles and setting up winger Anthony Watson to score Englands only try.Wales produced its worst Six Nations showing in at least five years and was hopelessly outgunned in its usual areas of strength, losing the hand-to-hand battle for possession and missing 19 tackles in the first half alone.We just didnt turn up in that first 40 minutes, said Wales coach, Warren Gatland, who acknowledged that he thought about benching some starters after only 25 minutes. At this level, that is just not acceptable.Wales trailed by 16-0 at halftime and, despite an opportunist try by Biggar, was still behind by 25-7  with England center Owen Farrell kicking 20 points  when England was reduced to 14 men for the final eight minutes with prop Dan Cole getting a yellow card for collapsing a maul.Jones blamed a change of attitude for Englands late collapse.In the last 20 minutes we tried to protect our lead rather than increase it, he said. If we had played with the same intent as in the first 60 minutes, we would have won by a lot more.Defeat eliminated Wales (2-1-1) from contention. It also lost its captain Sam Warburton with a head injury after 56 minutes, while Englands prop Joe Marler formally apologized on Sunday for calling Wales prop Sam Lee a gypsy boy.Earlier on Saturday, Ireland (1-1-2) hammered Italy, 58-15, in Dublin, ending any fear that last years champion would fall from first to last. Eight players shared Irelands nine tries, its most in a championship match, with No. 8 Jamie Heaslip crossing twice.The result doomed Italy (0-4) to its 10th last-place finish in 17 seasons  as many as Wales has recorded in 118 seasons."}
{"text": "JUPITER, Fla.   Ozhaino Albies can mark his birth in relation to the most famous baseball player his country ever produced, a man who inextricably linked their small island nation, Curaao, to the Atlanta Braves.I was born four and a half months after Andruw Jones made his debut, Albies, a top prospect for the Braves, said before a recent spring training game.It seems fitting that Albies entered the world  or Willemstad, to be precise  so shortly after the inception of Joness major league career in Atlanta.Few teams can match the success that the Braves have had in Curaao. It began in 1996 with Jones, who went on to play 12 years in Atlanta. The Braves subsequently added Randall Simon, Jair Jurrjens and the gifted shortstop Andrelton Simmons.Albies, who turned 19 on Jan. 7, could become the next in that chain. Compact, athletic and as smooth as any of the other terrific shortstops who learned to play on Curaaos gravelly youth fields, Albies, who goes by Ozzie, has impressed in his first major league training camp.Hes really, really good, said Jeff Francoeur, the veteran Braves outfielder. He could play in the big leagues right now. Im not saying he would be a star, but he would hold his own. He is fun to watch, and it seems like he gets it. I think he can be really special.Albies is listed at 5 feet 9 inches, but to some scouts he looks closer to the height of Jose Altuve, the Houston Astros 5-6 second baseman, whose 425 hits the last two years have demonstrated that height is not a prerequisite for baseball success.Albies can field his position well, and with eight hits in his first 24 at-bats in spring training, he has shown proficiency against some major league pitching, and gained confidence.I feel I am ready for this, he said. I know I have a lot to work on and a lot to learn. But I feel I am ready to do whatever is necessary to get there.Albies batted .328 with an .812 on-base plus slugging percentage in 155 minor league games over two seasons, mostly in Class A. He hit only one home run but had 28 doubles and 11 triples and has landed on many top-prospect lists.Hes faced every challenge weve given him, and were very excited to have him, Braves General Manager John Coppolella said. Hes a winning player and an exciting player.Coppolella credited the Curaaoan scout Dargello Lodowica for signing Albies, who learned to play baseball on the same field as Simmons (now with the Los Angeles Angels), Jurickson Profar of the Texas Rangers and the Yankees Didi Gregorius.Philip Elhage, a longtime scout and one of the deans of Curaao baseball, has been watching Albies since he was a boy.He was kind of overlooked because of his size, but he has a big heart, Elhage said. Hes a very polite kid, but he is a fighter. I think he can be the next guy.Players from Curaao often intrigue major league teams. They come from a tradition of good coaching and are usually well educated in the Dutch system. Many people from Curaao are fluent in Dutch, English, Spanish and Papiamento.Players from Curaao speak four different languages and grow up playing baseball, Coppolella said. They have the intellect as well as the instincts. Not to say the guys from other countries dont have that. But just speaking about Curaao, we have been very happy with the players we have brought to the Braves.Albies is not only a good baseball player; he says he plays a good deal of tennis, too. His girlfriend, Janet Evans, is a high-level tennis player from Curaao, and they often play together. (Albies says he uses a one-handed backhand; otherwise he would swing his racket like a bat and send the ball into the Caribbean.)The couple envision a day when Evans can come to the United States to train near Albies. The hope is for that to be in Atlanta in the not-too-distant future.For now, the Braves have Erick Aybar, whom they acquired from the Angels in the deal that included Simmons. He is expected to be the regular shortstop for the next year or two.But the future is quite intriguing, beyond Albies. In December, the Braves acquired Dansby Swanson from the Arizona Diamondbacks, who had picked him with the first overall pick in the 2015 amateur draft. Swanson is an exceptional shortstop, too.Perhaps one of them will eventually move to second base, and the Braves can envision a foundational double-play combo of Albies and Swanson for years to come.Its a good problem to have, Coppolella said. We are excited about the options we have in the future, and excited about the options we have right now.Before their recent spring game against the Miami Marlins, Albies and Swanson worked out together at shortstop, and when Aybar went onto the field, they moved in tandem to second base to gather more ground balls.I just want to help the Braves any way I can, Albies said. I know about the history with the Braves in Curaao going back to Andruw Jones, of course. I was a big fan, and then I was a fan of Andrelton, too. It would be great to follow their footsteps."}

{"text": "Donald J. Trump is holding a commanding lead in Florida and faces a tight race in Ohio, according to new polls released ahead of Tuesdays pivotal primary races.Surveys from Quinnipiac University show Mr. Trump more than doubling up Senator Marco Rubio of Florida in his home state. Of likely Republican voters, 46 percent support Mr. Trump and 22 percent back Mr. Rubio. Trailing them are Senator Ted Cruz, with 14 percent, and Gov. John Kasich, with 10 percent.Such an outcome could spell trouble for Mr. Rubio, who has vowed to win Florida and could face calls to leave the race if he fails to do so.Senator Marco Rubio, who has staked his future on wining his home state, looks like hell soon be toast, said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll.While Mr. Trump is the clear favorite in Florida, the race for Ohio is very much up for grabs. The Manhattan businessman is virtually tied with Mr. Kasich in his home state, with both holding support of 38 percent of likely Republican voters. Behind them in the Buckeye State are Mr. Cruz with 16 percent and Mr. Rubio with 3 percent.The states are two big prizes on a Primary Day that also includes elections in Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina. Candidates who are lagging in the polls are clinging to hopes that they are wrong, as they were in Michigans Democratic race last week.The Democratic races in Florida and Ohio look similar to those on the Republican side, with Hillary Clinton holding a big lead in Florida over Senator Bernie Sanders, while the race in Ohio remains close.In Florida, Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders by a margin of 60 percent to 34 percent. Women and more moderate voters strongly support the former secretary of state, while men and very liberal voters are heavily behind the Vermont senator.Ohio remains Mr. Sanderss best hope for an upset and an opportunity to keep the race for the Democratic nomination competitive. Of likely Democratic voters, 51 percent support Mrs. Clinton and 46 percent are pulling for Mr. Sanders.Sanders has the momentum, but the question is whether he can win as he did in Michigan or just come close as in Iowa, Mr. Brown said.The polls have margins of error of plus or minus four percentage points."}

{"text": "Establishment Republicans who are horrified by the rise of Donald Trump might want to take a minute to remember the glitch heard round the world  the talking point Marco Rubio couldnt stop repeating in a crucial debate, exposing him to devastating ridicule and sending his campaign into a death spiral.It went like this: Lets dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesnt know what hes doing. He knows exactly what hes doing. The clear, if ungrammatical, implication was that all the bad things Republicans claim have happened under President Obama  in particular, Americas allegedly reduced stature in the world  are the result of a deliberate effort to weaken the nation.In other words, the establishment favorite for the G.O.P. nomination, the man Time magazine once put on its cover with the headline The Republican Savior, was deliberately channeling the paranoid style in American politics. He was suggesting, albeit coyly, that a sitting president is a traitor.And now the establishment is shocked to see a candidate who basically plays the same game, but without the coyness, the overwhelming front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination. Why?The truth is that the road to Trumpism began long ago, when movement conservatives  ideological warriors of the right  took over the G.O.P. And it really was a complete takeover. Nobody seeking a career within the party dares to question any aspect of the dominating ideology, for fear of facing not just primary challenges but excommunication.You can see the continuing power of the orthodoxy in the way all of the surviving contenders for the Republican nomination, Mr. Trump included, have dutifully proposed huge tax cuts for the wealthy, even though a large majority of voters, including many Republicans, want to see taxes on the rich increased instead.But how does a party in thrall to a basically unpopular ideology  or at any rate an ideology voters would dislike if they knew more about it  win elections? Obfuscation helps. But demagogy and appeals to tribalism help more. Racial dog whistles and suggestions that Democrats are un-American if not active traitors arent things that happen now and then, theyre an integral part of Republican political strategy.During the Obama years Republican leaders cranked the volume on that strategy up to 11 (although it was pretty bad during the Clinton years too.) Establishment Republicans generally avoided saying in so many words that the president was a Kenyan Islamic atheist socialist friend of terrorists  although as the quote from Mr. Rubio shows, they came pretty close  but they tacitly encouraged those who did, and accepted their endorsements. And now theyre paying the price.For the underlying assumption behind the establishment strategy was that voters could be fooled again and again: persuaded to vote Republican out of rage against Those People, then ignored after the election while the party pursued its true, plutocrat-friendly priorities. Now comes Mr. Trump, turning the dog whistles into fully audible shouting, and telling the base that it can have the bait without the switch. And the establishment is being destroyed by the monster it created.Things are very different on the other side of the aisle.I still sometimes see people suggesting an equivalence between Mr. Trump and Bernie Sanders. But while both men are challenging a party establishment, those establishments arent the same. The Democratic Party is, as some political scientists put it, a coalition of social groups, ranging from Planned Parenthood to teachers unions, rather than an ideological monolith; theres nothing comparable to the array of institutions that enforces purity on the other side.Indeed, what the Sanders movement, with its demands for purity and contempt for compromise and half-measures, most nearly resembles is not the Trump insurgency but the ideologues who took over the G.O.P., becoming the establishment Mr. Trump is challenging. And yes, were starting to see hints from that movement of the ugliness that has long been standard operating procedure on the right: bitter personal attacks on anyone who questions the campaigns premises, an increasing amount of demagogy from the campaign itself. Compare the Sanders and Clinton Twitter feeds to see what I mean.But back to the Republicans: Lets dispel with this fiction that the Trump phenomenon represents some kind of unpredictable intrusion into the normal course of Republican politics. On the contrary, the G.O.P. has spent decades encouraging and exploiting the very rage that is now carrying Mr. Trump to the nomination. That rage was bound to spin out of the establishments control sooner or later.Donald Trump is not an accident. His party had it coming."}
{"text": "My column about the ambiguities of trade was, I can report, a surprise to at least some readers, aka my neighbors  well-informed people who told me, I thought the story was that trade always raises all boats. But Brad DeLong has a thoughtful response, arguing that the really big benefits of globalization come from technology diffusion, which make it a much more positive force than I suggest.I used to believe the same thing, and still find myself thinking along those lines now and then. But Id argue that economists need to be, at the least, upfront about the arguments limitations.First, it doesnt come out of the models. As Brad says, the map is not the territory; but guesses about such things are, well, guesses. There was a time when everyone knew that import-substituting industrialization was the key to economic takeoff, based on loose historical reasoning (America and Germany did it!). Then developing countries tried it en masse, and the results werent great.Furthermore, my sense is that nonstandard free-trade arguments tend to involve, often unintentionally, a kind of bait and switch. Economists love to talk about comparative advantage, which is a beautiful piece of reasoning that runs counter to lay intuition. Somewhere Alan Blinder said that economists would almost all agree on the slogan Yay free trade. But the seeming authority of the comparative-advantage case then ends up being carried over, illegitimately, to arguments for trade that have nothing to do with comparative advantage. Yes, there could be positive externalities associated with trade, but there could be positive externalities associated with lots of things, and Ricardian models dont give us any special reason to think that the trade ones are more important.So how would you test such arguments? Well, in a way we did carry out an experiment. In the early 1990s there was a widespread orthodoxy that outward-looking development policies were much more favorable to growth than inward-looking policies. This orthodoxy had a lot to do with the rapid growth of Asian economies, which had followed an export-oriented path rather than the import substitution tried by much of the world in the 50s and 60s. The question, however, was whether you would see dramatic acceleration of growth in other places, such as Latin America, when policy shifted away from inward focus.And the answer turned out to be, not so much. Look at Mexico, which did a radical trade liberalization in 1985-88, then joined NAFTA. It has seen a transformation of its economy in many ways; it has gone from an economy that didnt export much besides oil and tourism to a major manufacturing export power. And the effect on development has been  undewhelming.So Brad could be right; but the evidence is far from conclusive. I would still argue very strongly that its crucial to keep markets open for poor countries. But we should be cautious in our claims about the virtues of free trade."}

{"text": "When Denzel Valentine arrived at Michigan State, few predicted that he would be the programs next great star. Valentine, while talented, was not a highly heralded recruit; some services did not even rate him among the 100 best players in his high school class.Four years later, Valentine is one of the best players in the country, a Swiss Army knife of a star who has made the Spartans, a No. 2 seed, a contender to reach the Final Four.A native of Lansing, Mich., Valentine is a product of his pedigree and his work ethic. A coachs son who won two state championships playing for his father at Sexton High a few miles across town, he helped take Michigan State to the Final Four as a junior last March. This season, he has been even better.Valentine leads the Spartans in scoring with 19.4 points per game and is second on the team in rebounding, at 7.6 per game. He also ranks fourth in Division I in assists, with 7.6 per game.At 6 feet 5 inches and 220 pounds, he is big enough to hold his own in the lane, yet nimble enough to lead fast breaks in the open floor. While Ben Simmons, Louisiana States wunderkind freshman, has turned heads with his box-score-stuffing stat lines, Valentine has matched him while also leading Michigan State into the Top 5.I do think hes the best player in the country, Spartans Coach Tom Izzo said.Izzo has paid Valentine the highest of compliments at Michigan State, comparing him to Spartans royalty like Magic Johnson and Draymond Green. But Izzo never asked Green, his previous do-it-all star, to take on the role of point guard midway through the schedule, as he did with Valentine this season.Valentines performance since then has been so impressive that Izzo says he is now a more well-rounded player than Green, an N.B.A. All-Star, ever was in college.When asked two weeks ago if he shared that opinion, Valentine indicated that it was an unanswerable question. Instead, he pointed to a priority that he said was more important than any position, award or statistic.Winning, he said, is the thing.Despite winning the Big Ten tournament title moments before the bracket announcement, Michigan State was bumped down to a No. 2 seed below Virginia, the Atlantic Coast Conference tournaments runner-up. Both are worthy selections, but the Spartans are always dangerous in March. Since a sloppy stretch in January, Michigan State has gone 13-1.Syracuse, Temple, Tulsa, Vanderbilt and Wichita State sneaked into the field at the expense of hopefuls like Monmouth, St. Bonaventure, St. Marys and Valparaiso. Its a sad day for midmajors, Valparaiso Coach Bryce Drew said. Syracuse nearly blew its N.C.A.A. chances by going 4-5 while Jim Boeheim served a suspension at midseason but redeemed itself in a conference that produced two No. 1 seeds.Fresno State over Utah will be a popular pick, but Arkansas-Little Rock over Purdue is safer.

{"text": "Terrorism may involve dramatic, unspeakable acts, but its logistics can be positively banal. In High Dive, the vibrantly cinematic new novel by Jonathan Lee, a 24-year-old Irish Republican Army volunteer named Dan checks in under a pseudonym at the Grand Hotel in Brighton, England, with the express intention of helping a colleague plant a bomb to kill Margaret Thatcher.The receptionist, Freya, who readers will grow to love and root for  shes waffling over going to college, flummoxed by boys  treats Dan with a desk clerks customary solicitousness, even a mild longing. Dan responds with indifferent efficiency. No, he does not need to see the room. Thanks, but hell pay for all three nights up front in cash. Ah, the room has a sea view, lovely, but does it have a desk?Then he thaws a bit. Something like banter begins. Freya mentions that Prime Minister Thatcher will be coming to visit, and Dan fires up the charm, asking which room might be on reserve for so distinguished a guest. Freya declines to say.He nodded, Mr. Lee writes. His eyes politely died.Yet heres the twist  and an example of the sort of phyllo-dough layering that makes High Dive so rich: We soon learn that this exchange, which leaves Freya bewildered and disappointed, has the same effect on Dan. He wasnt prepared, Mr. Lee writes, for the way that, looking at her skin unspoiled by make-up or injury, hed sense within that receptionist girl not arrogance, not ignorance, not the hoped-for signs that she liked to serve the ruling elite.She is, instead, suffering, just as he is  from disappointment, abandonment, a sense of reduced economic horizons. And so is Freyas father, Moose, the deputy general manager of the hotel.Anyone who was alive in 1984 and reading the newspaper  or has made a cursory study of British history since  will recognize the broad outlines of High Dive. In September 1984, a member of the I.R.A. named Patrick J. Magee planted a long-delay time bomb in the bathroom of Room 629 of the Grand Hotel in Brighton, where Thatcher and her cabinet were set to convene for their annual Conservative Party conference. It detonated over three weeks later on Oct. 12, killing five and injuring 30. Thatcher was awake and at work in her suite, but she was not injured.There has always been a low hum of speculation that Mr. Magee had an accomplice. In High Dive, Mr. Lee, a British novelist now living in Brooklyn (hes a senior editor at Catapult), has taken the liberty of scribbling him in.It was an inspired idea. Rather than slavishly recreating the Brighton bombing in its every detail, Mr. Lee freestyles, creating a sympathetic ensemble both at the Grand Hotel and in the streets of Belfast  the book tacks back and forth between the two  all while making expert use of the dramatic tension inherent in waiting for a lethal explosion. His book reminds one of Alfred Hitchcocks distinction between surprise and suspense: Surprise is when the audience has no clue that theres a bomb beneath the table and it suddenly goes off; suspense, Hitchcock explained, is when the public knows it, probably because they have seen the anarchist place it there.We saw Dan put it there.Its suspense that pulls us in. We make so many complex emotional investments in the lives of Mr. Lees characters, including Dan, that it takes a monks restraint not to flip to the very end of the book before you get there. (I managed. Sort of.)Though High Dive is, on its surface, about an attempted assassination, what its really about is working-class disappointment  from immobility, political neglect and scattered daily humiliations.Dan, an introverted, enterprising handyman in Belfast, watched the Royal Ulster Constabulary whack his mother so hard she lost one of the only real teeth from her mouth; his father they murdered with a stomp to the stomach and a brick to the head. On Dans 24th birthday, British soldiers raided the pub where he was celebrating and forced him to do a jig. He didnt even know a jig.In Brighton, Moose, once a star athlete, is now cuckolded, living alone with his daughter, and stuck, stuck, stuck. As deputy general manager at a hotel, his whole life is about subservience and pleasing others, tolerating with forbearance pleas for different color sheets and even a request to reduce the ocean noise. He wishes hed gone to college. Might be a guy at the head of something now.Shortly after executing a lovely high dive from a 10-meter board at the public pool  briefly recapturing the sense of possibility he had in his youth  he has a heart attack at age 45. It does not kill him. But it does little for his undernourished morale.And yet the novel is at times quite droll. When Moose gets a visit from his mother, a drawer of tiny knives, he steels himself: In her old age she was a great dispenser of tips and wisdom, around 5 percent of it excellent.Theres great range and compassion and high-definition imagery in Mr. Lees writing. One of the I.R.A. grunts has a lavishly ugly cauliflower ear; another, a face like a dose of hemorrhoids. (And thats in the first four pages.) He does flirtation very well. And the spiteful chatter of marital deterioration.Mr. Lee has also clearly studied the hospitality industry, and the details he offers about hotel back-office culture are great fun. (On the list of Top Five Lies Today compiled at the Grand Hotel registration desk: Madam, Im so sorry. If there was any way to upgrade you, I would.)He has studied the details of the Brighton bombing, too, though I will not say how it plays out for his characters. I will only say that the few pages preceding it are, to me, almost as devastating as the devastation itself. Moose never gets to speak to Margaret Thatcher, despite his many fantasies about doing so.He spots his moment. He tries. Then a Special Branch guy barged him into the shadows. She was gone."}

{"text": "BEIJING  The Chinese characters for pure and true, signifying halal, hang over numerous restaurants across China, a symbol of a commitment to prepare food in accordance with Islamic law, including its ban on pork and alcohol.But some of Chinas more than 23 million Muslims worry that businesses routinely flout those guidelines, selling sweets laced with lard, for instance, or pork disguised as beef.As political leaders gathered in Beijing for the annual session of the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference, a government advisory body, officials once again raised the idea of imposing national standards on halal food, which have been under consideration since 2002.Ma Guoquan, a delegate from Ningxia, a region in northwest China that is home to a large Muslim population, said it was important to respect the traditions of ethnic minorities and to promote the unity of Chinese society.There are many problems regarding halal food management that cant be ignored, Mr. Ma said at a meeting in Beijing last week, according to a report in Ningxia Daily, a state-run newspaper.Many local governments in China, including Ningxia and Shanghai, have put in place rules on preparing halal food. Islamic law bans the consumption of pork and alcohol, and it dictates how animals should be slaughtered before they are eaten. But enforcement of those regulations has been lax in some provinces, angering local residents.In Xian, an ancient capital in central China, Muslim residents took to the streets last year to protest the sale of alcohol in halal restaurants. In Xining, a city in the western province of Qinghai, a riot erupted last year after residents discovered pork products inside a halal bakerys delivery van.As the market for halal products booms around the world  some analysts expect it to reach $1.6 trillion in the next several years  Chinese businesses are looking for ways to enter the market. President Xi Jinping has sought new alliances with many predominantly Muslim countries, proposing a One Belt One Road initiative to restore Silk Road trade routes.But halal business owners in China face several obstacles to selling their products abroad, including the perception that food in China is unsafe or not prepared in accordance with Islamic law.Islamic leaders said a set of national standards could help promote Chinas image abroad.Food safety has always been a serious problem in China, Mu Kefa, vice chairman of the Islamic Association of China, which promotes the ethnic and religious policies of the ruling Communist Party, said in a telephone interview on Thursday. With national regulations, the government can more effectively manage the halal food industry and show respect to ethnic minorities in China."}
{"text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.  John Hayes, cleareyed and wild-haired, stood before his silent creation. Big as a slim refrigerator, it held 16 petabytes of data, roughly equal to 16 billion thick books.People are going to have to think about things to put into this, he said, surrounded by the clutter of his office at a Silicon Valley company called Pure Storage. But that wont take long  theres a demand for data that nobody was ready for.Each month, the worlds one billion cellphones throw out 18 exabytes of data, equal to 1,100 of Mr. Hayess boxes. There are also millions of sensors in things ranging from cars and appliances to personal fitness trackers and cameras.IBM estimates that by 2020 we will have 44 zettabytes  the thousandfold number next up from exabytes  generated by all those devices. It is so much information that Big Blue is staking its future on so-called machine learning and artificial intelligence, two kinds of pattern-finding software built to cope with all that information.Making storage products has long been a major part of the tech industry. It has also been one of the dullest, with little in the way of innovation. Now the surge in data is leading both start-ups and some of techs biggest companies to rethink how they approach the problem.Pure, co-founded by Mr. Hayes, a 38-year-old former video karaoke engineer, is one of several companies trying new approaches.Mr. Hayess box, which was unveiled on Monday, holds five times as much data as a conventional storage device, thanks to a combination of so-called flash storage technology and clever engineering. Sometime in 2017, he said, it will hold twice that much, as Pure tweaks the product. Power consumption, the company says, is 4 percent of the current standard.While traditional storage works much like a record player, with data stored on and fetched from spinning disks, flash storage gets data directly on and off a semiconductor. Flash storage has become common in consumer tech products like smartphones.The new Pure system is also built in blades, which act like building blocks. Add a blade, and the overall system reconfigures to raise efficiency. There is space on the device for additional processing, so a blade could easily be added.Its not just about Google and Facebook, said Joe Unsworth, an analyst with Gartner. Health care, manufacturing and natural resources companies can all justify owning this much storage. In 10 years, a big sanitation company with sensors on its Dumpsters to manage pickups could have tens of petabytes.Pure is hardly alone in working on new ways to handle the worlds immense data deluge. The industry leader, EMC, has both traditional and advanced storage, including flash. EMC was bought by Dell in October for $67 billion. If Dell hadnt bought them, Id wonder what Dell was going to do, Mr. Unsworth said.Netflix, which offers streaming video to 75 million people in 190 countries, ships dozens of custom-built appliances a week to hundreds of local Internet service providers. The newest, a mix of flash and traditional storage, can store five petabytes  enough, the company figures, to hold almost anything from its catalog that anyone, anywhere would want to watch, for now.The company analyzes data to figure out both the kind of content it should offer next, and the Internets capacity to stream all that entertainment. We arguably have the most insight of anybody, said Ken Florance, vice president of content delivery at Netflix. There are networks in Kenya that are better than some networks in the U.S.Capturing and analyzing masses of data already touches improbable corners, like championship auto racing. Mercedes AMG Petronas, the racing arm of the Daimler car company, is an early customer of the new Pure blades.Mercedes AMG has about 300 sensors on each high-performance car. Much the way human athletes are regulated for substances, racing officials now limit the amount of computation cars can use, including wind tunnel simulations between races, so it pays to move data quickly.They audit the amount of processing we use, said Matt Harris, the head of information technology for Mercedes AMG. If we can cut a few seconds off each job with faster storage, thats an extra simulation a month.Pure is in a race of its own. The company went public in October, and since then its stock has fallen one-third from the highs reached soon after. The new flash blade product line will not be important for revenue this year, but the companys chief executive, Scott Dietzen, hopes it will calm disappointed investors.No one can look at all their data anymore; they need algorithms just to decide what to look at, he said, adding that he planned to offer 10 times the performance of competing products, at a lower cost. This market is at least as large as our original storage business, and a lot bigger over time.Mr. Hayes didnt set out to shake up a once-staid storage world. In 2006, he was a software engineer at a company that did online karaoke talent searches, when it was purchased by Yahoo.When Yahoo killed the product, he became a promoter of Yahoos social networks, then quit in 2009. His old bosses at the karaoke company, backed by venture capitalists, were looking at a way to use flash and needed a good coder.The first Pure Storage product came out in 2012.By mid-2013, he was thinking about how he would build his product for a world of falling memory prices, and rapidly rising amounts of data inside cloud computing systems.Working with Mr. Dietzen and investors, he set up a venture inside Pure but away from the rest of the company, hiring a team of experienced people from places like Oracle, Microsoft Research and Facebook. Mr. Dietzen hopes investors will now see where some formerly unexplained research and development money has gone.He got people you couldnt recruit if you were a start-up  midcareer  who wouldnt work at a place that was going to run out of money, but wanted to be in something small and challenging, said Par Botes, an early hire who was chief technology officer at EMC. Like others in the effort, Mr. Botes has a LinkedIn profile that says only that he is at a stealth mode start-up technology company.From an original group of five people, the quiet project inside Pure has grown to 80, and Mr. Hayes sees a need for many more.Ive talked to companies planning for hundreds of petabytes, he said. Even a body camera on a cop adds up data pretty quickly."}
{"text": "Their websites show peaceful scenes  young women relaxing by the ocean or caring for horses in emerald pastures  and boast of their chefs and other amenities.One center sends out invitations to a reception with cocktails and hors doeuvres. Another offers doctors and therapists all-expense-paid trips to visit and experience their offerings, including yoga classes. Several employ staff who call mental health professionals, saying they would love to have lunch.The marketing efforts by these for-profit residential care centers are aimed at patients with eating disorders and the clinicians who treat them. The programs have proliferated in recent years, with some companies expanding across the country.The rapid growth of the industry  there are more than 75 centers, compared with 22 a decade ago, according to one count  has been propelled by the Affordable Care Act and other changes in health insurance laws that have increased coverage for mental disorders, as well as by investments from private equity firms.The residential programs, their directors say, fill a dire need, serving patients from areas where no adequate treatment is available. Only 15 to 30 percent of people have access to specialized care for eating disorders, which means there are a lot of people out there who have zippo, said Doug Bunnell, the chief clinical officer for Monte Nido, a program that began in Malibu, Calif., and now operates centers in five states.But the advertising and the profusion of centers, which typically cost $1,000 a day but can run much higher, is raising concerns among some eating disorders experts, who worry that some programs may be taking advantage of vulnerable patients and their families.In the companies rush to expand, they argue, quality of treatment may be sacrificed for profit. And they question whether the spalike atmosphere of some programs is so comfortable that it fosters dependency.For the most part, the people who are running and working in these programs believe theyre doing the right thing, said Dr. Angela Guarda, the director of the eating disorders program at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.But its a slippery slope, she said. Money can cloud your view.Many eating disorders specialists agree that some patients require the supervision of residential programs and benefit from the treatment. But studies showing the programs effectiveness are scant, Dr. Guarda and other experts said. The methods of the handful of studies that exist have been criticized.The quality and form of treatment varies widely across centers, and in some cases includes approaches  equine therapy, for example, or faith-based treatment  with little or no scientific evidence behind them. Some programs have full-time psychiatrists and medical doctors on staff, but others lack the expertise to handle emergencies or treat patients with coexisting medical or psychiatric problems.The perks offered to outside clinicians who might refer patients, the experts say, include free trips, restaurant meals, educational seminars and small gifts like pens and key chains dispensed at professional meetings. Critics liken them to pharmaceutical industry tactics that led to laws and policies requiring financial disclosure, though on a smaller scale. Studies had shown that even small gifts from drug companies, like free medication samples, affected doctors prescription practices.In an article to be published Monday in the journal Psychiatric Services, Dr. Evelyn Attia, a professor of psychiatry and director of the eating disorders program at Columbia University Medical Center, and four colleagues called for more transparency about the financial relationships between residential centers and the professionals who send them patients, and urged clinicians to be mindful of efforts to influence their recommended treatment.The effect of these clinician inducements, which are aimed at building a programs patient referral base, may not be fully recognized by the professionals they target, wrote Dr. Attia and her colleagues, who included Dr. Guarda.Several industry representatives said that while they had not seen the journal article, they agreed that more data on patient outcomes and stricter standards were needed. But, they said, the trips and seminars offered to clinicians were primarily educational. I dont think anyone in the eating disorders world is giving out swimming pools and trips to Europe and things like that, Dr. Bunnell said.Jillian Lampert, president of the Residential Eating Disorders Consortium, a group that represents about 85 percent of the centers, said, Health cares always been a business, adding that quality and profit were not mutually exclusive. If there are concerns, she said, we are incredibly open to having those conversations.Eating disorders are among the most difficult mental illnesses to treat.Anorexia, in particular, has stymied many of psychiatrys best treatment efforts. The illness has the highest mortality rate of any mental disorder, with patients dying from the medical complications of starvation or from suicide. And patients often resist treatments that make them feel uncomfortable.The most severely ill patients  the prognosis is grimmer the longer someone has anorexia, studies suggest  require hospital treatment just to stay alive. But even after being stabilized, many patients need continual supervision for a time to regain weight and learn new behavior. The length of stay in residential centers ranges from two weeks to a year. A 2006 study found that the average stay was 83 days.In the past, health insurance companies placed strict limits on coverage for eating disorders, treating them differently from other medical illnesses. Few insurers were willing to pay for 24-hour care after a patient was out of immediate danger.But the passage of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act in 2008 and the Affordable Care Act two years later mandated equal treatment. Lawsuits brought by the families of patients who were denied coverage added to the pressure on insurers. In 2012, a federal appeals court ruled that health plans must cover residential treatment for anorexia under Californias parity law. The higher reimbursement rates offered some relief to families, who had often mortgaged their houses or drained their savings to pay for critically needed care.They also attracted the attention of Wall Street investors, who saw profits in providing treatment for so-called behavioral health problems like eating disorders, alcoholism and drug abuse. The number of covered lives is growing faster than the availability of services to treat them, creating compelling investment opportunities, the accounting and consulting firm BDO noted last year in an article on its website, referring to the effects of the legal changes.As the industry has expanded, larger centers have acquired smaller ones and some programs, flush with private equity investments, have expanded across the country.For example, Monte Nido, a treatment program founded by Carolyn Costin, a former teacher who recovered from an eating disorder, began with a center in Malibu.But in 2012, with financing from Centre Partners, a middle-market equity firm, Monte Nido began opening new residential centers and day-treatment programs. The company now has centers in Oregon, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New York, including one in a renovated mansion in Westchester County.Last year, noting that the investment had tripled the companys facility footprint during our ownership period, Centre Partners sold Monte Nido to another investment firm, Levine Leichtman Capital Partners, for an undisclosed sum.I believe that the Monte Nidos [sic] approach to eating disorder treatment is what you and others like you have been waiting for, Ms. Costin wrote in a letter to potential patients on the companys website, which includes images of beaches, mountains and the Boston skyline on its home page.With a need to fill more beds, marketers for some centers make cold calls to psychiatrists, psychotherapists, medical doctors and others who treat eating disorders, offering to inform them about a programs advantages and inviting them to visit.The Denver-based Eating Recovery Center has a call center and employs 20 professional relations liaisons who contact clinicians across the country. The author and motivational speaker Jenni Schaefer, who recovered from an eating disorder, recently joined the programs outreach team. On its website, the company, which began with a single center, bills itself as the only national health care system devoted to serious eating disorders at all levels of care.Craig Johnson, a well-known eating disorders specialist, joined the company in 2010 and has seen it through its expansion to 24 treatment programs in seven states, including three residential centers. He said when therapists visit, the focus is education, not entertainment. Were delivering lectures, Dr. Johnson said.Some therapists see the offer of free trips as a chance to view the facilities that they might recommend to patients.Ann Jacob Smith, a family therapist in Chevy Chase, Md., said that last year, she accepted an invitation to visit the Oliver-Pyatt eating disorders center in Miami. (The center is now part of Monte Nido).It was absolutely promotional, she said, But it was actually really educational. They took us in depth into what they did.Her later referrals were not influenced by the visit, she added. Im not impressed by being romanced.But Adrian Brown, a psychiatrist in Virginia, said that therapists who had not gone through the battle phase with drug companies might not even realize they were being swayed by financial interests.Dr. Brown recalled being offered a V.I.P. trip to a treatment center, with the representative telling her, We will pay your way, put you up in a really nice hotel, all expenses paid, yoga and whatever.Dr. Brown responded, No, thats not ethical.The representative replied, What do you mean? Another invitation arrived the next year.Prospective patients or family members searching for a treatment program sometimes turn to sites like edtreatmentreview.com or www.edtxreviews.com, where former patients describe their experiences at different centers, evaluating the staff, critiquing the food and noting whether cellphones are allowed.Many reviewers have spent time in more than one residential center and the opinions on any particular program vary widely, a range reflected in interviews with former patients over the last several months.Tina Klaus, a 51-year-old artist who has struggled with bulimia since she was 10, said residential care was initially useful.Residential treatment is vital when you are at your ultimate rock bottom she said. But once home, her illness worsened because youre going back into your life, youre going back into all the emotions you used your eating disorder to hide from.Melissa R., 28, who asked that her last name not be used for reasons of privacy, said after several hospitalizations for anorexia, beginning when she was 21, she found a residential center in the Southwest on the Internet and spent six weeks there. The center, which she described as more like a resort, was somewhat helpful, she said, but not worth the time and money.People were nice, and the food was really good, she said. I had fun, I enjoyed rock climbing and stuff, but thats not why I was there. Im paying a lot of money to get well, not to rock climb.Last year, she spent two months at Eating Recovery Center in Denver, moving from residential care to day treatment, and began to gain control of her illness. E.R.C. was the best place Ive been, she said about the center. They were very individualized.Ashley Bilkie, 29, had a different experience with E.R.C. When she returned home in February 2015 after about six months in the Denver program  her fourth stay in an inpatient program for treatment of anorexia and her second at E.R.C.  I was getting sicker and sicker, she said. She lost the weight she had gained back at the center. I had to buy childrens clothing, she said.She was evasive with her parents. At the recovery center, she said, It was kind of like they set up a battle between myself and my parents. For their part, Ms. Bilkies parents, who for years had watched their daughters health decline, grew frantic. Ms. Bilkie would disappear, her father, Robert Bilkie, said, and he would find her wandering the aisles at Kroger or Target. Driving through the neighborhood, he half-expected to see her hanging from a tree.Its a parents worst nightmare, he said.It was also expensive. Mr. Bilkie, a financial adviser in Michigan, calculated that over three years, he paid at least $350,000 for unreimbursed inpatient care for his daughter. The Eating Recovery Center, he said, sent him bills for $30,000 each month. Mr. Bilkie paid willingly  he was desperate to see Ashley get well, he said  but no program seemed to produce lasting results.We spent an outrageous amount of money for what really amounted to ineffectual treatment, Mr. Bilkie said.Last fall, Ms. Bilkie entered the eating disorder center at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center, a university affiliated program.The staff there gradually weaned her off some drugs she had been taking taking at the center in Denver, including high doses of Xanax, a tranquilizer, and Adderall, an attention deficit drug and a stimulant.In group therapy, other patients put pressure on her to change her behavior. It was a switch, she said, from previous groups, where patients talked about their problems. With the programs stress on weight restoration  studies show that it is the best predictor of how anorexic patients will do once they leave, rather than, say, elevated mood  her weight returned to normal.She was discharged in November and continues to do well.I hated every single solitary second of it, she said of the experience. But thats a good thing, because I was not comfortable, and it meant that something was working.Dr. Ovidio Bermudez, the chief clinical officer of Eating Recovery Center, said that other patients have fared poorly at academic centers and then done well at E.R.C. Despite Ms. Bilkies perception, he said, therapists at the program did not try to divide patients from their families. (Ms. Bilkie gave Eating Recovery Center permission to discuss her case.)We would have to filter this through 20/20 hindsight, Dr. Bermudez said. Its really hard to know what somebodys frame of mind is and the degree of fragility they bring to any treatment experience.Dr. Anne Marie OMelia, a psychiatrist at the recovery center, said Ms. Bilkie was on Xanax when she arrived and was fearful of reducing the drugs dosage, though the center tried. She was switched to Adderall from another stimulant at E.R.C., Dr. OMelia said, to treat significant impulsivity.Ms. Bilkies history of ups and downs is not unusual for patients with eating disorders.In many cases, you see one step forward, two steps back, said Dr. Mark Friedlander, the chief medical officer for Aetna Behavioral Health.His company, Dr. Friedlander said, considers residential care essential for treatment of some patients. But, he said, a lack of outcome studies, an absence of industry standards and a patchwork licensing system across states make it difficult for Aetna or other insurers to evaluate care.We would love to see greater consistency and higher standards, he said.To that end, a group of eating disorder specialists from treatment centers, including Eating Recovery Center and Monte Nido, have developed a list of minimum requirements for accreditation of residential programs. The Joint Commission, an independent company that accredits health care facilities, has adopted the requirements, which go into effect July 1.Dr. Lampert, president of the consortium, said the centers in the organization were also collecting data on patient outcomes, lengths of stay and other variables, with each center collecting data on 15 consecutive admissions of adults and adolescents.In the meantime, many patients and families will continue to rely on word of mouth and any information they can find online.These are black boxes, Dr. Scott Hadland, an adolescent medicine specialist at Harvard Medical School, said of the residential centers. People get the idea that these are places that can heal just based on what they see on a website or in the photos."}
{"text": "Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion come together at The New York Times. In this piece, Choe Sang-Hun, The Timess Seoul bureau chief, describes how he covered a Go match between the Go master Lee Se-dol and Googles AlphaGo.Lee Se-dol, a boyish-looking 33-year-old and a South Korean Go master, was preparing on Wednesday for his first match in a best-of-five series. His challenger, though, was nowhere to be seen.Thats because his challenger was a computer program.For days, Ive listened to people in Seoul talk about the match of the century  a round of Go between Mr. Lee and AlphaGo, a computer program created by Googles DeepMind artificial intelligence unit. Few news events here have attracted such a large and electrified crowd of reporters and TV cameras. Not even the briefings on North Koreas recent nuclear test generated such media frenzy.And as The Timess Seoul bureau chief, I was in the thick of it.The scene last Wednesday at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Seoul resembled a fight night on the Las Vegas Strip: hundreds of reporters, match organizers in black T-shirts (with earphones and walkie-talkies on their hip belts), bodyguards in suits and ties holding back milling photographers and TV crews.When the first game got underway, professional Go players  like newscasters describing a boxing match, punch by punch  served as commentators, offering an analysis of each move. But Go is so complex that its moves can be understood only by those trained in the game.Many reporters, and a majority of South Koreans, could not make heads or tails of the commentators analysis. We waited for the commentators to announce who had made a mistake and for remarks about how the players were doing in general.Called baduk in Korean, Go is a two-person board game popular in Northeast Asia. The players compete for more territory by placing black and white stones on intersections on a board of 19 lines by 19 lines. The number of possible moves in a Go game is said to be bigger than that of atoms of the observable universe.A typical Go match lasts several hours. In fast-paced and modern South Korea, Go is sometimes seen as a game from the past, an idle pastime enjoyed by older villagers in the summertime shade of a large tree. But in a country where computer games are all the rage among young people, Go still commands an enduring hold.Online Go match sites have taken the tradition to the Internet. Theres also a cable channel that shows Go matches round-the-clock. One recent box-office hit even featured gangsters who kidnap child Go geniuses and use earphones and other secret devices to fix Go matches with huge amounts of cash at stake.In the movie, those caught red-handed ended up having their fingers chopped off.No such blood in the Lee-AlphaGo matches  though thats not to say they lacked drama.In the first match, Mr. Lee conceded after three and a half hours. It was obvious  to him, anyway  that hed lost too much territory to recover. (Go watchers compare such concessions to combatants laying down their weapons; they call it throwing down the stone.)In the second match, on Thursday, Mr. Lee again threw down his stone.I must say I am speechless, he said. From the very beginning of the match, I could never manage an upper hand for one single move. It was AlphaGos total victory.Mr. Lees dramatic defeats were front-page news in South Korean newspapers and sparked public interest in  and even some fear of  artificial intelligence. Government officials noted that it was not AlphaGo, but the human programmers, who won the matches.On Saturday, Mr. Lee lost his third straight match  and the $1 million prize money. He admitted to feeling handicapped by the psychological pressure of facing an invisible foe. But he also said that AlphaGo was not perfect and that the machine showed weaknesses in some of its moves.Mr. Lee exploited those weaknesses in a surprising victory in the fourth match on Sunday. But AlphaGo won the fifth and final match on Tuesday, ending the series 4-1.One Twitter user quipped that he knew one sure way for a human to beat AlphaGo. Just pull out its electric plug, he wrote."}
{"text": "An activist shareholder in the Ambac Financial Group kicked off a board fight at the insurance firm on Monday, nominating three candidates for the companys board.The investor, Canyon Capital Advisors, began its proxy fight after Ambac elevated its interim chief executive, Nader Tavakoli, to its permanent chief.Canyon, which says that it owns nearly 5 percent of the companys shares, argued that Ambac had suffered during Mr. Tavakolis tenure, including a 42 percent drop in its stock price last year. Ambacs expenses rose under Mr. Tavakoli despite its projecting cost cuts during that same time.In a statement on Monday, Canyon said that it was nominating Frederick Arnold, the chief financial officer of Convergex Group; John R. Brecker, a director of ACA Financial Guaranty; and Eugene I. Davis, chief executive of the Pirinate Consulting Group.Canyon Capital believes these issues should be of the utmost concern to all Ambac stockholders and believes the companys performance will continue to suffer without significant changes in the boardroom, the hedge fund said in a statement.Canyon also is a creditor of Ambacs, with $259 million worth of exposure to the insurers bonds.Ambac has argued that those dual roles  of shareholder and debt investor  are a conflict of interest for Canyon.On Monday, Ambac hammered on that point, saying that we believe Canyon has a fundamental conflict of interest  its economic interests are aligned with certain creditors, not with shareholders.The rival slate, the company said, is a thinly veiled maneuver designed to accelerate payments on its own creditor position, regardless of the consequences for the company, other creditors and shareholders.But the hedge fund has argued that shareholders would do better as the company paid down its insurance claims.Ambac also said that it was in talks with shareholders about adding two new directors to its board and that it expected to announce the outcome shortly.Shares of Ambac were down 1.8 percent in early afternoon trading."}
{"text": "PEORIA, Ill.   Senator Ted Cruz, who rode a wave of voter fury to Tea Party stardom and once called the Republican majority leader a liar on the Senate floor, has begun appealing to our better angels.Less than three years after colleagues accused him of misleading his own supporters about the efficacy of a government shutdown, Mr. Cruz recently scolded Donald J. Trump for taking advantage of low-information voters.And while some of his allies took delight in Mr. Cruzs lack of endorsements from fellow senators, arguing that this solidified his standing as a Washington outsider, he has begun openly courting establishment figures with a practical pitch: I am your last, best hope.Come on in, Mr. Cruz told a crowd of thousands on Sunday in North Carolina, inviting supporters of other candidates to join him. The waters fine.If Mr. Trump defeats Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio in their home states on Tuesday  and perhaps even if he does not  Mr. Cruz is positioned as the candidate with the most realistic chance of chasing him down.But his task is delicate. Mr. Cruz is aiming to fuse two disparate strands in the Republican Party, trying to emerge as both the sober alternative to Mr. Trump and the solution to the boiling frustrations expressed by Trump and Cruz voters alike.Some Republicans despairing over Mr. Trumps rise have already lurched over to Mr. Cruz. He picked up his first Senate endorsement, from Mike Lee of Utah, last week. National Review, the stalwart conservative magazine, announced its support on Friday. Even Neil Bush, the brother of George W. and Jeb, has come on board.What remains unclear is the extent to which Mr. Cruz intends to meet anxious Republicans halfway, a choice testing his political dexterity as never before.He has sounded big-tent notes, invoking a bipartisan lineup of presidents  Ronald Reagan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy  in election-night speeches. He has said that he could see a place for opponents like Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich in a Cruz administration.He has reached out to Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a longtime foe, and met with Jeb Bush before last weeks Republican debate in Florida.At times, the effort to play party unifier has been bumpy. In an interview last week with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Mr. Cruz recalled Mr. Trumps recent quote, I love the poorly educated.Listen, part of it is, I think, Donald is taking advantage of his voters, Mr. Cruz said.The remark drew a furious response in some conservative circles. GOP Majority Voters in Primary are Wayyyyyy Beneath Cruz, So Says Cruz, Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor who is supporting Mr. Trump, wrote on Facebook.Perhaps no issue better illustrates Mr. Cruzs bind than his reactions to the violence at Trump rallies in recent days.On Friday, as skirmishes roiled a planned event in Chicago that was eventually canceled, Mr. Cruz sternly took Mr. Trump to task, saying he affirmatively encourages violence and disrespects the voters.The next day, Mr. Cruz recalibrated, focusing most of the blame on protesters and criticizing the Bernie Sanders campaign and the Black Lives Matter movement.He also defended his decision to support Mr. Trump if he is the Republican nominee, even as Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich wavered.Asked what Mr. Trump would have to do to lose his support, Mr. Cruz said Saturday, I dont really want to set a challenge for Donald to try and do something even more outrageous.By Monday morning, Mr. Cruz had settled on at least one deal-breaker: If, for example, he were to go out on Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, he told reporters in Illinois, I would not be willing to support Donald Trump.In January, Mr. Trump had surmised that he could do just that without paying an electoral price.Such utterances by Mr. Trump have helped drive even past skeptics into Mr. Cruzs corner.C. Boyden Gray, who worked in the White House under Reagan and the elder President George Bush, repeated Mr. Cruzs well-worn attacks against the Washington cartel without prompting in an interview on Monday.I know hes lost a lot of friends, or not made a lot of friends that he could have, in the so-called establishment, said Mr. Gray, who also served as ambassador to the European Union under George W. Bush. But he was running against Washington.No one outside Trump Tower has more effectively harnessed anti-Washington fervor. Mr. Cruz is so firmly committed to that theme that he cheered his own last-place finish in the District of Columbia on Saturday.Ive got to tell you, that result didnt surprise me at all, he told supporters with a grin.Still, among many of those who have worked with him, feelings remain raw. Josh Holmes, the former chief of staff to Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said it was a real open question as to whether people ultimately determine that Ted Cruz is any better for the Republican Party than Donald Trump.Its really an astonishing statement about the impression hes left, Mr. Holmes said, but its undeniably true given his inability to consolidate thus far.Yet if Mr. Cruz has made no apologies for his Senate tenure, he has also played down some elements of it on the trail  rarely speaking, for instance, about the 2013 government shutdown.Alice Stewart, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cruz, said he had no plans to adjust his message but acknowledged that the campaign had entered a different phase, requiring Mr. Cruz to speak to voters who did not initially view him as their first choice.Thats not a pitch youd make a month ago or two, three, four months ago, she said.In a primary season dominated by Mr. Trump, some voters may not require much cajoling, and Cruz allies predict more public defections this week if Mr. Rubio exits the race.Austin Barbour, a Republican strategist in Mississippi who had previously backed Rick Perry and Jeb Bush, said he voted for Mr. Cruz in his states primary last week for a simple reason.I know hes a Republican, and I know hes a conservative, Mr. Barbour said. I cant say that about Donald Trump."}
{"text": "Carrying horns, handwritten signs and bottles of gasoline to set tires on fire, a group of men marched into one of the many protests that have paralyzed parts of the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, this year.They were angry with their president, who let Parliament collapse and failed to hold scheduled elections. They were angry with the United Nations for not ensuring a fair vote for his successor. And they were angry with the former American secretary of state who had helped put him in power.You see all these people here? said one of the Haitian-flag-draped protesters, Jean Renold Cenatus, 32, who said he was unemployed. Its because of what Mrs. Clinton did five years ago that we are facing this situation.In their post-2000 lives as global citizens, Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton have been tied to no country more closely than Haiti. As a United Nations special envoy, Mr. Clinton helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars for the country after its devastating 2010 earthquake. Mrs. Clinton traveled there four times as secretary of state and shepherded billions of dollars in American aid.They often speak fondly of Haiti, one of the first places they visited as newlyweds in 1975.We came here for the first time together, just after we were married, and fell in love with Haiti, Mrs. Clinton said in 2012, standing near her husband at the opening of a Haitian industrial park she helped to finance. We have had a deep connection to and with Haiti ever since.But as she seeks the worlds most powerful job and Haiti plunges into another political abyss, a loud segment of Haitians and Haitian-Americans is speaking of the Clintons with the same contempt they reserve for some of their past leaders.In widely read blogs, in protests in Port-au-Prince and outside Mrs. Clintons campaign headquarters in Brooklyn, and on popular call-in radio shows in Florida, where primaries will be held on Tuesday, the Clintons have become prime targets of blame for the countrys woes.Among the litany of complaints being laid at their feet: Fewer than half the jobs promised at the industrial park, built after 366 farmers were evicted from their lands, have materialized. Many millions of dollars earmarked for relief efforts have yet to be spent. Mrs. Clintons brother Tony Rodham has turned up in business ventures on the island, setting off speculation about insider deals.A vote for Hillary Clinton means further corruption, further death and destruction for our people, said Dahoud Andre, a radio show host in New York who has helped organize protests against the Clintons. It means more Haitians leaving Haiti and not being able to live in our country.And now, Michel Martelly, a president whom Mrs. Clinton helped get elected, has turned out to be another in a long line of troubling leaders.Tony Jeanthenor, 55, a member of the Miami-based Haitian human rights group Veye-Yo as well as Lavalas Family, a Haitian political party, said he was voting for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont because of the senators distaste for involvement in other countries affairs.Nothing good for Haiti can come out of Hillary because of her past behavior, Mr. Jeanthenor said.The dismay over Mrs. Clinton in South Floridas Haitian community is not likely to affect her fortunes on Tuesday, as she holds a comfortable lead over Mr. Sanders in state polls. Whether it could damage her in a general election is unclear. An estimated 150,000 Haitian-American voters live in Florida, the state where 537 votes decided the 2000 election. But they have also overwhelmingly voted for Democrats, according to Fernand R. Amandi, a principal partner of Bendixen & Amandi International, a public opinion research firm in Miami that has polled Haitian-Americans extensively.Jean Monestime, a Haitian-American who is the chairman of the Miami-Dade County Commission as well as a chairman of Caribbean Americans for Hillary, said he had spoken to the Clinton campaign about the criticisms. But many Haitian-Americans in South Florida still appreciate her efforts on the countrys behalf, he said, and intended to vote for her.The others should not keep whining and complaining, he said, because if another candidate wins, one who is less interested in Haiti, we are going to be marginalized by the change.Indeed, the Clintons have been involved extensively in Haiti for years. Mr. Clinton won the praise of many Haitians by sending in 20,000 American troops to return Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the countrys former president, to power in 1994, three years after he was ousted in a military coup.The Clintons had large roles in the earthquake recovery effort, Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state and Mr. Clinton as co-chairman of the Interim Haiti Recovery Commission. Along with his predecessor in the White House, the elder George Bush, Mr. Clinton raised tens of millions of dollars through the Clinton Foundation to promote development, schools and farming in Haiti, while also helping draw hundreds of millions in private investments.Officials at the Clinton Foundation said they were not surprised by some of the disappointment, given that even before the earthquake, Haiti was one of the worlds poorest countries. Now, the average family gets by on $1.25 a day.Jake Sullivan, Mrs. Clintons deputy chief of staff for policy at the State Department and now the senior policy adviser for her campaign, said the United States work under Mrs. Clintons leadership certainly had a significant impact in support of Haitis recovery.Our commitment of more than $4 billion since 2010 has helped provide shelter for more than 300,000 Haitians; health care for more than half the country in U.S.-supported facilities; train a new national police force; and raise the average incomes of tens of thousands of farmers, Mr. Sullivan said in an email. Secretary Clinton is extremely proud of the work she and her team have done since the earthquake.But to many Haitians, the most significant moment of Mrs. Clintons tenure as secretary of state was in 2011, when she flew to Haiti to pressure President Ren Prval to admit Mr. Martelly, a popular recording artist, into a two-person runoff for president. Mr. Martelly was third in initial voting, but the Organization of American States believed that the man who was second, Mr. Prvals pick, had benefited from vote fraud.The night of the runoff, which Mr. Martelly won, Mrs. Clintons chief of staff, Cheryl D. Mills, wrote a congratulatory note to top American diplomats in Haiti.You do great elections, Ms. Mills wrote in a message released by the State Department among a batch of Mrs. Clintons emails. She wrote that she would buy dinner the next time she visited: We can discuss how the counting is going! Just kidding. Kinda. :)Ms. Millss email may have been intended as tongue in cheek, but it has fed a suspicion among Haitians, if lacking in proof, that the United States rigged the election to install a puppet president.And as Mr. Martelly slowly concentrated power around him and gave important jobs to friends with criminal pasts, the woman who had helped put him in the runoff began to come under attack. (Mr. Martelly left office last month, as scheduled, but without a successor in place.)After Mrs. Clinton declared her candidacy for president of the United States, calls began coming in to Mr. Andres radio show, like one in June in which a woman lamented that she and her late father had been supporters of The Clintons and had donated money to help elect each to office. When they did good things, we should applaud, the woman said in Haitian Creole. But when they do bad things, we should denounce them because it is not good. And Hillary Clinton is not good.The activities of Mr. Rodham, Mrs. Clintons brother, are frequently mentioned on the shows. Last year a book, Clinton Cash by Peter Schweizer, revealed that in 2013, Mr. Rodham was added to the advisory board of a company that owns a gold mine in Haiti. He and the companys chief executive both told The Washington Post that they had been introduced at a meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative, an arm of the Clinton Foundation. Officials at the foundation said they had not played a part in Mr. Rodhams joining the mining company.Mr. Rodham and several partners also sought a $22 million deal to rebuild homes in the country while Mr. Clinton was leading the recovery commission. They were not successful.While there is no evidence that Mr. Rodham got preferential treatment, his ventures were quickly inflated into rumors, heard often on the streets and airwaves, that the Clintons had been busy buying land in Haiti for profit.Outspoken activists like Ezili Dant, a human rights lawyer who founded the Haitian Lawyers Leadership Network, say they cannot help believing that Mrs. Clinton gave her brother a hand.She is looked upon as a liberal and someone who respects human rights, workers rights and so forth, Ms. Dant said. But we havent had that experience with her in Haiti.The Rev. Philius Nicolas, 85, of Brooklyn, an elder statesman of the Haitian community in New York, said he had heard all the complaints and understood the frustration.But Mr. Nicolas, who proudly displays in his church office a photo of him and other Haitian-Americans standing with Mrs. Clinton during her 2000 Senate campaign, said he was going to vote for her again. He said he thought she would be the best leader for the United States, Haitis biggest benefactor.We cant vote for a president because of Haiti only, Mr. Nicolas said. If things go bad in the United States, we are the first ones who are going to get hurt. First and foremost, we need something good for us and then for back home."}
{"text": "NORTH BENNINGTON, Vt.  Above the Walloomsac River, where ramshackle farmhouses sit just downhill from tidy homes with organic gardens out back, the old ChemFab plant was, for many, a respected local employer from the days when this villages prosperity depended on industry.For others, it was an eyesore and a nuisance, its smokestacks choking their homes with an acrid smell that seemed to cause headaches, sore throats and nosebleeds. But since the plant shut down more than a dozen years ago, few had given a thought to its environmental legacy.In recent weeks, however, several private wells near the ChemFab plant have tested positive for an industrial chemical that has been linked to cancer, thyroid disease and serious complications during pregnancy, making North Bennington  better known for its bed-and-breakfasts and Bennington College  the latest in a growing list of Northeastern communities unsettled by a contaminated-water scare.It started across the New York border in the village of Hoosick Falls, where the discovery of the chemical, perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, in the public drinking water has prompted residents to rely on bottled water amid charges that the state took far too long to respond. It was found in public wells in Petersburgh, N.Y., the site of a plastics factory south of Hoosick Falls.And last week, as environmental officials in Vermont and New York mounted statewide searches for other potentially contaminated areas, officials in Merrimack, N.H., home to yet another chemical plant, announced that the chemical had cropped up there, too.From an environmental perspective, we kind of fell asleep at the wheel when it came to those components, said Kiah Morris, the Vermont state representative whose legislative district includes Bennington. Theres things we didnt know, and theres things we hoped we wouldnt find out.The number of people found to be drinking water tainted by PFOA is almost certain to grow. PFOA was once used to manufacture a legion of modern conveniences including nonstick pans, microwaveable popcorn wrappers and Gore-Tex boots  practically anything that is nonstick, stain-resistant or water-repellent  but its health effects and the way it spreads are not well understood. But even as the chemical continues to contaminate water across the country, scientists say, government agencies at all levels, from local health departments to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, have yet to grapple with the full extent of the problem, or with what it will take to clean it up.I think when people look, said Arlene Blum, the executive director of the Green Science Policy Institute, theyre going to find it.The State of Vermont is now sampling 185 private wells in North Bennington, all of which fall within a 1.5-mile radius of the ChemFab plant, which closed in 2002. Bottled water has been distributed. Carbon-filtration systems, an imperfect and temporary fix, have been installed on some wells.Every time I think about it, I just feel like crying, said Virginia Barber, 64, who since 1977 has lived in a house no bigger than a trailer at the end of Scarey Lane, overlooking the factory. Hers was one of the first few wells in the village to test positive for PFOA.Ms. Barber, her husband and their two dogs are drinking bottled water; she is unsure whether she should bathe the dogs in it, too. She keeps her showers short. She does not know whether to rinse pasta in the well water. She keeps reminding herself that she cannot use the ice from the automatic ice-maker.Her husband, David Barber, 67, worked at the plant for 21 years, coating fabrics in the Teflon material. He recalled seeing small specks of the material get stuck on the ends of co-workers cigarettes and turn to ash as the smokers inhaled that, too. Within a couple of hours, they would get chills and sweats, as if they were coming down with the flu.We were kind of young and foolish, Mr. Barber said. We never really talked about it; we never really thought too much about it. It paid good, and they treated us fairly well.An analysis earlier this month by the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit organization that has urged the E.P.A. to lower the level at which it says water with PFOA is safe to drink, found that the chemical had been detected in 103 water systems, serving nearly seven million people in 27 states. (That does not include smaller water systems like those of Hoosick Falls or Petersburgh, which were not covered under the agencys testing program.)The E.P.A. does not have a formal regulatory standard for the chemical, relying instead on a provisional health advisory level for drinking water, which it has announced it will update this spring. Some states lack even that.Trying to beat back criticism that New York States response in Hoosick Falls was, at best, blinkered  the state repeatedly said its water was safe last year before declaring it a Superfund site in January  New York officials have suggested that the fault lay with the absence of strong guidelines from the federal agency. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo again called on the E.P.A. to release a long-term advisory level for the chemical on Sunday, when he visited Hoosick Falls for the first time after its water was deemed unsafe.Were going to continue to find situations like this all throughout the state, all throughout the country, he said.In Vermont, the Health Department did not issue a health advisory level for the chemical  at 20 parts per trillion, it is well below that of the federal guideline set for Hoosick Falls, which is 100  until state environmental officials began testing wells in North Bennington last month. They, in turn, had become aware of the possibility of contamination there only after one resident, alarmed by the news from Hoosick Falls, contacted local elected officials.Tests have shown that the public water supplies of both Bennington and North Bennington, which serve a vast majority of residents, are free of PFOA.We didnt really know about it, we werent testing for it, but now we know about it, were testing for it, were starting to look at where else it may be, said Chuck Schwer, the state environmental departments director of waste management and prevention, who has begun identifying other industrial sites across the state that may need testing. Were still in the very early stages, but now that we know, its like, we cant have another North Bennington situation catch us off guard.There were some here who were concerned that the ChemFab plant was not following regulations, like Annette Griffith, 51, who worked there for five years in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Ms. Griffith said she brought her concerns about smoke and workers health problems to managers several times, only to be ignored.Now she wonders whether she should have been even more outspoken. She was eight months pregnant when she left ChemFab, and her son was born with learning disabilities.Theres no way they didnt know, Ms. Griffith said.A spokeswoman for Saint-Gobain, the company that owns the plants in Hoosick Falls and Merrimack, and took over the ChemFab plant in 2000, said she could not comment on what happened before our tenure. The spokeswoman, Dina Silver Pokedoff, said Saint-Gobain had offered to pay for bottled water and filtration systems for those affected.When Andy Beckerman, 70, and Carol Poppe, 65, moved into their home near the ChemFab plant about 18 years ago, they noticed a nauseating odor seeping in at all hours, as if something sugary had burned in the oven. Their next-door neighbor, Sandy Sumner, 63, and his wife often woke up with sore throats, migraines and nosebleeds.Here we are, organic everything, and now were blasted with PFOA, said Ms. Poppe, laughing ruefully at the thought of the organic soil they had brought in for their vegetable patch.Many residents also worry about the values of their houses, which are likely to plummet with the mere mention of water contamination. Were middle class; we dont have a ton of change, Mr. Sumner said. He said he and his wife were planning to use the proceeds from the house to retire. But now, he said, were going to have to stay here until we cant stay here anymore.In the nearby rural village of Petersburgh, where Taconic Plasticss plant on Coon Brook Road is by far the biggest employer, PFOA was found in public wells that serve dozens of families after Taconic notified New York officials that the plants water had tested positive for the chemical.Taconic had found high levels of PFOA in its water a decade ago, officials said; it was apparently concerned enough to provide filtration systems and bottled water to homes by the plant. But though it informed the state in 2005, the discovery did not raise alarms at the state level until recently because PFOA was, and remains, an unregulated contaminant, state officials said.Rory Lynch, whose private well in Petersburgh is being tested, said she had thought about leaving the home that has been hers since 1976. One option, she said, was to move near her son in Colorado. Then came a caveat.I dont know if they have PFOA, too, she said."}
{"text": "I know my television is too loud.Im asking people to repeat themselves more often.Im the restaurant patron asking the manager to please turn down the music so I can hear my friends across the table.Almost two-thirds of Americans older than 70 have meaningful hearing loss, experts say, and I probably will be among them. I should do something about it.One reason I havent is the average price for hearing aids: roughly $2,500, often more  and most of us need two. That helps explain why only 20 percent of those with hearing loss use hearing aids.Medicare declines to cover a number of products and services that older beneficiaries need. Dental care ranks high on my personal list of exclusions that make the least sense, but the fact that the 1965 Medicare law specifically prohibits the national insurance program from paying for hearing aids is also a strong contender.So its heartening to notice some recent developments that might lead to more rational policies and more affordable and accessible devices. An October report by the Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology recommended federal actions to simultaneously decrease the cost of hearing aids, spur technology innovation and increase consumer choice options.The council suggested, for example, that the Food and Drug Administration permit a basic hearing aid, for mild to moderate age-related hearing loss, to be sold over the counter  something every state prohibits.The report also urged the Federal Trade Commission, whose rulings enabled consumers to comparison shop for eyeglasses and contact lenses, to treat hearing devices more like visual ones. It should be like a prescription for eyeglasses, said Dr. Christine Cassel, a co-chairwoman of the councils hearing technologies working group.The hearing aid itself represents only about a third of what audiologists charge. (Medicare does cover testing with a physicians referral.)After an audiologist or physician provides an audiogram assessing your hearing, Dr. Cassel said, you should be able to take it with you and shop around for the best prices on devices. In June, the Institute of Medicine will issue a report on hearing health that tackles key questions like federal regulation, insurance and price. A number of major players  among them the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute on Aging and the Pentagon  have sponsored the yearlong effort. The F.D.A., acting on recommendations by the presidents council, will host a public workshop next month to consider whether its hearing aid regulations may hinder innovation, reduce competition and lead to increased cost and reduced use.The agency has also reopened public comments on proposed regulation of so-called personal sound amplification products and their marketing.Reports, comments, workshops  we can be forgiven for rolling our eyes and wondering if anything useful will emerge. Still, these actions represent a greater national focus on hearing loss and rehabilitation than we have seen in decades.Whats driving this interest, apart from the demographic bulge that means the hearing-impaired population is about to grow much larger, is a wave of new research.Congress banned Medicare coverage of hearing aids 50 years ago because people thought hearing loss was just a normal part of aging, said Dr. Cassel, one of the authors of a recent JAMA editorial on hearing health policies. They didnt see it as a disability or a medical problem.But were learning that, however normal, hearing loss can have significant consequences.Older adults with poor hearing report a greater number of falls than those with normal hearing, a Finnish study found. American researchers have demonstrated a similar association in those 40 to 69.Older adults with hearing loss are also more apt to report periods of poor physical and mental health, and to be hospitalized.Perhaps most disturbing, studies also show a relationship between hearing loss  mild, moderate or severe  and accelerated rates of cognitive decline. Older people with hearing loss also are more likely than those with normal hearing to develop dementia.How can aging ears affect so many other aspects of our health? Dr. Frank Lin, an otolaryngologist and epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University who has led many of these research efforts, points to several possible causes. With diminished hearing, your brain is constantly having to work harder to process garbled sounds  a concept called cognitive load  and may have less capacity for other mental tasks.Alternatively, hearing loss may lead to changes in brain structure. In one of Dr. Lins studies, magnetic resonance imaging tests showed greater brain atrophy among those with poor hearing.A struggle to hear can also lead to isolation, and weve known for years that social connectedness is important for cognitive health, Dr. Lin added.Technology put the Internet in our pockets, but hasnt done much to affordably improve our hearing.In every other aspect of our lives, advances in electronic technology have made things cost much, much less, Dr. Cassel said. That hasnt happened with hearing aids.Almost annually, she added, some congressperson gets energized about this and tries to pass legislation to remove Medicares hearing aid restriction. Last year, it was Representative Debbie Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, with six Democratic co-sponsors. The bill stalled in committee, but we are not giving up the fight, Ms. Dingell said in an email.Driving down the cost of the devices could make them more widely available in several ways.If its $200 instead of $2,000, more people could pay out of pocket, Dr. Cassell said. And that also means Medicare might cover it  unlikely at current prices.Its clearly possible to provide good devices for far less than we now pay. The Department of Veterans Affairs, which negotiates with manufacturers for lower prices, provided comprehensive hearing care to more than 900,000 veterans in 2014 and dispensed almost 800,000 hearing aids without copays. The average cost per device: $400.Price isnt the only obstacle to wider use. In European countries where insurance does cover hearing aids, theyre still underused. Clearly, our discomfort with age-related disability plays a role.So do the shortcomings of hearing aids. Though theyre improving, no technology will ever correct hearing loss like glasses correct vision, Dr. Lin said.As hearing declines with age, the cochlea, the part of the inner ear that receives and transmits sound, sustains irreversible damage.Still, the way we acquire hearing aids, or dont, has costs beyond the obvious. Daunted by the multiple visits, the adjustments and especially the expense, people often delay for years while their mild or moderate hearing loss worsens.Over that time, youve lost some of the neural pathways from the ear to the brain, Dr. Lin said. With longstanding hearing loss, rehabilitation is much harder. The earlier you address it, the easier it is and the more successful you can be."}
{"text": "The charges were unusual enough: A Drug Enforcement Administration official and a civilian D.E.A. employee in New York City were accused of lying during national security background checks about their ownership of a strip club in South Hackensack, N.J.The two men worked regular shifts at the club, the Twins Plus Go-Go Lounge, hiring and firing dancers and bouncers, and monitoring activities through a video surveillance system, the government has said.As the case heads toward trial, expected to begin in May, defense lawyers have indicated that they may call agency employees to testify that the mens ownership in the club was an open secret at the D.E.A., and that members of law enforcement even frequented the lounge. But the defense contends that the government is intentionally trying to hamper that strategy.David Polos, 51, a former assistant special agent in charge who helped to supervise the New York Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Strike Force, and Glen Glover, 46, a telecommunications specialist, have been indicted on charges of conspiracy and making false statements.During the background checks, they said they had no employment outside the D.E.A., when in fact they had ownership interests in the club and actively managed it while working for the agency, prosecutors have charged in a federal complaint. Mr. Polos has since retired, while Mr. Glover has been placed on an indefinite suspension, the agency said.Defense lawyers have objected to a federal regulation that requires them to obtain the agencys approval before an employee can testify. The rule is designed to ensure such witnesses do not reveal classified or other sensitive information, prosecutors have said in court papers.This is not just a theoretical concern in this case, the prosecutors, Martin S. Bell and Andrew D. Goldstein, said in a brief submitted to Judge Paul G. Gardephe of Federal District Court in Manhattan.While much of the testimony would likely be unobjectionable, they said, Mr. Glover had worked on numerous highly sensitive investigations, and it was thus possible that the testimony of witnesses he intends to call in his defense will need to be limited to ensure that classified or confidential information is not disclosed.In court on Monday, Mr. Poloss lawyer, Marc L. Mukasey, said the agency was using the rule as a public relations device.The rule was being invoked somewhere in the D.E.A., he argued, not to protect privileged and confidential D.E.A. investigations, but to protect the agents and the agency from the fact that some of their agents may have gone to a strip club.Whats really going on here, Mr. Mukasey said, is they want to shut down the fact that D.E.A. agents go to adult establishments, which is an absolute legal right.Mr. Goldstein, one of the prosecutors, said there was no evidence to support that allegation.Mr. Glovers lawyer, Cathy Fleming, said in a brief that many of her clients friends who worked at the agency had visited the strip club and knew he was an owner. Some offered business advice. Some offered help, she wrote.In court, she told Judge Gardephe that the invocation of the rule had chilled people from speaking to the defense. People are scared, she said.Ms. Fleming has also filed a statement by a defense investigator who said he had received a call from a D.E.A. agent who advised me that no one at D.E.A. would be allowed to speak with members of Glen Glovers defense team without permission from the agencys top official in New York.Mr. Goldstein said in court that the government had not and would not direct D.E.A. witnesses not to meet with the defense, nor did he believe there had been any such blanket edict issued within the agency. He told the judge that he would check to make sure.Judge Gardephe asked that he do so. Let me just say, the judge added, that if a supervisor had instructed potential witnesses that they could not meet with the defense, or that if they met with the defense they would likely be subject to some sort of disciplinary action, I would find that very troubling.The D.E.A. and the United States attorneys office in Manhattan declined to comment."}
{"text": "The American Bar Associations accrediting body put law schools on notice Monday that it intended to tighten a rule that sets a deadline for graduates to pass state bar exams  a near-universal requirement for becoming a practicing lawyer.The new measure would clarify the existing deadline that 75 percent of students pass within two years. Bar passage rates have been falling noticeably across the country.At issue for the schools is their accreditation by the association. The theory behind the rule, which is one factor in accreditation, is that schools should be accepting students who are likely to have the qualifications to become practicing lawyers. Proponents of the change say that schools exploit students when they accept those who  based on admissions tests and other measurements  have a small chance of succeeding.Although the current rule was intended to require passage of the bar in two years, the language is fuzzy and full of loopholes that effectively give schools as long as five years to meet the goal.The change would eliminate more than 700 words of explanation from the rule as it stands now, and leave a single sentence.The vagueness in the existing rule has allowed most schools to avoid being held accountable, although at least two, both in California, were placed on probation for low bar passage rates. The probation of each has since been lifted. Accreditation of two other California schools was temporarily withdrawn, in part because of bar passage issues.The revision, proposed by the associations Section of Legal Education and Admission to the Bar, is subject to a hearing and a comment period. Approval by the full A.B.A. would most likely come in February 2017. Some schools are expected to push back against the effort to place a firm lid on student outcomes, especially if they have elected to admit students with less traditional qualifications.Bar exam passage rates have been dropping in big states including California, New York, Florida and New Jersey. Georgia, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia also were stung by lower passage rates after the July 2015 exam. The bar exam is also given in February, but most graduates take it the summer after their graduation from law school.The bar passage rate in California, for example, sank last year to its lowest point since 1986. In New York, the overall passage rate for test takers last July was at its lowest point since 2004. Floridas rate also dropped slightly, although other big states like New Jersey had steady overall passage rates.Entering the legal profession means measuring up to tough standards, but the numerical qualifications, like admissions test scores and grade point averages, of students have declined, and fewer people are applying to law school. The number of applicants last year fell to 54,130 compared with just under 88,000 five years earlier, according to the Law School Admissions Council, which tracks the data."}
{"text": "The finals of the National Council Auditions that the Metropolitan Opera hosts each year must be daunting for the young contestants who vie for one of five top prizes. Its not just one of the most reliably career-accelerating competitions in opera. Its also held in the largest opera house, with an auditorium that can dwarf even experienced voices.But when the Korean-born baritone Sol Jin took the stage on Sunday afternoon to perform Di Provenza il mar from Verdis La Traviata, something odd happened: The hall seemed to shrink, filled to the brim with the sound of a majestic, powerful and elegantly burnished voice.It happened again when Mr. Jin, the third of this years nine finalists, who all performed with the Met Orchestra under the baton of Antony Walker, returned to sing a selection from Tchaikovskys The Queen of Spades. Both these pieces are lyrical arias demanding expression and nuance rather than gladiatorial prowess, and Mr. Jin delivered singing of mature refinement, buoyed by such commanding amplitude and projection that a visible jolt went through the audience each time he sang.There was little surprise mixed in with the cheers, then, when the soprano Deborah Voigt, the host of Sundays proceedings, announced Mr. Jin as one of the winners. Also memorable was the soprano Yelena Dyachek from California, who demonstrated impressive range, depth and power in Come scoglio from Mozarts Cos Fan Tutte before delivering an emotionally captivating Letter Scene from Tchaikovskys Eugene Onegin.The Polish countertenor Jakub Jozef Orlinski combined beauty of tone and an uncommon unity of color and polish across his range in selections by Britten and Handel. The Italian-Canadian mezzo Emily DAngelo, with a voice hued like polished teak, proved vivacious and nimble in a Rossini comic number, and arrestingly vulnerable in an aria from Barbers Vanessa. Also deservedly among the winners was the baritone Sean Michael Plumb, who brought elegant lyricism and responsive musicality to music by Rossini and Tchaikovsky.If I could have awarded one more prize, it would have gone to the baritone Theo Hoffman, who sang scenes from Korngolds Die Tote Stadt and Glucks Iphignie en Tauride with refined intensity and  especially in the Korngold  a seemingly intuitive understanding of how to integrate a voice into a plush orchestral texture.It was also gratifying to see singers who had seemed uncomfortable in their first arias improve in the second half. The tenor Jonas Hacker, who had struggled to unify melody and ornament in a Mozart aria, came back with a selection from Delibess Lakm that allowed the sweetness of his tone to unfold freely. The profusion of quick-patter language in Largo al factotum from Rossinis The Barber of Seville had gotten the better of the baritone Brian Vu at the start of the afternoon; when he returned with an aria from Gounods Faust the broad lyrical line revealed an ample and pleasing tone. The mellow warmth of Lauren Feiders soprano lit up selections from Strausss Arabella and Brittens Peter Grimes, part of an afternoon that  as competitions go  offered a satisfying range of repertoire."}
{"text": "At Slymans Restaurant in Cleveland on Monday morning, the customers were upholding their states purple reputation well. At one table, a Trump fan chatted with a man leaning toward Gov. John Kasich. At others sat Sanders and Trump supporters. Two patrons came in dressed in green, a few days early for St. Patricks Day  they were planning to vote for Clinton.The restaurant, famous for its giant corned beef sandwiches, has hosted George W. Bush and Joe Biden. Freddy Slyman, who was operating the meat slicer and whose parents own the place, assured me the restaurant is non-partisan. Whoever wants to come in, were here.What was clear amid the bustle of Slymans  and elsewhere in Ohio  was something pollsters have been cautioning for some time. While Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump may be ahead in their delegate counts, both inspire deep misgivings in voters that could hurt them in the general election.For Mrs. Clinton, the biggest issue is trust. Anita Hess, who was at Slymans having breakfast with her family, is a Republican, but plans to vote for Bernie Sanders on Tuesday. A registered nurse, she likes the senators plan for health care. And, she said, I like what Bernie has to say. Bernie is like talking to the guy next door.For her, Hillary Clinton doesnt have the same quality. It seems like shes saying what people want to hear. Shes also troubled by Mrs. Clintons use of a private email server. That to me is shady, she said.Pebbles Bush, a longtime Sanders supporter, said his consistency is what really got me.  Her tablemate, Beverly Harris, is undecided but leaning toward Sanders. She said Mrs. Clinton kind of wavers back and forth on issues.She calls herself a progressive, but shes a centrist, said Ms. Bush. To me Bernie is the ideal, and Hillary is the centrist candidate, the establishment candidate.Eating lunch at a Subway in Lorain, Ohio, about 30 miles west of Cleveland, Ed Oliveras said hell vote for Mrs. Clinton if shes the nominee  unless she faces Mr. Kasich. For me, really its about creating jobs, he explained. Kasichs done that very well.I think Hillary has too much baggage, he said, stretching back to her husbands presidency. She has a long way to go to prove that shes trustworthy.Mr. Trumps problems are different. His supporters trust him, even in areas where hes been inconsistent. At Slymans, Marlene Silverstein said that although shes pro-choice, she plans to vote for Mr. Trump. If he gets the chance to appoint a justice to the Supreme Court, she believes hell choose someone whos moderate on abortion. He used to be pro-choice, she explained, and hes a negotiator, so I think that might be something that he would be willing to negotiate.And David J. Moore, the Lorain County chairman for the Trump campaign, said Mr. Trump is doing well in an area thats traditionally solidly Democratic. We talked at the Trump campaigns Lorain office, opened earlier this year in a shopping center with a dollar store, a post office, and a Chinese restaurant. On nearby Broadway, many storefronts stand vacant.The area has suffered since the steel industry started cutting jobs, said Mr. Moore, and Mr. Trump is succeeding because hes talking about jobs, hes talking about debt, hes talking about trade deals. He was very optimistic about a Trump victory on Tuesday: My prediction is 11 points.While supporters see the Trump campaigns broad appeal, others see something different  a cult of personality, a lack of substance, a candidate whose vision of America doesnt include all Americans.Hes not saying to vote Republican, said Lincoln Hess at Slymans. Hes saying pledge an oath of allegiance to me. And the last guy to do that was saying it in German.Ms. Harris said she is troubled by Mr. Trumps comments on race and Muslims. He says he wants to make America great again, in what way? His message, she says, really means he wants the country more white.And Ms. Bush said, Hes so extreme, but he doesnt have any policies. Theres no policy, theres no platform, theres nothing concrete in anything he says.Is this our government now? she asked. Our government is not a reality show."}

A recent fossil finding in Uzbekistan is providing paleontologists with a missing link in the lineage: They have discovered a tyrannosaur with many of the giants characteristics  but not its stature or heft.It has long been thought that tyrannosaurs were such successful predators, in part, because of their large brains and ears well-attuned to low-frequency sound, said Stephen L. Brusatte, a paleontologist at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and lead author of a paper published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, describing the new dinosaur. The new Uzbek tyrannosaur has basically the same brain as T. rex  same shape, proportions, etc.  just smaller.The finding, he said, is a new indication that tyrannosaurs got smart before they got big.It is one of the closest cousins of T. rex and tells us that tyrannosaurs evolved sophisticated brains and senses before they became colossal apex predators, Dr. Brusatte said.When the first tyrannosaurs evolved, about 170 million years ago, they lived in the shadows of larger meat-eaters like Allosaurus. For tens of millions of years, tyrannosaurs remained small.And because few rocks of the age 100 million years to 80 million years old are now lying exposed or at the surface anywhere in the world, few clues exist to explain how the early tyrannosaurs evolved into large animals like T. rex.The fossil record just stops, Dr. Brusatte said. We dont know what goes on in that time.Before the gap, all tyrannosaurs were small. After the gap, none were. Tyrannosaurus rex and its relatives weighed one ton or more.Uzbekistan is one of the few places with geological formations that fall in that 20-million-year gap. Beginning in 1997, Hans-Dieter Sues, chairman of the paleobiology department at the Smithsonians National Museum of Natural History, and Alexander O. Averianov, a senior scientist at the Russian Academy of Sciences, organized fossil-collecting expeditions to the Kyzylkum Desert in northern Uzbekistan.The paleontologists uncovered some scattered bones of what appeared to be tyrannosaurs, but the key finding came in 2004 when they found the part of the skull surrounding the brain.The braincase proved to be the Rosetta stone for the whole thing, Dr. Sues said.Dr. Brusatte, an expert on tyrannosaurs, was visiting Dr. Averianov a couple of years ago to study some other fossils. He pulled open a box and pulled out this object about the size of a grapefruit, Dr. Brusatte recalled. And he handed it to me and said, You know, what do you make of this?Dr. Brusatte joined an international team of researchers, including Dr. Sues and Dr. Averianov, in the analysis of the new tyrannosaur. Named Timurlengia euotica, the dinosaur lived about 90 million years ago, right in the middle of the fossil gap. (Timurlengia was named after a Central Asian warlord, Timur; euotica roughly means well eared.)Based on a few scattered bones, the scientists estimated that Timurlengia was about the size of a horse, like earlier tyrannosaurs, weighing about 600 pounds, with long legs and blade-like teeth. Lithe and fast, it probably chased down plant eaters like early duck-billed dinosaurs also found in the region.But a CT scan of the braincase showed that the shape of the brain was similar to that of the later tyrannosaurs, and that the inner ear structure was tuned to low frequencies.We were very surprised it already had this sensory organization associated with T. rex and related animals, Dr. Sues said.Timurlengia does not explain why tyrannosaurs got big, but Dr. Sues said he suspected that an unusually warm climate, one of the warmest in Earths history, had played an important role. Allosaurus and its relatives did not adapt and died out, and then tyrannosaurs grew in size to replace them.So far, Timurlengia is just one clue. It is possible, for instance, that larger tyrannosaurs had already evolved elsewhere. Like at a murder scene, Dr. Brusatte said, one clue is better than none.A tyrannosaur from China named Xiongguanlong, imprecisely dated to 100 million to 120 million years ago, is another important clue.At a glance, Xiangguanlong looks to my eye like an advanced tyrannosaur, said Thomas \nCarr, a paleontologist at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis., who has examined the braincase fossil.This is what this work is all about, completing that evolutionary narrative, Dr. Carr said. At the end of the day, theres much more to discover. Its still a great leap from Timurlengia to T. rex."}
{"text": "An insurrection now threatens the future of the Republican Party  an insurrection of white working class voters who have been among the partys most loyal supporters since the civil rights movement of the 1960s. These men and women felt that they lacked an effective political voice, until they heard the siren call of Donald J. Trump.Could the Democratic Party face a comparable revolt?Beginning with the administration of Lyndon Baines Johnson, African-American voters have provided Democrats with their margin of victory in elections at every level across the nation, year after year.How have African-American voters been faring over all? Badly. The Democratic debt to black voters is immense, and the party has not paid up.There is no evidence yet of a political rebellion parallel to the one taking place in the Republican Party, despite the fact that poor black Americans are having a much tougher time than the white working class Republicans flocking to Trump.One key measure of how well a demographic group is doing is the percentage of children living in communities of high concentrated poverty, in so-called toxic social environments.There is a rapidly growing body of evidence, compiled by economists, sociologists and public policy experts, which demonstrates the depth of the damage inflicted on children in such toxic neighborhoods.Thirty years of research has converged on a clear and compelling fact: Its not just the family a child is born into that determines her fate, but the neighborhood she grows up in, Stefanie DeLuca, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins, wrote to me.DeLuca is one of the authors of a forthcoming book, Coming of Age in the Other America, along with Susan Clampet-Lundquist and Kathryn Edin. The book provides evidence that African-American children born in Baltimores large public housing projects made significant educational gains relative to their parents when their families left the projects, using federally issued housing vouchers to move to privately owned properties.Reed Jordan, of the Urban Institute, describes in detail how detrimental the effects of impoverished neighborhoods like the constant anxietyElaborating further, Jordan continues:Another researcher who has mapped the impact of concentrated poverty is Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at N.Y.U. Sharkey emailed his findings to me:Sharkey points out thatIn a 2009 Pew Charitable Trusts report, Neighborhoods and the Black-White Mobility Gap, Sharkey argued that:Elizabeth Kneebone, a Brookings Institution scholar, confirms the brutal impact on poor families of concentrated deprivation. In a 2014 essay, The Growth and Spread of Concentrated Poverty, she reported that:During the 1990s, there was a substantial decline in the percentage of families of all races and ethnicities, including African Americans, living in neighborhoods of dense poverty.From 1990 to 2000, the percentage of poor black individuals and families living in neighborhoods where the poverty rate was 40 percent or higher fell from 30 percent to 19 percent.Since 2000, however, this favorable trend sharply reversed, and the post-2009 economic recovery has not improved matters.By 2014, according to the most recent data from the Annie E. Casey Foundation, 32 percent of black children were living in neighborhoods where the poverty rate is 30 percent or more. A higher percentage of black children live in impoverished neighborhoods than any other demographic group, including American Indians, who lie just below, at 31 percent; Hispanics at 24 percent; Asian-Americans at 8 percent; and non-Hispanic whites at 5 percent.The negative consequences of living in high poverty neighborhoods are not only imposed on the poorest African-Americans, but also on African-Americans with earnings above the poverty line.According to data provided by Elizabeth Kneebone, a majority of African-Americans, 52.5 percent, live in communities where the poverty level exceeds 20 percent. Put another way, 44.8 percent of all non-poor African-Americans live in neighborhoods where the poverty rate exceeds 20 percent. In contrast, 8.1 percent of whites live in such neighborhoods.Despite the flaws of public housing, the lack of federally subsidized housing (and of subsidized housing vouchers) has contributed to an acute housing crisis for the nations poor.Federal housing officials explicitly acknowledge the devastating shortage of housing for the poor. On the Section 8 page of the HUD online website we are informed that the housing voucher programIn New York City, residents of public housing are 45.8 percent black, and the average household income for residents of public housing is $14,425. The number of families on the waiting list for public housing, 227,000  constituting half a million people  outstrips by far the total number of units, 178,900.This pattern is repeated across the country. In Chicago, in 2014, 282,000 individuals and families applied for public housing or housing vouchers during the four-week period in which applications were accepted. Those four weeks last November were the only open application period since 2010.In August 2010, in East Point, an Atlanta suburb, 60 people were hospitalized after fights broke out among the 30,000 people in line  some of whom had camped out for three days in sweltering heat  to get on a waiting list for 455 housing vouchers.In The Architecture of Segregation, a paper published in August 2015 by Paul Jargowsky, a professor of public policy at Rutgers, Jargowsky argues that the increasing concentration of African-Americans in high poverty neighborhoods is a significant factor driving the protests against police shootings in cities from Ferguson to Baltimore:What makes these trends explosive is that the expansion and continued existence of high-poverty ghettos and barrios is no accident, Jargowsky writes:Public officials  and the Democratic Party  have, in point of fact, failed to deliver housing, employment or education programs that convincingly remediate the problems of poor black families.Barbara Sard, vice president for housing policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, argued in an email to me thatThis is where politically initiated solutions should begin.The Democratic Party cannot continue to reap the electoral rewards of the black vote  or embark on a comprehensive revaluation of life at the bottom of the economic scale  without fundamentally reconceiving how it deals with the neighborhoods where many of its voters live.Steps to reduce the trouble caused by extremely poor neighborhoods include the assertive use of the existing housing voucher programs to move people into high opportunity communities, which have poverty rates of 10 percent or less.The existing voucher program could be expanded to cover many more than the 2.2 million low income families currently in the program.One problem with proposals like these is that many Democratic politicians view support for a genuine expansion of affordable housing for African-Americans as likely to have a negative impact  or at least to be perceived as having an negative impact  on white communities. They see the distribution of resources away from whites to blacks as a form of political suicide.Even in super-liberal, very Democratic Amherst, Mass.  Obama 12,316, Romney 1,872 in 2012  residents fought bitterly against a proposal to build 26 units of moderate income housing. Their decade-long, ultimately futile battle involved court cases, appeals, and $150,000 worth of legal costs, despite pro bono legal assistance, The Atlantic reported in June 2015.In another liberal city, Seattle  Obama 279,000, Romney 46,000  Mayor Ed Murray announced a major affordable housing initiative on July 13 last year that included a mandatory requirement that all new development include affordable housing.Then, on July 29, Murray did an about face. I will no longer pursue changes, he announced, that allow more types of housing in single-family zones. Politically, the blowback has been enormous. Its been hard for the mayor to talk about anything else, Alan Durning, a member of the committee that produced the housing initiative, told the Seattle Met.These developments suggest that African-Americans living in poor neighborhoods cannot rely on Democratic leaders to take the decisive steps needed to ameliorate the problem as long as the Democratic Party can take the black vote for granted.The question, then, is how long can Democratic Party leaders and candidates continue to rely on African-American voters before African-American voters take matters into their own hands  just as white working-class Republican voters have done this year.The advent of Trump may mask this situation for now, but unless the Democratic Party makes different deliberate policy choices  and devises a way to harness the sense of injury and injustice prevalent in many minority communities without President Obama at the top of the ticket  African-American voters may choose to abandon the ballot box or to back more radical dissidents, just as Republican rebels have done this year. For the American center-left, even a small group of defectors would have a disastrous effect."}
{"text": "MELA THIRUVENKATANATHAPURAM, India   A bare-chested priest sat cross-legged in the temple of this farming village on a recent morning and recited all 1,008 names of Vishnu, the Hindu god, in the hope of soon receiving good news from the White House.A junior priest sprinkled the idol, known as Balaji, with shredded tulsi leaves and rose-water. The subject of their prayers was Sri Srinivasan, an Indian-born judge on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia who is rumored to be a top contender for President Obama to nominate to the Supreme Court.In Washington, Judge Srinivasan is known as a brilliant lawyer, and  what may be more important this year  so difficult to pigeonhole ideologically that his current appointment passed a bitterly divided Senate 97-0.In Mela Thiruvenkatanathapuram, though, he is known as the grandson of a local schoolteacher and yarn merchant who drove an ox-cart and typically wore a traditional wraparound dhoti.Neighbors say Judge Srinivasans grandfather, Padmanabhan Iyer, was neither rich nor powerful, but his ability to commit scriptures to memory made him an object of awe: He was capable of chanting mantras for two hours without as much as glancing at a text. The family is Brahmin, members of Hinduisms highest caste, which was long associated with priesthood.Every morning, at 6:30 a.m., Padmanabhan lined up his six sons for a half-hour of chanting, said Shankara Lakshmi, a granddaughter. All grew up to occupy government posts, except the youngest, who was hired as a mathematics professor at the University of Kansas  and whose son, in turn, became an American judge who may soon ascend to the nations highest court.The prayers chanted by the grandfather have descended on the grandson, said Kulathu Srinivasan, 62, a distant cousin who organized a temple ceremony last month to appeal to the deities on the judges behalf.The cousins friend, Ganapathy Subramanian, a retired physics teacher, said the practice of chanting enhanced memory and cognition. These mantras, they are not created, he said. They are from the universe.It is one of the Indian rules of existence that ancestral villages matter. Despite the fact that Judge Srinivasan was born in northern India after his parents had left the village in Tamil Nadu State, and he emigrated to the United States as a boy, people here refer to him as our son.This week, as suspense around the nomination built, the temple priest found himself standing barefoot outside the sanctum giving a telephone interview to CNN. At another point, a man who gave his profession as drawing master came forward with a sheaf of temple sketches that he hoped to pass on to Mr. Srinivasan in honor of the occasion.Here, at the southern tip of India, from the village of Mela Thiruvenkatanathapuram, a very great man was born, the drawing master, Pon Vallinayagam, said with a flourish. This man is coming to the highest position of the greatest court. We, the people of the village, the people of India, we think it is a great honor.This village, pronounced MAY-la THEE-roo VEN-ka-ta NA-tha POO-ram, has a deserted feel, so quiet at midday that you could hear the squeak of a rusted hand-pump as a woman filled a bucket with water. The community emptied out during the second half of the 20th century, when many Brahmins left rural villages for cities in great numbers and entered modern professions. Many proved to be extraordinarily successful.These days, many of the Brahmins ancestral homes have collapsed in on themselves, and prayer is the villages most vibrant business. Prosperous Brahmin families return regularly to make donations to their family deities, among them the four-armed, copper-alloy figure called Lord Srinivasan. Such visits can be brought on by a crisis: One family donated a gold tongue to the temple because their child was unable to speak; a wealthy man whose family owns a Dubai-based shipping company made an emergency visit to ask for help when one of his cargo ships was caught in a cyclone, said V. Murali Srinivasan, a third-generation temple priest.The priest had a dreamy look as he thought through the events of the coming days. If Judge Srinivasan is named to the Supreme Court, he said, the village will be known throughout India.Outside the temple sat a farmer named Kanakaraj, who grows rice on a meager half-acre of land. He has been observing the unusual goings-on, and when asked what he knew about it, gave a sudden, dazzling smile.Our son in America, he is a judge, he said. I dont know about the family. But a judge  a judge is like a god."}
{"text": "Were the experts wrong about the benefits of trade for the American economy?The nations working class had another opportunity to demonstrate its political clout Tuesday, as primary voters went to the polls in Illinois and Ohio, Rust Belt states that have suffered intensely from the loss of good manufacturing jobs. Last week, the insurrection handed Michigans Democratic primary to Bernie Sanders while continuing to buoy the insurgent Republican candidacy of Donald Trump.Voters anger and frustration, driven in part by relentless globalization and technological change, may not propel either candidate to the presidency. But it is already having a big impact on Americas future, shaking a once-solid consensus that freer trade is, necessarily, a good thing.The economic populism of the presidential campaign has forced the recognition that expanded trade is a double-edged sword, wrote Jared Bernstein, former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.What seems most striking is that the angry working class  dismissed so often as myopic, unable to understand the economic trade-offs presented by trade  appears to have understood what the experts are only belatedly finding to be true: The benefits from trade to the American economy may not always justify its costs.In a recent study, three economists  David Autor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, David Dorn at the University of Zurich and Gordon Hanson at the University of California, San Diego  raised a profound challenge to all of us brought up to believe that economies quickly recover from trade shocks. In theory, a developed industrial country like the United States adjusts to import competition by moving workers into more advanced industries that can successfully compete in global markets.They examined the experience of American workers after China erupted onto world markets some two decades ago. The presumed adjustment, they concluded, never happened. Or at least hasnt happened yet. Wages remain low and unemployment high in the most affected local job markets. Nationally, there is no sign of offsetting job gains elsewhere in the economy. Whats more, they found that sagging wages in local labor markets exposed to Chinese competition reduced earnings by $213 per adult per year.In another study they wrote with Daron Acemoglu and Brendan Price from M.I.T., they estimated that rising Chinese imports from 1999 to 2011 cost up to 2.4 million American jobs.These results should cause us to rethink the short- and medium-run gains from trade, they argued. Having failed to anticipate how significant the dislocations from trade might be, it is incumbent on the literature to more convincingly estimate the gains from trade, such that the case for free trade is not based on the sway of theory alone, but on a foundation of evidence that illuminates who gains, who loses, by how much, and under what conditions.Global trade offers undeniable benefits. It helped pull hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty in a matter of a few decades, an unparalleled feat. It ensured Apple could benefit from Chinas ample supply of cheap labor. Consumers around the world gained better-priced, better-made goods.Still, though trade may be good for the country over all  after netting out winners and losers  the case for globalization based on the fact that it helps expand the economic pie by 3 percent becomes much weaker when it also changes the distribution of the slices by 50 percent, Mr. Autor argued. And that is especially true when the American political system has shown no interest in compensating those on the losing side.The impact of Chinas great leap into the market economy  which drew hundreds of millions of impoverished peasants into the manufacturing sector, mostly making goods for export to the United States and other wealthy nations  is waning. Chinas wages are rising fast. Its exports and economy are slowing.Trade with other parts of the world has not been as disruptive. For all the criticism of Nafta, most economists assess  its impact on American workers as modest. Trade flows with Mexico were smaller and more balanced than those with China. American manufacturing employment remained fairly stable in the years after Nafta came into force in 1994, plummeting only after China entered the World Trade Organization in 2001 and gained consistent access to markets in the United States.The Chinese export onslaught, however, left a scar on the American working class that has not healed. That disproportionate impact suggests Washington officialdom might do well to reassess its approach to future trade liberalization. Most important, it points to reconsidering how policy makers deal with trades distributional consequences.It doesnt mean walling off the United States from the rest of the world, but it does mean learning from the experience of other advanced nations that had a much healthier response to Chinas rise.Germany, for example, not only received a surge of Chinese imports, but also experienced an onslaught of imports from Eastern European countries after the collapse of the Soviet bloc. But it managed to maintain a more balanced trade because German manufacturers increased their exports to all these countries too, offsetting the job losses from import competition.Mr. Autor suggests that Americans low savings rate was a big part of the story, coupled with foreigners appetite for accumulating dollar assets, which helped keep American interest rates low and the dollar strong, in that way fueling a persistent trade deficit.But other factors were at work. Robert Gordon of Northwestern University suggested to me that Germanys highly skilled workers were harder to replace with cheaper Chinese labor, limiting though not totally eliminating outsourcing. Germanys stronger labor unions also put up more of a fight.Washington played its part, too. In their new book Concrete Economics (Harvard Business Review Press), Stephen S. Cohen and J. Bradford DeLong of the University of California, Berkeley suggest that ultimately, it was the fault of American policy choices.The United States might have leaned against Chinas export-led strategy, they argue, perhaps by insisting more forcefully that Beijing let its currency rise as its trade surplus swelled. It might have tried to foster the cutting-edge industries of the future, as government had done so many times before, encouraging the shift from textiles to jumbo jets and from toys to semiconductors.What Washington did, instead, was hitch the nations future to housing and finance. But Wall Street, instead of spreading prosperity, delivered the worst recession the world had seen since the 1930s. Even at best, they write, the transformation of banking and finance has produced nothing (or exceedingly little) of value.So where should policy makers go from here?There are no easy answers. Tearing up existing trade agreements and retreating behind high tariff barriers  as Mr. Trump, and perhaps Mr. Sanders, would have it  would be immensely unproductive. It would throw a wrench into the works of a wobbly world economy. And reneging on international treaties would vastly complicate the international coordination needed to combat climate change.But in any future trade liberalization  including the Obama administrations pending Trans-Pacific Partnership deal, if it is to go forward at all  policy makers must be much more careful about managing the costs. Mr. Autor suggests any further deals to increase trade should be gradual, to give much more time for exposed companies and their workers to retool and shift into other jobs and sectors.Perhaps most important, the new evidence from trade suggests American policy makers cannot continue to impose all the pain on the nations blue-collar workers if they are not going to provide a stronger safety net.That might have been justified if the distributional costs of trade were indeed small and short-lived. But now that we know they are big and persistent, it looks unconscionable."}

{"text": "OTTAWA   Viewed at just the right angle, and maybe with a bit of squinting  and perhaps a little imagination  the natural stone formation resembled a charging elephant, about 100 feet high and up to eight feet wide.Elephant Rock near Hopewell Cape, New Brunswick, was so well known and frequently photographed that it appeared on the provincial health care identification card.But like the Rockies and Gibraltar  as the Gershwins somewhat simplistically put it  its only made of clay, and on Monday about half of it collapsed.The event, as far as anyone knows, went unwitnessed.Elephant Rock, or at least what remains of it, is one of the 17 Hopewell Rocks in the Bay of Fundy that become whimsical formations at low tide.Yet despite its importance as a tourist attraction and a provincial symbol, some in New Brunswick see the demise of the elephant as inevitable as the melting of an ice palace after a winter carnival.To some degree, its the end of an era, said Nol Hamann, the property manager of the provincial park that includes the Hopewell Rocks.This particular rock was iconic because it was on the health card, so everyone in New Brunswick feels they have ownership of it, he said. But the rocks are always changing.While the most dramatic, Mondays collapse was not the first recent act of natural destruction visited upon Elephant Rock. In 1997, a protrusion that Mr. Hamann said resembled an elephants trunk snapped off.Like its neighbors, Elephant Rock is a mixture of sandstone and a soft rock known as Hopewell Conglomerate. The tides, which rise and fall 36 to 46 feet, helped create the rocks by carving them out of the shoreline and also play a role in their destruction.But Mr. Hamann said that major springtime collapses were the result of the same freeze-thaw cycle that creates potholes.And, he added, all of the formations are ultimately doomed.People get attached, and they dont like change, Mr. Hamann said. But the tide waits for no man or rock."}

{"text": "When the Obama administration unveiled a proposal in January 2015 to open the southeastern Atlantic coast to oil and gas drilling for the first time, environmental advocates were shocked and enraged  and the oil industry was delighted.The emotions were the same, just on opposite sides of the energy-environmental divide, when the Interior Department announced Tuesday that the administration was yanking Atlantic drilling off the table. And almost everyone was shocked.In the balance between business demands and environmental conservation, President Obama has shown clearly where he wants his legacy to lean. He has killed the Keystone XL pipeline, announced a moratorium on coal extraction from federal lands, and now, after first signaling that he would approve East Coast oil drilling, he has opted to keep the oil under the sea.Obama administration officials said Tuesday that the decision was driven by many factors, but two stood out: an organized outpouring of opposition from the mayors and municipal councils in more than 100 of the coastal communities in the four states that would be affected by the drilling, and concern from the Pentagon that oil and gas exploration could threaten activities around Virginias Naval Station Norfolk, the worlds largest naval base.We heard from many corners that now is not the time to offer oil and gas leasing off the Atlantic coast, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell said. When you factor in conflicts with national defense, economic activities such as fishing and tourism, and opposition from many local communities, it simply doesnt make sense to move forward with any lease sales in the coming five years.Republicans reacted angrily to the move. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said: President Obama is so intent on solidifying his radical climate legacy that he has backed out of his commitment to a large, bipartisan coalition of state leaders. These states simply want to explore their own energy potential, but the presidents reversal has disenfranchised them of this chance. This is a lost opportunity for new jobs and economic growth in these coastal states.But while Obama administration officials knew they would face an angry response to the move, they also benefited politically from another factor: The price of oil has plunged to near record lows, easing the public demand for fresh drilling.When developing the initial Atlantic drilling plan last year, Obama administration officials said they were chiefly listening to four people: Virginias Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, and Pat McCrory, Nikki R. Haley and Nathan Deal, the Republican governors of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia. The governors told Mr. Obama they wanted the drilling, and they were backed by majorities in their state legislatures and senators.That initial January 2015 proposal, reflecting the wishes of the coastal state governors, came as part of the Interior Departments mandated release of regular five-year plans governing the federally owned waters of the nations outer continental shelf.As they sought to revise and fine-tune the draft plan, the administration opened it for public comments. That tapped different voices in those states.Residents of coastal communities feared that drilling in the Atlantic would bring a repeat of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 men and sent millions of barrels of oil spewing onto beaches.Mayors of a handful of small coastal communities assembled to pass resolutions asking Mr. Obama to take the Atlantic out of the drilling plan, sending those resolutions to the Interior Department. Environmental advocates began to organize aggressively. One group, Oceana, contacted mayors up and down the coast, urging them to pass similar resolutions.We thought, maybe we could replicate this and scale it, said Jacqueline Savitz, a vice president of Oceana. And then we started seeing numbers like 30 resolutions and 50 resolutions.Eventually, more than 106 coastal cities and towns in the coastal states enacted similar resolutions. Oceana teamed with regional groups, including the Southern Environmental Law Center. The groups covered lawns and beaches with No to drilling signs, but focused their attention on pushing through municipal actions that would resonate in Washington. They also worked behind the scenes to coordinate several anti-drilling opinion pieces in local newspapers from Richmond to Charleston.In November 2015 and January 2016, Oceana arranged for several local coastal government and business leaders to travel to Washington to meet with White House officials, including Mr. Obamas top environmental policy adviser, Brian Deese, as well as with Abigail Hopper, the director of the Interior Departments Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. At the January meeting, Ms. Savitz presented the officials with a thick binder of the municipal resolutions, covered with a map highlighting all the towns that had passed those resolutions, dropping it on the desk with a thud.Frank Knapp, the president of the South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce, was at those meetings. It was clear that while they had heard from the governors, they hadnt heard from the smaller local groups, Mr. Knapp said. I talked to them about the threat to our tourist economy. In particular, Mr. Knapp stressed to the officials that even the process of seismic testing, which uses blasts of sound underwater to determine whether there was oil and gas, could distress coastal residents.Outside of those meetings, Ms. Hopper was traveling the region, asking for resident input in dozens of meetings.The Pentagon submitted a report to the Interior Department laying out concerns with offshore drilling in the Atlantic. The report noted that off the coast of Norfolk naval base, the military conducts highly sensitive operations, including the use of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and live ordnance testing. The report did not call on the administration to ban the drilling, but it noted the sensitivity of conducting drilling in the vicinity of military activities. It was the combination of those factors, more than any others, administration officials say, that led to Tuesdays decision.The Republican governors were not assuaged. President Obamas total reversal can only be described as a special political favor to far-left activists, Mr. McCrory said in a statement.In South Carolina, Ms. Haley, speaking at a news conference, said the administration had turned around to pull the rug out from under us.In Virginia, Mr. McAuliffe suggested that there would be a way to move forward with the drilling after reassuring the Pentagon. Todays announcement is an opportunity to work with the Department of Defense to address the concerns they have raised, and to ensure that any offshore energy exploration is coupled with a revenue-sharing agreement that benefits our Commonwealth, he said in a statement."}
{"text": "Hong Kong politics has not traditionally been an arena for teenagers. But in 2012, students as young as 15 turned out to protest a plan for a national education curriculum, calling it an attempt at brainwashing by Beijing in the semiautonomous Chinese territory. Then, in 2014, student-led demonstrators occupied large parts of central Hong Kong to press for greater popular participation in the election of the territorys leader. This year, teenagers as young as 14 were among those detained when a protest against what they said was the authorities crackdown on street hawkers  seen as emblematic of local culture  escalated into the worst rioting in Hong Kong in half a century.Now, some of them, like Joshua Wong, 19, are forming their own parties to contest elections in September for a legislature that is dominated by politicians more than twice their age. Among their shared grievances are economic inequality and the slow pace of democratic change, and a concern that Hong Kong  a former British colony that was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a one country, two systems pledge that its civil liberties and way of life would be preserved for 50 years  is losing its distinctive culture and identity as integration with China moves forward.In March 2015, the Hong Kong government appointed Lau Ming-wai, 35, as chairman of the Commission on Youth, an advisory body on youth development that also sponsors exchange trips to mainland China and internships with Chinese companies. A former employee of Goldman Sachs with a doctoral degree in law, in 2014 Mr. Lau took over as chairman of the property developer Chinese Estates Holdings from his billionaire father, Joseph Lau, who was convicted of bribery in Macau. In an interview, he discussed the roots of discontent, balancing local identity and integration with China and the most powerful way to effect political change:Q. Why are so many young people protesting?A. Several reasons. The short answer is that a lot of young people dont feel they are adequately represented by older politicians.Q. What economic, social and political developments in Hong Kong of the past few years could be contributing to this?A. In Hong Kong, young people have a real issue with education and jobs. The value of a university degree has depreciated, because now everyone and their mother has one. The expected salary one can get from holding a degree has come down or stayed the same in nominal terms for the last 10 years.The other one is 43 percent of young people are employed in sectors that we consider as not having that much mobility in terms of wage mobility, including logistics, food and beverages, retail and hotel. That itself is frustrating. Of course, if you add that into [the cost of] housing  in the last five years it has gone nowhere but up.Are these the reasons why our young people are out on the street? If you speak to the democracy activists in Hong Kong, theyll say these are hardly the reasons. Theyll say you can solve the job, education, housing issues all you want, but it would not reduce their desire to go after democracy. I fully appreciate that, and Ive said this in the past: Solving the economic side of things isnt going to reduce the yearning for democracy. Equally, solving democracy will not solve your jobs, housing and education issues.Q. Over the Chinese New Year holiday, a protest claiming to defend street hawkers at Mong Kok led by Hong Kong Indigenous, a group advocating resistance to mainland Chinese influence, turned into a riot, with hundreds of young protesters displaying a level of violence unseen in decades. What does this say about young peoples frustrations?A. It was mostly anger directed at the authorities, namely the police. For me, I cant relate the riot with the general despair that young people in Hong Kong might face. To go from general dissatisfaction with the government or older politicians to throwing bricks at the police requires a great deal of radicalization.Q. All of Hong Kongs university student unions issued statements sympathizing with the Mong Kok protesters, who were called mobs by the government. And a week after the protest, a leader of Hong Kong Indigenous, Edward Leung, received 15 percent of the vote  more than 60,000 votes  in a by-election for the legislature. It was a surprisingly strong showing, even if he didnt win. What might explain the support these radicals seem to have received?A. Some segments of young people are very disillusioned with the political process. A lot of people feel their voices are inadequately represented by their politicians. I say to young people whenever I get a chance: The ballot box, rather than riots or sit-ins, is your best chance to actually cause a political earthquake.Why? Look at the turnout rates for all our elections. Were 47 percent at the district elections. Fifty-three percent of voters were sitting at home watching television. Im sure there are young people among those sitting at home, and that is the single biggest reason why we havent seen a political earthquake in Hong Kong.Q. According to polls, fewer people in Hong Kong are identifying themselves as Chinese, as opposed to Hong Kong people. The decline is especially sharp among younger respondents. Some say they fear that integration with the mainland threatens their liberties and culture. How can the government persuade them to love, rather than fear, China?A. First of all, society and governments need to acknowledge that Hong Kong has a unique history, unique identity, unique culture, that are different from those of mainland China. The fundamental premise of any sort of winning hearts and minds is we have to acknowledge that these differences are real. In fact, I dont know simplified characters. Im almost illiterate when I go north.My point is this integration with China takes places across many levels  economic, social, cultural and so forth. The social and cultural integration issues were seeing, in my opinion, are man-made. No one is forcing us to speak Mandarin. No one is forcing us to read simplified Chinese. You can be proud of your Hong Kong identity and culture and at the same time accept and embrace mainland Chinese identity and culture. Embracing doesnt mean turning yourself into it. It just means unclenching your fists.Q. In January, the Chinese Communist Party issued a directive calling for measures to foster patriotism in young people nationwide, including in Hong Kong. It proposed more cross-border exchange programs, exam-free admission for Hong Kong students to mainland primary and secondary schools and the establishment of a standard test for competence in Mandarin for Hong Kong residents. Do you support these proposals?A. I agree with the ultimate aim, and I actually agree with most of the methods. But theres a disconnect there. To think that to go on a couple of mainland tours or to promote a common language and so forth can instantly translate into patriotism is wishful thinking. A lot of the stuff were doing  those tours, internships  were trying to let young people build an understanding. If you want to fall in love, the choice is yours.Young people currently lack a good enough understanding and appreciation of China, so to talk about patriotism so quickly is one step too early."}
{"text": "CLEVELAND  Energized by his first primary victory, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio argued on Wednesday that he was the only candidate in the Republican field who could actually defeat the Democratic nominee in November.Let me tell you, neither Cruz nor Trump can win the general election, Mr. Kasich said on NBCs Today show, referring to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Donald J. Trump.You know, they cant come into Ohio with the philosophies they have and win, Mr. Kasich added. If you cant win Ohio, you cant be president.Mr. Kasich kept his campaign alive by winning his home state on Tuesday, gaining 47 percent of the vote, compared with about 36 percent for Mr. Trump. When he gave his victory speech, he stood in front of a video screen that said, As Ohio goes, so goes the nation.No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio in the general election. Mr. Kasich, who has been a notably moderate voice in the Republican field, likes to highlight his strength in a hypothetical matchup against Hillary Clinton, as several national polls have found him with an edge against Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Cruz and Mrs. Clinton have been roughly even in polls, while Mrs. Clinton has generally led in matchups with Mr. Trump.In the Today interview, Mr. Kasich said that by prevailing in Ohios winner-take-all contest, in which he gained 66 delegates, he dealt Mr. Trump a very, very big blow as the New York billionaire tries to win enough delegates to secure the Republican nomination.Mr. Kasich, who planned to campaign in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, said no candidate would win enough delegates to secure the nomination before the convention, which will be held in Cleveland in July. And he took a moment to bask in his victory.I beat Trump by 11 points, he said. I mean, thats pretty remarkable, isnt it? He lived in Ohio, he came in here, he trashed me and he lost."}
{"text": "For the second time in a matter of days, federal agents on Tuesday seized what they described as an illicit antiquity, valued at several hundred thousand dollars, and scheduled to be sold during New Yorks Asia Week, a celebration of Asian art that includes museum exhibitions and sales by dealers and auction houses.Officials with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations said in a statement that they had confiscated a second century bodhisattva schist head from the Gandhara civilization and likely looted from a region that is now part of Pakistan.But they provided few other details about the seizure, including where it had taken place, except to say that the head had been intercepted at a port in the New York area. The statement said that the head was in transit to an East Coast auction house.On Friday, federal agents seized two sculptures from Christies in Midtown Manhattan, both of which were characterized as looted and both of which were scheduled to have been sold this week.Christies said it had not known of any problems with the items and that it was cooperating with investigators.Investigators have been able to identify that artifacts like this often take very circuitous routes through Asia, where they are entered into the shipping stream at very high volume ports, the agency said in its statement. This is often done to help hide the goods. This can make finding a smuggled artifact among thousands of licit shipments kind of like finding a needle in a haystack.The statement did not identify what methods the investigators had used to track the seized item, a head that had been once been part of a larger statue.It is a common practice for looters to remove just the head of a sculpture in situ because it is easier to smuggle and sell on the black market, the statement said.Officials say they have been on the lookout for shipments destined for Asia Week, and that the cargo containing the bodhisattva had some of the red flags authorities look for, including false documentation."}
{"text": "OSLO   He lives in a three-room suite with windows, about 340 square feet, that includes a treadmill, a fridge, a DVD player, a Sony PlayStation and a desk with a typewriter. He has been taking distance-learning courses at his countrys main university. He has access to television, radio and newspapers. He prepares his own food, and he entered the Christmas gingerbread-house baking contest at his prison.Anders Behring Breivik, the Norwegian extremist who was convicted of killing 77 people in a bomb and gun rampage in 2011, returned to court on Tuesday to pursue his claim that his solitary confinement  albeit in cushy circumstances  violates his human rights.The hearing, at which Mr. Breivik gave a Nazi-style salute, has been accompanied by a new round of grief and outrage over the attacks, the deadliest violence in Norway since World War II.Mr. Breivik, 37, was convicted of terrorism in 2012 and sentenced to 21 years in prison, though he can be held for longer if he is deemed a threat to society.His case has strained Norways commitment to tolerance and compassion, which includes a penal system that strongly emphasizes rehabilitation over punishment.Since 2013, Mr. Breivik has been held in isolation at Skien, a high-security prison in southern Norway, after being transferred from Ila prison, outside Oslo.Mr. Breivik has been complaining about his confinement since 2012 and at one point threatened to go on a hunger strike. Now he has sued the government, arguing that under the European Convention on Human Rights, long-term solitary confinement amounts to torture.He is not permitted to communicate with other prisoners and has limited phone access. All of his letters, coming and going, are monitored and subject to censorship. He is allowed to spend one hour outside each day.He is not allowed to leave the prison, and he could not attend his mothers funeral in 2013. He has also asserted that he has been subjected to degrading treatment, including hundreds of strip searches and frequent searches of his cell, including at night.For security reasons, the proceedings, which are scheduled to last through Friday, are being held at the prison and are not being televised.The prisons director, Ole Borlaug, told reporters that security for the case would be like an airport. The hearing is being held in the prisons gymnasium; the judge, Helen Andenaes Sekulic of the Oslo District Court, is using the prisons chapel as her office. Most journalists following the case are doing so via closed-circuit television transmission to the courthouse in Oslo.This case is not, as many believe, a case being run in order to get Breivik back into the limelight, Mr. Breiviks lawyer, Oystein Storrvik, told the court on Tuesday. This is a case to determine the conditions for the remainder of his imprisonment.The Norwegian Constitution prohibits capital punishment, but Mr. Storrvik has argued that solitary confinement can be even worse than a death sentence.It is a big responsibility a state takes upon it when it chooses not to use capital punishment, he told the court.Mr. Breivik did not speak at the hearing. He mostly stared at the stacks of documents in front of him while his lawyer spoke. Behind him were four uniformed security officers.Marius Emberland, a lawyer for the government, said the conditions of Mr. Breiviks confinement were justified in light of the gravity of his crime, the risk of flight and the continuing threat he poses as a terrorist. He also noted that at least one other inmate had threatened Mr. Breivik.Breivik is quite simply a very dangerous man, Mr. Emberland said, adding that Mr. Breivik had shown no sign of remorse.Another government lawyer, Adele Matheson Mestad, told the judge that censorship of Mr. Breiviks correspondence was necessary to stop him from encouraging other extremists.The massacre on July 22, 2011, began with a car bombing at a government building in Oslo that killed eight people, followed by the fatal shootings of 69 others at a Norwegian Labor Party youth retreat on the island of Utoya.In a manifesto he drafted before the massacre, Mr. Breivik spoke of inciting a civil war in Europe and cited his animosity toward Muslims.In interviews in Oslo, relatives of the victims condemned Mr. Breivik but expressed respect for the countrys justice system.He murdered our children, and now he is suing the state for the terms of his imprisonment, said Lisbeth Kristine Royneland, 51, whose daughter Synne, 18, was killed at Utoya, and who is now a spokeswoman for families of the victims.But we understand that the trial is necessary, she said. Many of the families are today avoiding reading or watching the case in the media. Apart from myself, I only know two other parents who will be here today.Ms. Royneland added: What I fear most today is that he gets a venue to spread his extreme-right message; that is what I hope to avoid. He is building a network, so that is what we fear. I hope he does not win the case.Bjorn Ihler, 24, a Utoya survivor who followed the proceedings from the courthouse in Oslo, said that he had devoted himself since the attack to fighting extremism, and that he was enrolled in a masters program in peace and conflict studies.Mr. Ihler has been credited with having saved the lives of two boys, ages 8 and 9 at the time. (Mr. Breivik shot at Mr. Ihler but missed.)In 2012, I had to amass power to confront the Breivik I had imagined in my head, the monster Breivik, Mr. Ihler said, recalling the trial. But what I saw was just the man Breivik, small and weak. He is still just the man Breivik, only now older and with less hair.He said he had no emotions about seeing Mr. Breivik again, not even about the Nazi-style salute.I think its important that we give him this trial, Mr. Ihler said. It is a victory in itself for us, as a society, not for him. Even terrorists have human rights. We have to keep in mind, though, that even though he is just one man, he represents an idea that we need to combat.Eight witnesses, including psychiatric experts, prison officials and a government ombudsman, are scheduled to testify in the proceedings.Norwegian politics have shifted to the right since Mr. Breiviks conviction. In 2013, a conservative-led alliance came into power, replacing a previous coalition of social democrats and environmentalists. The Progress Party, a right-wing party that opposes immigration and seeks to reduce taxes, and of which Mr. Breivik was a member for a number of years, is part of the new coalition."}
{"text": "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.  Saying that a sex video featuring the former professional wrestler Hulk Hogan was newsworthy, Nick Denton, the founder and chief executive of Gawker Media, defended his websites decision to publish it as he testified in a $100 million invasion-of-privacy lawsuit here on Tuesday.I think it stands on its own, Mr. Denton said, and stands up to the test of time. Referring to Albert J. Daulerio, the former editor in chief of Gawker who published the video and wrote the accompanying commentary, Mr. Denton said: He made a contrast between an American icon and the man behind that American icon. I think it was of newsworthy interest to the sites readers.The 1-minute 41-second video is at the heart of the suit by Hulk Hogan, who claims that Gawker violated his right to privacy by posting it in 2012. The former wrestler, whose legal name is Terry G. Bollea, is suing Gawker, Mr. Denton and Mr. Daulerio in a case being heard before six jurors in Pinellas County Court.Gawker contends that Mr. Bollea made his sex life fair game by talking about it candidly in public, including on Howard Sterns radio show.Mr. Denton faced pointed questioning under cross-examination as Kenneth Turkel, a lawyer for Mr. Bollea, tried to show that Mr. Denton had contradicted himself in statements about his journalistic standards.Lets talk, for a lack of a better word, about your philosophy at Gawker, Mr. Turkel said.Mr. Denton said: I think most stories tend to be true. I think we tend to have high standards.Oh, really? Mr. Turkel fired back, directing a technician to show an enlarged image of a June 22, 2009, Washington Post interview with Mr. Denton, in which the Gawker founder said that it was not part of the mission statement at Gawker to do good.The atmosphere turned uneasy in the courtroom when Mr. Turkel asked Mr. Denton to read aloud sexually explicit excerpts from the commentary written by Mr. Daulerio that accompanied the video. Under questioning, Mr. Denton had referred to Mr. Daulerios text as gentle and sweet.In making the contrast, Mr. Turkel was trying to convince jurors that the sexually descriptive text was much more raunchy than sweet.Mr. Denton remained composed through the process, and injected some humor into an exchange about his marriage.Mr. Turkel tried to turn Mr. Dentons philosophy of transparency against him, asking why he had guests give up their cellphones at his wedding. The suggestion was that Mr. Denton was being hypocritical about a public figures right to privacy.We didnt want images to show up on social media, Mr. Denton acknowledged.But while he and his husband, Derrence Washington, did not want anyone to post pictures, he said, we didnt sue people, drawing soft laughter from some in the courtroom.Lawyers for Gawker will most likely appeal any decision against them. If Gawker wins, it could set a powerful precedent for online publishers."}
{"text": "Hikaru Nakamura grew up in White Plains, with a celebrated chess teacher for a stepfather. Fabiano Caruana grew up in Park Slope, where he attended the Berkeley Carroll School and learned to play chess at Congregation Beth Elohim at the age of 5. Both now in their 20s, both home-schooled after the primary grades, they are phenoms of the sort that New York seems to produce with some regularity, and what they do phenomenally well is play chess.Mr. Nakamura at age 15 became the youngest American grandmaster ever, until Mr. Caruana earned the title at 14.Now they are vying to return to the city for the biggest match of their lives.For the first time since 1995, when it was held on the 107th floor of the World Trade Center, the world chess championship is scheduled to take place in New York in November, and there is a chance that one of these two masters will be challenging for the title. If either were to win, he would be the first American since Bobby Fischer to achieve that goal, after a drought of more than four decades.It is exceedingly rare for a single American to make it this far, let alone two.In the chess world, this is huge, said Bryan Quick, executive director of the century-old Marshall Chess Club on West 10th Street, where both contenders played tournaments when they were younger. It shows that U.S. chess is on an upswing.It will be a changed game in a city that has changed around it.Some of those changes are on display right now in Moscow, where eight of the worlds best players, including Mr. Nakamura and Mr. Caruana, are competing for the chance to challenge the current champion, Magnus Carlsen, in New York in November.The two Americans  neither lives in New York anymore  faced off in the first round of the tournament, displaying their different styles. Mr. Nakamura, 28, began aggressively, taking an early advantage. Mr. Caruana, 23, coolly worked out a draw.What was more revelatory, at least for the uninitiated, was what happened next.Minutes after the game ended, the two stared into matching laptops, analyzing the what-ifs. What if Mr. Nakamura had moved his rook there? Or there? With each move, the computers scanned databases and fed back the likelihood of positive outcomes. The two grandmasters, in turn, deferred to the higher authority.Mr. Nakamura frowned at an unmade move that, according to the computer, might have enabled him to press his advantage. Here was the point at which human genius diverged from machine.O.K., weve seen the computer evaluation, so we see its very good, he said of the move. But over the board its very hard to play a move like that.The rise of big data has changed the way chess is played and the way it is taught, to the dismay of some who remember the days before Garry Kasparov lost to IBMs Deep Blue in 1997. These days, the phone in your pocket can beat the very best chess player on earth.Its removed some of the poetry of it, said Bruce Pandolfini, a celebrated chess instructor who taught Fabiano Caruana from age 5 to age 7. Chess instills in you to work with a plan. Computers dont do that. They dont suggest plans. They just tell you whats the right move.When he discusses strategies with students, Mr. Pandolfini said, their parents are often looking into phones, then declaring what the right move should be.Frank Brady, president emeritus of the Marshall Chess Club, said he worried that computers rob some of the grace of the game.Theres something about someone figuring out the moves, a charm and excitement for someone who is not booked up, Mr. Brady said.He added, If youre not computer savvy, youre at a disadvantage. And these little kids who come along are into it tenfold.For players at the level of Mr. Nakamura and Mr. Caruana, this means scouring databases to study their opponents preferred openings and the moves that the computer says are most likely to prevail against them. Their seconds are often computer specialists.Mr. Nakamura, speaking by Skype from Moscow before the start of the tournament, said that computers had created a generational difference among chess players. At 28, he said, he is old enough to remember the days before computers were better than human players, but young enough to have made his mark in the computer age.If you talk to some of the older players, they definitely say they see beauty in certain games, he said. In my case, there are certain times when I think, Wow, thats so amazing, chess is so full of ideas. But most of the time I tend to be much more pragmatic about it, as opposed to thinking about it as art or something exquisite.He recalled an unhappy experience in 2011 while training with Garry Kasparov, who successfully defended his championship in 1995 at the World Trade Center, and whom many consider the greatest chess player of all. There were a lot of times when his understanding of chess from when he grew up, his intuition, or feel, was simply wrong according to the computer, Mr. Nakamura said. It showed how much different chess is now. Because computers are the ultimate authority. You just automatically accept what they say, and you move on.But if there is less poetry at the highest levels of chess these days, the game is enjoying a resurgence in New York, after a lull that saw the Manhattan Chess Club close in 2002 after 125 years. And much of the boom is driven by very young players who learn the game at school. At the Success Academy charter school network, every student takes mandatory chess training as part of the curriculum  not as an after-school activity  from kindergarten to fourth grade. This year that comes to about 9,000 students. Public schools have also increased their chess programs; a nonprofit called Chess in the Schools runs programs in 50 elementary and middle schools, serving about 13,000 low-income students.It gets kids to fall in love with thinking, said Sean OHanlon, who designed the Success Academy chess curriculum.At Intermediate School 318 in Williamsburg, which regularly produces championship boys and girls teams, chess is as popular as basketball, the principal, Eric Windley, said. And basketball is very popular, he added.None of this means that there is a New York style of chess, said Sunil Weeramantry, the executive director of the National Scholastic Chess Foundation (and Mr. Nakamuras stepfather), but it means that young players in New York have steady opportunities to compete. A third of the players in any national tournament will come from the tristate area, Mr. Weeramantry said.In his own home, the top contender was supposed to be Hikarus older brother, Asuka, who was national champion for six years. Then Hikaru surpassed him. That had the effect of making Asuka pull away, Mr. Weeramantry said. I felt guilty. He kept everything to himself. He didnt let on that this bothered him, but one day it all came out: Im older than him; Im smarter than him; why cant I beat him? He plays for recreation now, and works at JPMorgan. Mr. Weeramantry said he recognized that Hikaru had the temperament to excel when his younger son suffered a terrible loss in Spain, and he bounced back the next day.In the early rounds in Moscow, through Thursday, Mr. Caruana had a series of draws that left him in the middle of the pack, within reach of the leaders. Mr. Nakamura lost two of his first six games, greatly diminishing his chances. The 14-round tournament ends March 29.The outcome could determine the shape and scope of the showdown in New York; the venue, the excitement level, the embrace of the city that helped produce two of the contenders. Mr. Quick of the Marshall Chess Club said he hoped the presence of an American challenger might help recapture the mania that followed Mr. Fischers rise in the 1970s. The championship match in Reykjavik in 1972, which stood as a proxy battle between the United States and the Soviet Union, was broadcast live on national television and landed Mr. Fischer on the covers of Time and Life.The country changed after Mr. Fischers Cold War triumph over Boris Spassky, said Miron Sher, a Russian-born grandmaster who lives in Brooklyn and coached Mr. Caruana from 1999 to 2004. It could be like that now, especially if an American wins, he said. We have to prepare people for it."}
{"text": "The worlds largest coal company, the Peabody Energy Corporation, warned on Wednesday that it might have to file for bankruptcy protection as it struggles to keep up with its debt payments.In a securities filing, Peabody said waning demand for coal around the world and stiffer regulations had raised substantial doubt about whether the company could continue to operate outside bankruptcy.Analysts have been warning for months that Peabody could follow the nations other large coal companies, like Arch Coal, Alpha Natural Resources and the Patriot Coal Corporation, into bankruptcy. The United States coal industry has been pummeled by tighter regulations and competition from cheaper sources of fuel, mostly notably natural gas.Peabody, which owns and operates coal mines across the United States and Australia, has been trying for weeks to negotiate a deal with its creditors to ease some of its debt payments. But those talks have failed to produce a deal, leaving Peabody with few options outside a bankruptcy filing, analysts say.Based in St. Louis, Peabody traces its history to 1883, when coal was becoming the nations dominant energy source. It expanded into Australia in 2011 with the purchase of two coal companies there.The coal industry has been struggling for many years, but its problems have intensified recently with the slowdown in the demand from the emerging markets and the slump in natural gas prices in the United States.With revenue falling and debt costs rising, coal companies, which are large employers in parts of West Virginia, Wyoming and Utah, have been scrambling to stay solvent.Peabody said that last month it reached the limit on its revolving credit line, borrowing the maximum of $945 million.Peabody said it would not make roughly $71 million of interest payments that were due on Wednesday. The company has a 30-day grace period to either make the payment or be found in default.Lenders to the coal industry are taking staggering losses on their investments. Some debt is trading at just pennies on the dollar.Peabodys shares, which have been trending up in recent weeks on hopes that the company might be able to sell some assets and reach a deal with creditors, fell as much as 43 percent on Wednesday."}

{"text": "MOSCOW  President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday warned against politicizing the doping scandal that has touched a number of Russian athletes, and he criticized his nations sports officials for failing to take the issue seriously.It is clear that our sports officials failed to realize the importance of these questions, Mr. Putin said at a government meeting in the Kremlin.Several prominent Russian athletes, including the tennis star Maria Sharapova and Semion Elistratov, an Olympic gold medalist in speedskating, have recently tested positive for the banned drug meldonium. The drug is produced in Latvia, a former Soviet state, and is commonly used across Eastern Europe to enhance the hearts oxygen intake and blood flow. The World Anti-Doping Agency banned it on Jan. 1.In November, the agency published a report containing allegations of state-sponsored doping and mass corruption in Russian athletics, prompting the International Association of Athletics Federations to provisionally suspend Russia.Some pro-government commentators suggested that Russia was being singled out to punish it for its active foreign policy. But Mr. Putin swept aside such conjecture.We should not put forward any conspiracy theories  we should systematically and in a timely manner react to the decisions that are being made, including on the level of international organizations, Mr. Putin said, according to a transcript on the Kremlins website.It is obvious that our antidoping legislation needs serious improvement if we experience such failures, he said. I am asking the government to work on this and other issues to raise the effectiveness of the national fight against doping."}

Its boy choristers sang in the memorable performances of Bachs St. Matthew Passion that he led in 2014 at the Park Avenue Armory with the Berlin ensemble and the Berlin Radio Choir.

He will lead the St. Thomas Choir of Men and Boys and the Orchestra of St. Lukes in a program that will include Gabriel Faurs Requiem, The Lark Ascending by Ralph Vaughn Williams and Edward Elgars Serenade for Strings.The concert will also welcome Mr. Scotts successor, Daniel Hyde, who will play the organ. Thus, in one concert, we honor the memory of a great musician and begin a new chapter in the history of music at St. Thomas Church Fifth Avenue, the churchs rector, the Rev. Canon Carl F. Turner, said in a statement. Mr. Hyde is currently the master of the choristers of Magdalen College, Oxford, where, Mr. Turner noted, one of the singers happens to be a nephew of Mr. Rattle."}
{"text": "BERLIN   German authorities banned a neo-Nazi group known as the White Wolves Terrorcrew after the police conducted early morning raids on Wednesday in 10 of the countrys 16 states, confiscating weapons but making no arrests, the Interior Ministry said.Far-right parties have gained strength as Germany struggles to integrate more than one million migrants, and the ban is intended to demonstrate that the authorities will not tolerate agitation against foreigners and migrants, and certainly no violence, Interior Minister Thomas de Maizire said.This group is an association of neo-Nazis who openly and aggressively agitate against our state, against our society, against people who think differently, against migrants and against the police, he said.Mr. de Maizire said that the group wanted to build a dictatorship, and that its aim is supposed to be realized with all means available, including violence. He added that the core of the group was made up of about 25 people, with the leaders coming from Hamburg.The ministry said in a statement that no arrests were made on Wednesday, but that the authorities would continue to investigate at least 16 people connected to early morning raids. The seized items included a small-bore rifle, a crossbow, mobile phones, throwing stars, Tasers and Nazi memorabilia.The federal authorities rarely take such severe action, with a ban in January against a neo-Nazi web portal the first of its kind since nationwide restrictions were imposed on right-wing extremist groups in 2009 and 2011, according to the German news agency DPA.State authorities have banned nine different right-wing groups in seven different states since 2012, the news agency reported.Federal or state bans are issued on the basis of violations of laws governing associations in Germany. More than 100 groups have been banned since the laws allowing such restrictions took effect in 1964, with most of the bans targeting right-wing and foreign extremists."}
{"text": "James Purefoy and Michael Kenneth Williams, the stars of SundanceTVs new mystery-cum-buddy-comedy series Hap and Leonard, play an unusual pair: an East Texas good ol boy and his openly gay black best friend. The show is based on the work of the novelist Joe R. Lansdale, the author of several novels following Hap and Leonards adventures. Mr. Lansdales singularly bleak and raucously funny voice comes through clearly in developers Nick Damici and Jim Mickles adaptation. In a recent interview, Mr. Lansdale spoke about why Leonard is gay and what his life below the poverty line was like. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.The Hap and Leonard novels are all told from Haps point of view. Could you see the novels ever being told from Leonards perspective?I thought about that, but Hap is so close to who I am. He has a lot of the same background as I do: I grew up poor, I grew up in the country, and I did many of the [odd] jobs Hap and Leonard do, including cleaning brush, fields of potatoes, all that stuff. I also feel like, if I did tell the stories from Leonards perspective, I dont know how successful I would be. I love the idea of how Hap sees Leonard, not how Leonard sees himself.Leonard has doubts about his homosexuality because of his Baptist Christian upbringing. Hes not ashamed of his homosexuality, but he tells Hap that he hasnt quite made peace with it. Where does Leonards personality come from?Experience. A lot of gays dont fit stereotypes, and one of the reasons I wrote Leonard is I knew plenty of gay people that werent the funny neighbor next door. There are some [gay] people Ive met through martial arts who are some of the toughest people Ive ever known. Leonard is very confident about being gay, but there are times where  he doesnt think its wrong, but hes thinking its difficult. Times change, so hes no longer that unique for being gay.But when I created Leonard, there wasnt that many gay characters, and I thought that made him interesting. Hes putting the life on the line in Savage Season, which I wrote in the late 80s. When I wrote it, there were a number of gay murders across Texas. Some people thought the victims had it coming because they were gay  Well, its sad, but it is what it is.  even law people and judges were taking that position. I was furious. So that worked its way into the novel. I didnt set out to write a novel about those murders, but I always let myself flow with whats going on in my mind, and current events at the time.The gallows humor inherent in your stories seems to be a response to how bleak life is for people who live below the poverty line.I lived below the poverty line when I was young, and starting out as a writer. But my wife and I kept trying to do things better, as anyone with ambition does. But just because youre trying doesnt mean youre always going to succeed. You have to have a sense of humor for the same reason that policemen have to have a sense of humor: Youre dealing with darkness every day. As a poor person, youre dealing with your inability to pay your bills, counting pennies. Youre thinking Gee, I didnt want to eat a mayonnaise sandwich today, but thats what I can afford. And so on. Hap and Leonard have climbed upward financially a little since the beginning of the books. But theyre still not at a point that many would consider success. Ive always felt that if you pay your bills, and can take care of yourself without too much stress, then its a pretty damn good life."}
{"text": "ATLANTA   The Georgia General Assembly on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a proposal to strengthen legal protections for opponents of same-sex marriage, delivering a sudden victory for religious conservatives.The legislatures votes defied the wishes of many of Georgias most influential companies, as well as gay rights groups that said the bill would allow for lawful discrimination. Critics warned that the bill could provoke a backlash similar to what Indiana faced last year after officials there backed a measure that was also promoted as safeguarding religious liberty.Wednesdays votes in Georgia, which were scheduled abruptly and came after weeks of turmoil, do not ensure that the compromise bill will become law. Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, has previously voiced misgivings about legislation that could be perceived as intolerant. On Wednesday, Mr. Deals spokeswoman, Jen Talaber Ryan, said, The governor has been clear as to his position on this issue and will assess the legislation in April during bill review.The proposal declares that with few exceptions, the government may not substantially burden a persons exercise of religion even if the burden results from a law, rule, regulation, ordinance or resolution of general applicability. The language is similar to that in laws in effect at the federal level and in 21 states.The Georgia bill would also shield faith-based groups from penalties if, without violating voluntary agreements like contracts, they refuse to provide social, educational or charitable services that violate such faith-based organizations sincerely held religious belief. It would also protect such groups if they chose not to employ someone whose religious beliefs conflict with the organizations.When the Supreme Court changed the definition of marriage, dynamics changed, said State Senator Greg Kirk, a Republican. There was a need for a law, for this law, and it took Georgia to lead the way of the country to put this law together.The bill faced passionate opposition from figures like State Representative Karla Drenner, Georgias first openly gay legislator.This bill, she said, suggests that at my core, there is something offensive about who God made me to be."}
{"text": "Adding to the disarray in the current fashion world, Ennio Capasa, creative director of Costume National, and his brother, Carlo Capasa, its chief executive, announced on Tuesday that they were leaving the brand they founded 30 years ago.Today is for us a bittersweet time, as we end this extraordinary creative cycle, the Capasas said in a joint announcement.Costume National, which is based in Milan although it shows in Paris, rose to prominence by defining a certain cool minimalist style in the 1990s. Their signature look was the black trouser suit with a rock n roll edge. In recent years, the brand has struggled financially: After its former partner Ittierre declared bankruptcy, Costume National accepted another minority shareholder, the Asian investment firm Sequedge, in 2009. The deal included an option to buy out the Capasas after a certain time, which Sequedge exercised this year.Though Carlo Capasa said he and his brother had explored ways to raise enough money to buy out their partners, he added that they had not been successful. On Monday evening, they decided it would be better to leave than to become employees serving someone elses vision. The brothers had different ideas from their investor, he said, about retail growth and online strategy, among other issues. However, he added, there was no rancor in the parting.Indeed, unlike other such ruptures, in phone calls from Milan (Ennio) and Moscow (Carlo), the brothers sounded surprisingly upbeat about what had happened at their brand and what it meant for the future.Fashion is so different now than it was in the 1990s, it might be easier to start afresh than to try to update such specific codes as we had established, Carlo Capasa said. He will continue to hold his other job  president of the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, which promotes Italian fashion  and as a result, he was in Moscow for Fashion Week. They can be a bit of a prison. This way, Ennio will be much more free.His brother echoed those words, saying: Im sad  this has been the story of my life  but also full of the sense of possibility at the same time. I am ready for a new adventure.What form that adventure might take is not clear. Ennio Capasa said he would most likely take a few months to think and assess. But the Capasas have the rights to their names, and they are not subject to noncompete agreements.Fashion talks a lot about whether designers are even necessary, but I think more than ever, the world needs designers and clothes that have a soul, Ennio Capasa said, acknowledging that he was inclined to start another fashion brand.He leaves behind what he estimated to be a 50,000-piece archive at Costume National, so until the brand names another designer, the team has something to work with.On a more macro scale, Carlo Capasa said the upheaval that brands had experienced recently did seem to be something of a seasonal trend, given that Dior is also without a designer and that it is still unclear whether Hedi Slimane is staying at Saint Laurent.I was saying to Ennio the other day, maybe its the planets, he said. Their alignment is throwing everything off kilter.He was joking. Kind of."}
{"text": "You wonder how fashion designers keep up: fall, spring, resort, cruise, couture, pre-fall. All this while trying to navigate the shifting sands of the industry. Soon designers may be tasked with creating yet another collection  for Bitmoji. Some already are.Last fall, the popular app, which allows users to create a personalized emoji avatar, introduced runway looks to its virtual closet. Labels whose clothes were made available free through partnerships with Bergdorf Goodman and W magazine included Michael Kors, Zac Posen, Alexander McQueen, Calvin Klein and Diane von Furstenberg. Women can buy a wrap dress and outfit their pixilated selves in the same one.It was great news for Bitmoji fans, who were long stuck with basic T-shirts and drab monochrome dresses. Now their avatar can step out (on a runway, even) in a fur-trimmed parka paired with a miniskirt by Rodarte, even if they couldnt afford the ensemble in real life.But what about the designers whose carefully crafted wares were reduced to silly cartoons on a phone screen?Tanya Taylor, a Canadian designer whose vibrant print dresses are available on Bitmoji, said she had initial concerns about appearing too youthful or unserious. But she spoke to intelligent women she knew, many of whom use the app, and decided that Bitmoji is really a way to express fun and emotion.Ms. Taylor added: We have had such an incredible reaction and broadened the audience that knows about the brand. It shows were taking a risk and being playful.Designing for Bitmoji, however, was more complicated than she anticipated. She chose three past looks that exemplified her brand, including a best-selling (in real life) red-and-white knit top. Then she worked with Bitmojis programmers to digitize the clothes, a process that took almost three months.It honestly felt like we were going through actual fittings, Ms. Taylor said. They would send a PDF, and we would draw on the little avatars: Shorten the hem.As Bitmoji fans know, the avatars are pictured in hundreds of situations, and the clothes had to look wearable in each one. Ms. Taylor found that miniskirts work best (a lot of the scenarios, like a suggestion of coffee or mwah kiss, are not full body images), as do bright, punchy prints.So what outfits have been most popular on the app so far?In Bergdorfs fashion packet, Rodartes fur parka has been a winner, said Mallory Andrews, senior vice president for sales promotion, marketing and public relations for the retailer. That was interesting and exciting to see because the label is so fashion forward, she said.But Jacob Blackstock, the founder of Bitmoji, cited a very, very, very simple gray top by Joie as one of the most popular pieces over all.It speaks to the idea that for a lot of people, simplicity is their ideal, he said.As in real life, there are fewer Bitmoji fashion options for men: flannels, hoodies, T-shirts, a few black label suits and, for the edgier guy, a Kenzo lion-print sweater in three available colors.Mr. Blackstock wants to expand the mens offerings, but the limited wardrobe suits some users just fine. Jonathan Adler, the founder of the namesake home design company, is a big fan of the app (Before Bitmoji, I was living life in black and white, he said), and dresses his avatar as simply as himself.I just wear white jeans every day, usually with a blue shirt, he said. My Bitmoji used to have white jeans and a blue shirt. It was unmistakably moi.Around the holidays, Mr. Adler switched to a Hanukkah sweater with a Star of David.While some Bitmoji users switch outfits regularly (Ms. Taylor has workweek and weekend ensembles), Mr. Adler suggests men find a look that works and stick with it. And, he added, both sexes should create avatars that reflect (and dress) the way they really are.A persons level of honesty in their character is revealed by their Bitmoji, he said. I have a friend who Ive always felt was slightly narcissistic. Her Bitmoji makes her look like a supermodel. Its like a personal reckoning, being your avatar.Its that kind of insight into how consumers portray themselves through fashion that could turn Bitmoji into a valuable tool for designers. One can envision them previewing looks on the app, using it as a sales forecaster or even charging a tiny fee for the Bitmoji version of luxury goods that in real life would retail for thousands of dollars.We have three more outfits in the works, Ms. Taylor said.Before any of that happens, though, Mr. Blackstock and his team have to catch up. No new runway looks have debuted on the app since last fall, though he promised them soon, now that his programmers (So Busy, as the Bitmoji might say) are getting into a regular rhythm.It turns out even avatars cant keep up with the pace of fashion."}
{"text": "Tuesdays elections, with more than 14 million votes cast in five states, marked the more-than-halfway point in both parties presidential primary campaigns.Democrats and Republicans can now confidently predict which candidates will have the most delegates at their conventions in July: Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton each hold large and growing delegate leads. It would take an upset of staggering proportions for a rival to pull ahead of either one by the time the primaries end in June.But the two front-runners are not on equal footing. Mrs. Clinton has assembled a formidable majority coalition within the Democratic Party that has resisted Senator Bernie Sanderss appeals.Mr. Trump has achieved something less than that. He has locked down a large plurality of voters on the right, but not enough to guarantee that he will win a majority of Republican convention delegates. And his position appears to be weakening.These are some of our most important takeaways from Tuesdays voting:When presidential candidates get closer to their partys nomination, they often gain stature and appear more formidable as they approach the general election. For Mr. Trump, the opposite may be happening.He is winning, but at a terrible price. The intensifying attacks on his personal character and business record, and the scenes of violence at his rallies, appear to be taking a toll, exit polls show. In no state did a majority of Republican primary voters say they believed he was honest and trustworthy. In every state that voted on Tuesday except for Florida, about two in five Republicans said they would consider voting for a third-party candidate over Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton in November.With landslide wins in Florida and Ohio, Mrs. Clinton re-established herself as the prohibitive favorite in the Democratic race. Taking Ohio by double digits, she eased fears that Mr. Sanders might become a breakaway favorite across the Midwest after his upset victory in Michigan last week.There were no cracks in her base of support with black and Latino voters, or with older Democrats in general.And voters appear sympathetic to her criticism of Mr. Sanders as a candidate making fantastical promises: In every state on Tuesday, about three-quarters of Democratic primary voters said they considered Mrs. Clintons policy proposals realistic, putting her ahead of Mr. Sanders in that category by double digits in every state but Illinois.Gov. John Kasich of Ohio did something unprecedented for him on Tuesday night: He won a state. To be sure, it was the state that elected him to nine terms in Congress and two as governor  but still, it was a breakthrough of a kind.Winning Ohio, however, is valuable only if it helps spur a larger shift toward Mr. Kasich across the industrial Midwest. So far, he has little to show for all the attention he has lavished on the region. He finished third in Michigan last week and a distant third in Missouri on Tuesday. His best performance outside Ohio was pulling a fifth of the vote in Illinois  and again finishing third.Thats not a regional campaign. It is a one-state candidacy. The pressure is on Mr. Kasich to show he can do better.Mr. Sanders has a strong and durable political coalition, just not one that ultimately adds up to victory in a Democratic primary. Young people continue to support him  he won among voters under 45 in every state but Florida on Tuesday  as do white voters in most states. But Mr. Sanders would have needed to make deep inroads with nonwhites by now to have a strong shot at the nomination, and he has not.The calendar, however, is his friend: While the odds are powerfully against him, the next few rounds of voting will take place in states like Utah and Wisconsin, which resemble contests Mr. Sanders has won in the past.The most important dividing lines in the Republican coalition are income and education levels. Mr. Trump has consistently scored better with less-educated voters, and the elections on Tuesday were no exception: Even as he lost Ohio by 11 points, Mr. Trump won pluralities there of white voters who lack college degrees, and of Ohioans who earn less than $50,000 per year.In three states with close races  Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina  Mr. Trump won nearly half of voters without college degrees. But the best he managed with college graduates was a tie with Senator Ted Cruz in Illinois.If Mr. Trump became the nominee, Republicans might risk a large-scale defection by upscale whites who voted willingly for Mitt Romney four years ago."}
{"text": "As President Obama announced the nomination of Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, the debate over who should nominate a judge to fill the vacancy spilled onto the campaign trail, with presidential candidates from both parties digging in to their respective positions.Accusing their opponents of weakening an entire branch of government, Democrats pressed the point that a sitting president has the right, and the obligation, to fill openings on the bench. Republican hopefuls disagreed, and aggressively urged senators from their party not to cave to pressure from Democrats to hold hearings for Judge Garland.The debate is expected to continue into November, with the fragile balance of the court raising the stakes of the presidential election.Emboldened from his sweeping primary election victories on Tuesday, Donald J. Trump sided with mainstream Republicans on the issue of the nomination and urged Congress not to yield to the president.I think the next president should make the pick, and I think they shouldnt go forward, and I believe Im pretty much in line with what the Republicans are saying, Donald J. Trump told CNN on Wednesday morning.Mr. Trump said previously that he could understand Mr. Obamas desire to put forth a nominee but that he thought the Senate should still run out the clock on his term. The Republican front-runner claimed that even if the president nominated Mr. Trumps sister, a federal judge, hearings should not move forward this year.Certainly they could wait it out very easily, Mr. Trump said. I would be not in favor of going forward.Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was even more forceful in his opposition to Judge Garland, describing him as a false moderate who would reliably side with the courts liberal judges. He said that no vote should take place until a new president is installed.Make no mistake, if Garland were confirmed, he would side predictably with President Obama on critical issues such as undermining the Second Amendment, legalizing partial-birth abortion, and propping up overreaching bureaucratic agencies like the E.P.A and the I.R.S., Mr. Cruz said.At a town hall event in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said that he was not opposed on principle to presidents making such appointments during their final year in office. But because Mr. Obama has been so polarizing, it would be inappropriate for him to make the nomination, Mr. Kasich said.I didnt think the president should send anybody up now, because its not going to happen, Mr. Kasich said. Its just more division.But the Democrats hoping to succeed Mr. Obama claim it is their Republican rivals who are fostering division and playing politics with the court.My Republican colleagues have called Judge Garland a consensus nominee and said that there is no question he could be confirmed, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said. Refusing to hold hearings on the presidents nominee would be unprecedented.Mrs. Clinton, the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination, assailed Senate Republicans for dragging their feet on a nominee whom she said has impeccable credentials. She called the failure to give Mr. Obamas selection a fair hearing an act of constitutional malpractice.It is a serious obligation, performed on behalf of the American people, to ensure a highly qualified candidate fills a vacancy on the court, Mrs. Clinton said. That obligation does not depend on the party affiliation of a sitting president, nor does the Constitution make an exception to that duty in an election year."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON   Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will announce on Friday a corporate executive to lead his moonshot cancer initiative, selecting an expert who began work in 2003 to lower barriers between science and cures.Greg Simon, 64, who will be named executive director, took a job he may get to keep for only the last 10 months of the Obama administration. Mr. Simon, who is battling cancer himself, said he understood the urgency of the task.There are so many things in the cure process that take too long, he said.In June 2014, Mr. Simon received a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, a blood and bone marrow disease, and six months ago completed his first round of chemotherapy. He is now healthy, but while fighting the illness one of his close friends died, leaving two young children.The vice president has a chance to change the culture of science, Mr. Simon said. And if we can create new approaches that are a step away from the road scientists have long been traveling, in a year or two it will be a different road.Mr. Simon was an aide to Vice President Al Gore from 1991 to 1997, eventually leaving as his top domestic policy adviser to set up a lobbying and advisory firm. In 2003, he was lured by Michael R. Milken to start FasterCures, a charity intended to speed the translation between basic research and lifesaving medicines. In 2009, Mr. Simon left FasterCures to become senior vice president for patient engagement at Pfizer. He left Pfizer in 2012, and has been working since then as the chief executive of Poliwogg, a financial services company focused on investing in life sciences.With his amazing breadth of experience, both in the public and private sector, he will bring an invaluable knowledge of the health care landscape to the task force, Mr. Biden said in a statement.At FasterCures, Mr. Simon was a prominent voice for the potentially transformative effects of sequencing the human genome.In the lifetime of my generation, most of the diseases we are dealing with, if not cured, should be turned into treatable chronic diseases, Mr. Simon said in 2007, speaking of a notion that was widely held at the time but that most researchers now believe was wildly optimistic. But even then, Mr. Simon said that to achieve such breakthroughs, we have to have a new system.Mr. Simon has been critical of the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of Health, organizations where, he once said, curing disease is a byproduct of the system and not a goal. He will now have to work closely with both agencies, which have representatives on the task force. Mr. Biden, whose son Beau died from cancer last year, is the chairman of the initiative, which hopes to promote a decades worth of advances in cancer research in five years. But with just $195 million in new funding, the task force is considered an exceedingly modest effort.Mary Wooley, the president of ResearchAmerica, an advocacy group, said Mr. Simon had an unusual ability to bring together diverse groups of people to focus on a problem.Maybe with persistence, we can overcome the legacy systems and thinking that slow things down, Ms. Wooley said."}
{"text": "In the seven years since its founding, Asia Week New York has grown from a small promotional effort by a few Manhattan art galleries to a splashy, 10-day event that combines museum exhibitions with art dealing. Last year, organizers say, it led to $360 million in sales.But this year, Asia Week, which ends Saturday, has become the focal point of an aggressive and unusual law enforcement effort.Federal officials working with the Manhattan district attorneys office have seized on the festival to orchestrate a series of daily raids that have netted more than a half-dozen antiquities that the authorities say were looted overseas, then smuggled out for later sale by auction houses or dealers.For too long, those engaged in the criminal trade in antiquities have viewed the occasional seizure as simply the cost of doing business, said Matthew Bogdanos, the assistant Manhattan district attorney who obtained search warrants for the raids.But the seizures have upset dealers who say the sudden confiscations are a heavy-handed approach. Lark Mason, an Asian antiquities expert and dealer who is chairman of Asia Week, said gallery owners are ready to work with law enforcement when questions arise about objects.Why are they not approaching these galleries instead of treating them like criminals trying to do something underhanded, he said. The items seized this week were all publicized by their vendors online and in catalogs, he said, not sneaked in to be sold in some smoky back room.The seizures are part of Operation Hidden Idol, a nine-year investigation into antiquities smuggling that officials say has netted more than 2,600 items and reams of data about illicit trafficking. Typically, the authorities say, the smugglers create false paperwork to certify an object was acquired lawfully, often fooling purchasers and other dealers down the line.The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance, said the raids ensured that items could be confiscated and that alerting dealers beforehand might send the objects underground. Many seized items have been returned to their countries of origin, Mr. Vance added.Late Thursday, Homeland Security Investigations agents and the district attorneys office added to their tally of confiscations by seizing several items from the Nancy Wiener Gallery on East 74th Street, which specializes in Asian objects. Officials said they removed a limestone sculpture of Hindu deities valued at $35,000 and a bronze Buddha worth $850,000, as well as business records.Seizures cannot be good for the Asian antiquity market. But it is not clear what impact they are having this week on sales, gallery owners said. Many collectors are savvy and familiar with widespread reports about Subhash Kapoor, a former Manhattan dealer who is accused of having run the largest antiques smuggling operation ever uncovered in the United States.Mr. Kapoor primarily dealt in objects from South Asia  India, Pakistan and Afghanistan in particular  and those are the sorts of items that have been seized in the past week by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcements Homeland Security Investigations. There have been fewer reported instances of stolen antiquities from Japan, China or Korea turning up in the United States.Historically, Asian governments havent monitored their antiquities in the same way as nations like Italy, Greece, Turkey, and Egypt, said Leila A. Amineddoleh, the former director of the Lawyers Committee for Cultural Heritage Preservation. It makes them vulnerable.Mr. Kapoor, who is awaiting trial in India, has been the pivotal figure in Operation Hidden Idol, and the sheer volume of illicit artifacts he is said to have donated or sold  hundreds are in museums around the world  has raised questions about the level of scrutiny being practiced in both the art market and the museum world. Museums in the United States, Australia and Singapore, among others, have returned items obtained from Mr. Kapoor, many valued at well above $1 million. The Antiquities Coalition, which fights illicit antiquities trafficking, said major dealers and auction houses have the resources to conduct due diligence and should coordinate more with law enforcement and source countries.The burden of proof should fall on these global businesses, said Deborah M. Lehr, the coalitions founder, not on the individuals and countries who are victims of the illicit trade, to validate antiquities before any sale.Some experts say many problems would be solved if law enforcement shared information about suspect items rather than publicized eye-grabbing confiscations. The Committee for Cultural Policy, an advocacy group for collectors, has called for a digital system under which museums and collectors could document items publicly and address foreign claims in a neutral forum.Instead of allowing auction houses, art dealers or collectors to research pieces beforehand, authorities wait for them to be offered for sale and then seize them with great fanfare, said Kate Fitz Gibbon, a lawyer for the committee. The first anyone knows that an artwork is stolen is through a Homeland Security press release.This weeks seizures are far from the largest set of raids conducted by federal agents tracking illicit antiquities. In 2008, hundreds of federal agents swooped down on 13 locations in California with warrants for objects at institutions like the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Pacific Asia Museum in Pasadena.The bulk of the items were from Southeast Asia, and the man accused of directing the smuggling ring was convicted last year of making false declarations while importing antiquities.Cases that involve prosecution are rare, though, and penalties are often light. In one New York federal case, an antiquities dealer in 2012 admitted smuggling ancient coffins and funerary items worth $2.5 million into the United States using false documents. Though prosecutors asked that he be sentenced to at least four years in prison, the judge gave him 200 hours of community service and a fine of $200.Mr. Bogdanos and Mr. Vance said stern justice must be meted out to antiquities smugglers and to anyone in the trade who falsifies documents that accompany items.If you dont send that message, you dont deter others, Mr. Vance said. Antiquities raiding is not an acceptable business model."}
{"text": "The National Academy, the nations oldest continuously operating artists society, which has struggled in recent years to define its mission and to balance its budget, has decided to sell two Beaux-Arts buildings on Fifth Avenue at 89th Street that have been its home since 1942.The landmark mansions, formerly owned by the railroad heir Archer Huntington and his wife, Anna Hyatt Huntington, had become too expensive to maintain, and their huge market potential  they were appraised at $107 million in 2012  represented the best way for the academy to reinvent itself, in a new location, with an endowment, which it has never had, said Wendy Evans Joseph, vice president of the academys board.Its a big decision to come to, Ms. Joseph said in an interview Thursday. But for a lot of reasons, it seemed like a good idea. She added, Its about making a new history.The academy, which had its beginnings in a society founded in 1825 by a group of American artists including Thomas Cole, Rembrandt Peale and Asher B. Durand, came under withering criticism in 2008 when it sold two Hudson River School masterpieces, by Frederic Edwin Church and Sanford Robinson Gifford, at a time when it was facing debts that could have led to its closure.But the money raised, more than $13 million, was ultimately not enough to shore up the finances of the academy, which is run as a nonprofit and operates both a museum and a school. Ms. Joseph said that the institutions board saw no way out of a continuing budget deficit, despite the healthy tuition generated by the school. There was a sense that the costs were too great, she said.There are precedents for older New York institutions reviving themselves with such real-estate upheavals. In 2001, SculptureCenter, which had operated a school and artists studios in a carriage house on the Upper East Side since 1948, sold its Manhattan property to reinvent itself in an industrial space in Long Island City, Queens, where it has thrived as a contemporary art space.The National Academy, known for most of its existence as the National Academy of Design, has a collection of American painting and sculpture rivaling that of many larger museums, donated by famous members like Thomas Eakins, Winslow Homer and John Singer Sargent.For many years, it has struggled over whether to remain essentially a 19th-century-style club or to become a more conventional museum and show its collection to better effect. (The board has pledged never to sell more works to generate operating income or raise capital.)The academys museum will close in June until a new home is found. The school will operate for the foreseeable future in its home on East 89th Street, until that building is sold, the academy said.Ms. Joseph said the board had not yet thought about where the academy might relocate, though she mentioned the possibility of a little urban pioneering. The important result of the sale, she said, would be to establish a sizable unrestricted endowment that would give the academy, for the first time, the financial freedom to think more creatively about how to exist in the 21st century."}
{"text": "In a Soviet-looking courthouse in St. Petersburg, Fla., just a few blocks from the water, the wrestler Hulk Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, is taking on Gawker Media, its founder, Nick Denton, and the former editor of Gawker.com, Albert J. Daulerio. The case, which began on March 7, is a series of implausible and seemingly outlandish arguments, featuring a cast of characters that might have been assembled for a biting satire of celebrity and gossip culture. But buried under courtroom discussions of penis size and sex-tape mechanics are fascinating  and even important  issues of privacy, free speech and the very nature of news in the Internet era.The case centers on a video, apparently filmed about a decade ago, which shows Mr. Bollea having sex with Heather Clem, the wife of his best friend at the time, Todd Clem, a Florida radio shock-jock who legally changed his name to Bubba the Love Sponge. (We will decorously presume that a love sponge is some kind of romantic, perhaps heart-shaped, bathing aid.)In court, Mr. Bollea said he engaged in the encounter only because his marriage was falling apart and the two insisted that he have sex with Ms. Clem. I was depressed, he told the six-person jury in Pinellas County Circuit Court. I gave up and gave in. I felt that those people loved me.In 2012, Gawker was sent the video  stills from which had been published elsewhere  by an anonymous source, and it published a brief excerpt with an accompanying piece by Mr. Daulerio, then Gawkers editor. His post  and the layers of self-awareness mount up here  considered the fascination with celebrity sex tapes.Mr. Bollea had told Howard Stern that he slept with Ms. Clem with the blessing of her husband. Mr. Clem had also previously said publicly that Mr. Bollea was aware that the encounter was being filmed.Nevertheless, Mr. Bollea sued Mr. Clem in late 2012, based in part on the idea that he did not know he was being filmed. Mr. Clem later said that Mr. Bollea had not, in fact, known about the camera. Mr. Clem, according to a legal filing by Gawker, extricated himself from the lawsuit by promising to testify, to not disparage Mr. Bollea, and to not help us, and paid Mr. Bollea what was described as the substantial sum of $5,000.(Side note: Mr. Clem has been subpoenaed to testify in the trial, but is asserting his Fifth Amendment right to silence. The motion filed by his lawyer explains that this is because it may be argued by a party in this cause that Mr. Clem has given multiple statements on whether the plaintiff knew he was being taped while engaging in sexual conduct with Mr. Clems then wife, now ex-wife, Heather Clem. Should these statements prove to be differing, and we do not concede that they are, Mr. Clem could be subject to a state prosecution for perjury or a federal false statement prosecution.)For purposes of suing over the tape, that left Gawker, its founder Mr. Denton, and Mr. Daulerio. Gawker, which has a stated aim of publishing the kinds of salacious stories that reporters tell among themselves, rather than the sanitized versions Mr. Denton feels are usually presented, is sued quite regularly. But this time the sides failed to reach a settlement, and so the trial  in which Mr. Bollea is seeking $100 million in damages  commenced.Gawker argues that its decision to publish the excerpt is protected by the First Amendment. Further, it argues that Mr. Bollea often referred to his sexual exploits in public  in his autobiographies, with Mr. Stern, and on television  and so it is difficult for him to claim his privacy was infringed in this area.Mr. Bolleas lawyers have said that the video was not newsworthy, that its publication caused him emotional stress and harm and that Gawker posted it only for financial gain. Moreover, Mr. Bollea argues that Hulk Hogan, the character, made all those sexual boasts, not Mr. Bollea himself. And that Mr. Hogan, the character, is given to exaggeration and falsehood, which explains any contradictory statements he made about the tape and his knowledge of it. Mr. Hogan, he agrees, does not have much privacy left to violate. But Mr. Bollea does.Mr. Denton started Gawker in his living room more than a decade ago. It now encompasses more than 250 employees, across seven sites, dedicated to sports, feminism and gadgets among other things, most of which have a track record of producing controversial scoops.(They include obtaining a prerelease, new-model iPhone found in a bar, and revealing that the college football star Manti Teo had an imaginary girlfriend.)It has been majority-owned by Mr. Denton since its founding, and it took outside investment for the first time only recently, to secure funds for this case. In an interview last year, Mr. Denton put the chances of the case precipitating a disaster  that he would need to sell a controlling stake in the company to keep it afloat  at 1 in 10.In recent months, following another scandal, Mr. Denton had vowed to clean up the site  it is now heavily focused on politics. So a reminder of its more sordid past is certainly not burnishing its reputation. (Nor that of the press at large, according to some arguments.) More broadly, Gawker argues, a ruling in favor of Mr. Bollea could curtail the freedoms afforded the press when pursuing more salubrious causes.Mr. Bolleas lawyers argue, on the other hand, that the privacy of many Americans could be damaged by a ruling in favor of Gawker, and that the tape was simply not newsworthy.The trial has seen a clash of three provocative worlds  of the shock-jock and the former wrestling star, of the Manhattan media, and of the jurors, who presumably live in neither. That has led to a string of surreal moments.Mr. Bollea, while on the stand, to illustrate the distinction between himself and his fictional character, said that Hulk Hogan was better endowed than he was. Mr. Daulerio got in trouble for being sarcastic during a deposition, when he made a joke about sex tapes involving children, which he later clarified.At the request of Mr. Bolleas lawyer, Mr. Denton read aloud from Mr. Daulerios sexually explicit piece on the video, in a gentle British accent. And a juror asked Emma Carmichael, the editor of Jezebel, the feminist site,who was testifying about the publishing process, whether she had ever slept with Mr. Denton or Mr. Daulerio. The Tampa Bay Times, which has been following the trial, described that moment:The trial is nearing its end. The jury is likely to hear closing arguments this week, and must then decide whether to find for Gawker, or for Mr. Bollea. If it finds for Mr. Bollea, it must also set the scale of the damages.In that case, Gawker may have to pay a bond while it appeals, though that payment is itself subject to appeal."}

{"text": "GLASGOW  In a small, windowless room above Royal Exchange Square in Glasgow, Summera Shaheen has been customizing watches and creating jewelry for many of the worlds professional soccer players and their teams.DaMarcus Beasley, an American defense player for the Houston Dynamo and the United States national soccer team, is in large part responsible for her speciality. The two met in 2007 at a charity event in Glasgow, and she ended up making a ring for him. I was really into jewelry and diamonds, said Mr. Beasley, who was playing in Scotland at the time. We talked, and she made a pinkie ring for me with a princess-cut diamond. It was beautiful.I started taking my teammates to meet her. They like jewelry; they like watches; they like bling, he continued. I have played everywhere, so she has done work for my teammates from all different countries.In fact, Mr. Beasley has been such a big fan and steady customer, he has collaborated with Ms. Shaheens Diamond Studio business to create his own DaMarcus Collection of jewelry for men and women.Jewelry has long been an interest for Ms. Shaheen, a Glasgow native  Its my passion, she said. So after she completed a bachelors degree in politics and human resource management from the University of Strathclyde, she went to London to earn a certificate in diamond grading from the Gemological Institute of America.In 2006, she returned to Glasgow and started her own jewelry business. Its difficult for a small independent brand to get the stock that bigger jewelers have, she said. So I did a lot of custom work.Last year, Ms. Shaheen began a service she saucily calls Pimp My Watch. She was designing custom wedding rings for a couple when the groom asked her to create a surprise for his bride: He brought in a Rolex he had bought in America and asked me to add diamonds to it.Collaborating with a local man who has been working on watches for 25 years and getting cut stones from her usual sources, she created a bezel of white diamonds that can be added or removed from the watch, depending on how much dazzle is desired. He gave it to her on their wedding day, she said.Soon, other customers wanted their watches to be blinged out, too. A recent customer was going to start with having a diamond added to each number on the face and see how he likes it, she said. Then he might go for adding more diamonds to the bezel or case.Ms. Shaheens list of jewelry and watch clients from the soccer world is extensive, including Alan Martin, goalkeeper for the Scottish Premier League team Hamilton Academical; Maurice Edu, midfielder with the Philadephia Union and Team USA; Jozy Altidore, a forward for the Toronto Football Club and Team USA; Niall McGinn, a winger for the Aberdeen Football Club, another Scottish Premier League team, and the Northern Ireland national team; and Joe Ledley, a central midfielder with the English Premier League team Crystal Palace and the Welsh national team.Mr. Martin, who recently consulted Ms. Shaheen about adding gems to a Rolex he owns, said, I love the Diamond Studio because there is not any hassle with people trying to be in your face.Summera takes her time and gives ideas on what you could do with the diamonds, he said. She takes pride in her business and puts everything into it.Ms. Shaheen also creates authorized jewelry collections for several soccer teams, something she says is a first. No one has ever done quality official jewelry for sports associations before, at least not complete ranges, she said.And getting the agreements was not easy, she added. Its difficult for a female to be taken seriously, especially in the world of sports, she said, But because it was so hard, that made it exciting. If you see barriers, you just have to work harder.She uses a teams official colors as the starting point for the jewelry, which includes rings, bracelets, pendants, money clips, earrings and card cases that Ms. Shaheen noted are for holding your season tickets. Some items are ready made, but everything can be customized in silver, 9-karat gold or even platinum. (Jewelry starts at 50 pounds, or $70, and customized pieces at 300.)For example, white diamonds and red rubies can be used for Aberdeen team pieces, which have the team crest discreetly stamped on the back, or black and white diamonds for the Fulham Football Club, in the Football League Championship.Its not like the usual sports jewelry, she said. Its not hideous. And theres something for female fans to buy, too.She also is the official jeweler for the Scotland national team and just signed a contract with the Northern Ireland national team. On her dream list: signing up Team USA.Ms. Shaheen, however, always has her eye out for a new creation. Her latest is Diamond Dogs, a gold or silver tag studded with a small diamond and the dogs name and, on the back, the owners name or whatever information is requested.In December, when George Clooney was in Edinburgh at the Scottish Business Awards, the Scottish Chamber of Commerce presented one to the actor engraved for Millie, the basset hound that he and his wife adopted from a California shelter.Mr. Martin, the Hamilton goalkeeper, has three dogs and is discussing getting tags for them all. And what does Ms. Shaheen plan to call the line in her businesss social media outreach? Pimp My Dog, she said with a laugh."}
{"text": "Arthur Nazaryan wasnt the first inexperienced photographer to venture into Somalia for a few weeks and barely scratch the surface covering famine and conflict. After working in Mogadishu in 2012, he realized the only way to make meaningful images was to spend much more time there.But it is expensive for an American photographer to work safely in Mogadishu, and he lacked the money for an extended stay. He was, however, determined to document the Somali people, whom he admired, so he charted a different course: He went to Minneapolis, which is home to some 30,000 Somalis, most of whom came as refugees since 1990.Mr. Nazaryan arrived there a few weeks after six young Somali men were arrested, charged with trying to join the Islamic State terrorist group. From 2007 to 2009 more than a dozen young Somalis left the Minneapolis area to join the Shabab, an Islamist militant group fighting in Somalia.Many people were hesitant to be photographed, he said, assuming immediately that he  like other journalists  was there to depict them with cartoonish stereotypes as a community of extremists.They are only portrayed as pirates, terrorists or victims of war and famine in Africa and as ISIS recruits or refugees leeching off of the system in the United States, said Mr. Nazaryan, 31. In reality they are hardworking, resourceful people who have managed terrible circumstances with incredible resilience and grace. And just a handful of Somalis in Minnesota have any interest in supporting ISIS.Mr. Nazaryan began photographing in a charter public high school, which was about 75 percent Somali. Most of the students seemed to have adapted to America  listening to hip-hop and using social media while staying true to their traditional culture, he said. One day he was photographing Somalis dancing at a graduation party on a boat and the next day they were praying at a mosque. While the young people seemed quite American to Mr. Nazaryan, they tended to hang out with each other, often speaking the Somali language.Theyre definitely very proud to be Somali, he said. And theyre deeply religious.Mr. Nazaryan photographed the lifestyles of young Somalis in their 20s as well as at weddings, cultural events, businesses and a Somali independence day festival.Although at first most everyone he met assumed he was there solely because of the ISIS arrests, some warmed to him after they learned he had been to Somalia and knew the places they hailed from. Others just got used to seeing him in their community.Mr. Nazaryan is himself an immigrant from Russia who moved to Hartford with his parents when he was 5. His experience was quite different from that of the Somali youths he photographed. While there were stereotypes of Russians that he had to confront, he said, the Somali immigrants are dealing with a mountain of stigma.The most stark difference is the Russian community is not being scrutinized by the F.B.I. and the government in the same way, he said. Theres a very active fear of paid F.B.I. informants trying to get Somali kids in trouble. And they are in the age of Donald Trump wanting to bar Muslims from coming to the United States.Follow Arthur Nazaryan on Instagram. Follow @jamesestrin and @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

{"text": "Another former employee of a Federal Reserve Bank has admitted walking off with confidential documents.On Thursday, a former senior analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago pleaded guilty in federal court to one count of misdemeanor theft for taking 35 confidential financial documents from the bank as he was leaving it for a new job.The documents including financial data and information about the health of various financial institutions in the United States, according to the plea agreement for Jeffrey Cho, 35, who faces a maximum sentence of one year in federal prison. His sentencing is scheduled for June.Prosecutors said Mr. Cho took the documents home even though he knew he was not permitted to do so. They also said he initially denied taking them, under F.B.I. questioning. He later admitted he had taken them home and shredded most of them after the first F.B.I. interview last June.He has accepted responsibility and wants to move forward, said Damon Cheronis, Mr. Chos lawyer.According to his plea agreement, Mr. Cho worked at the Chicago Fed from March 2011 to May 2015. He had access to financial data and information related to the banks responsibility for assessing and monitoring the health of certain financial institutions.A spokesman for the Chicago Fed, Daniel Wassmann, said: We are grateful for the quick and thorough work of the F.B.I. and the U.S. attorneys office that led to a successful and timely prosecution of Mr. Cho.On Wednesday, a former employee of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was sentenced to one year of probation for leaking confidential Fed information to his former boss, who had left the Fed for a job at Goldman Sachs.The ex-New York Fed employee, Jason Gross, admitted last year that he gave information from the Fed about a midsize bank to his former boss, who had joined a group at Goldman that was advising that bank.Both men were fired from their jobs. Mr. Gross also has to pay a $2,000 fine and serve 200 hours of community service. Goldman Sachs paid a $50 million fine last fall to the New York Department of Financial Services.In Mr. Chos case, he took the documents when he was in discussions with a company about a job. Mr. Cho took the documents home both before and after he accepted the job offer in May.He also admitted in the plea agreement that he printed confidential Fed documents in March 2015, while he was interviewing for a position with another company. Those documents were also related to the health of certain financial institutions in the United States, prosecutors said."}
{"text": "Mo Willems became an author-illustrator of childrens books just 13 years ago. Yet certain of his characters  the loudmouth pigeon; the snugly, enigmatically silent Knuffle Bunny; the emotive comedy duo of Elephant and Piggie  come off as longtime residents of the picture-book world. Drawn with deceptively simple lines and embedded in stories that find depth in utterly commonplace childhood experiences, they are the rare imaginary creatures that have seemed indelible from their first appearances.If theres a living creator of childrens books who stands a chance of occupying a cultural position akin to a Dr. Seuss or a Charles M. Schulz, its Mr. Willems. Never mind, then, that the original audience of his first book, Dont Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus!, is still within spitting distance of high school graduation. It seems entirely appropriate that The Art and Whimsy of Mo Willems, a sort of midcareer retrospective, opens on Friday at the New-York Historical Society.The New-York Historical Society is home to the thriving DiMenna Childrens History Museum, on the lower level, and this is the historical societys second full-fledged exhibition to focus on childrens books. Madeline in New York: The Art of Ludwig Bemelmans ran in 2014, drawing crowds of children and teary-eyed adults who grew up with the mysterious Old World charisma of the Madeline books. This time the adult visitors will likely include not just parents, grandparents and teachers who have enjoyed Mr. Willemss stories with the children of this millennium, but also members of his following among cartoonists, illustrators and designers. His peers admire his ability to pack exhilarating humor and emotional resonance into a remarkable economy of line.Mr. Willems, now 48, was raised in New Orleans and lives in Northampton, Mass., not far from the Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art in Amherst, where this show originated and was organized. But he graduated from New York Universitys Tisch School of the Arts and spent his early adulthood in New York City, where he was an aspiring filmmaker, stand-up comic and animator. Eventually he landed a gig as a writer and animator for Sesame Street and spent nine seasons on the show, creating the character Suzie Kabloozie and winning six Emmys.You can take Mr. Willems out of New York, but you cant take New York out of his characters. This exhibition makes clear that the city  where Mr. Willems became a parent when his daughter, Trixie, was born in 2001  is the emotional home base of the childrens books that were first published in 2003.Take the wily, insistent, hopped-up pigeon, who spends five books trying to find a way around various unavoidable truths, like the fact that birds cannot drive buses or have pet puppies. His personality came from New York, Mr. Willems says on the shows audio tour, which he narrates. There is no way I could have created the pigeon if I had spent my life living somewhere else. And ask adults of a certain age to describe the humor of the Elephant and Piggie series, and the name Woody Allen invariably pops up.Then, of course, there are the three Knuffle Bunny books, published between 2004 and 2010, in which Mr. Willems tells a story about his own family, superimposing his drawings over photos of a brownstone Brooklyn that already looks a bit vintage. How time has flown. Mr. Willems captured a Park Slope that was still on the scruffy side  before indoor play spaces and pottery-painting joints took this neighborhood by storm, when a do-it-yourself laundromat could plausibly serve as a toddlers afternoon entertainment. A trip to that mechanical wonderland sets up the first storys drama, as Mr. Willems accidentally leaves Trixies beloved stuffed animal in a washing machine. Knuffle Bunny became an emblem of early-21st-century New York City childhood, Brooklyn-style, joining the ranks of childrens literatures famous imaginary Manhattanites like Lyle the Crocodile of East 88th Street and Chester, the cricket hunkered down in Times Square.At the New-York Historical Society, a curatorial team has tweaked the original Carle Museum show, abridging it from about 150 to just under 100 pieces and playing up its New York themes. Most significantly, a piece has been added that was not in the first iteration: the complete five-page text of a graphic short story Mr. Willems created for DC Comics after Sept. 11, called Walking the Williamsburg Bridge to Work. A plate of the first three pages hangs on the wall facing the entrance to the exhibition, with the final two pages open in a case below. This is meant for the shows adult visitors.It is a devastating piece of work, compressing, as the best comics do, enormous meaning and emotion. Mr. Willems depicts himself walking to work in a self-absorbed haze. Then he stands with members of a cross-section of New York on the smoky bridge as they all fall silent, then begin chattering desperately, trying to understand what is happening on the Manhattan side of the East River. Slowly the horrific reality becomes clear. As he makes his way home we see a man already changed.How could they do this to my city? he thinks. The final panels show Mr. Willems opening the door to his apartment, saying, Honey, Im home. His wife, her features torqued in confusion and grief, holds their infant daughter. Behind them, on a television screen and outside the windows, we see the twin towers burning. Home, we understand, will never be the same again.The rest of this show is pitched to include children, as is the audio tour. Mr. Willems delivers kid-friendly jokes and clear explanations of how he makes his art. Free headsets are placed in childrens reach on the wall inside the shows entrance, and Mr. Willems directs his listeners right past the Sept. 11 story, into the next room, which is focused on his most famous characters.The cast of the Knuffle Bunny books comes first, even though the pigeon is an earlier creation. This nonchronological order, presumably, is meant to call adults attention to the fact that the baby we first saw in Walking the Williamsburg Bridge to Work is Trixie, is the preverbal, tantrum-throwing toddler of Knuffle Bunny. Her parents, now a bit comically helicoptery, once held her as they watched their city under attack. With that context we see the delightful art from Knuffle Bunny in a more poignant and serious light. Its a canny move in a show that makes a case for Mr. Willemss cultural importance. Unlike Dr. Seuss, Mr. Willems has not introduced overt political themes into his childrens work, but here is evidence that they are there, if submerged.Much of the focus is on Mr. Willemss process  how he creates characters, and then builds his picture books around them. We learn that Mr. Schulz was Mr. Willemss childhood hero, and that he considers himself not an illustrator but, like Mr. Schulz, a cartoonist, who uses letters and shapes and drawings to create one work.The simplicity of Mr. Willemss lines and stories is the result of strictly methodical, even obsessive, work. Put as little in as possible, he is quoted as saying in the shows catalog. Several sketches are shown alongside the finished drawings, and we can see where he made the tiniest of changes  the pigeons wing extended by mere millimeters, the angle of the angst-ridden Gerald the Elephants knocked knees expanded infinitesimally. A tone of practical encouragement to young artists prevails. A video invites visitors into Mr. Willemss studio, where he works on a drawing and offers tips such as Dont be afraid to move your paper around!Listeners who stick it out with the audio tour to the final room will be rewarded with more madcap Willems charm as he introduces the cover and two illustrations from the 25th and final Elephant and Piggie book, The Thank You Book, which will be published in May. Elephant and Piggie are my two best friends, he says, more or less believably.Around the corner is a drawing from Naked Mole Rat Gets Dressed, which, Mr. Willems says in the audio, he drew with a pen nib that belonged to Mr. Schulz. When he was 5, Mr. Willems explains, he wrote a letter to Mr. Schulz saying, Dear Mr. Schulz, can I have your job when you are dead? There was no response. But after Mr. Schulz died, Mr. Willems became friends with his widow, Jean, who gave him one of his nibs. By all evidence in this show, hes found a way to make the job his own, too.Here is a sampling of events related to the Mo Willems exhibition. They are free with museum admission.

{"text": "In an airy, light-filled space in the Rochelle School in London, what was once a charming Victorian classroom today serves as the office of Luncheon Magazine, a fresh-off-the-press independent title with a self-professed appetite for style and culture. Clues to the pedigree of its editors-in-chief Frances von Hofmannsthal and Thomas Persson are scattered throughout the Shoreditch studio. On a vast radiator lean a triptych of framed black-and-white prints: a shot of the photographer Paolo Roversis studio (where von Hofmannsthal served as a photographic assistant for some five years), a \"Cigarettes\" series by Irving Penn and an image of Leigh Bowery taken between portrait sittings with Lucien Freud. A copy of \"The Private Life of Greta Garbo\" sits on a desk with a handwritten note from the fashion designer Erdem Moralioglu (He saw it and thought of me, quips Persson).With its oversize format (it measures 27 by 38 centimeters), uncoated Italian paper and unfussy layouts, Luncheon has the air of a 1950s issue of Vogue or Life: It is elegant, but in a deliberately non-glossy way. Persson speaks nostalgically of that era, when magazines seemed to be designed around how the eye moves across the page. Though Luncheon is not a food magazine per se, its peppered with clever nods to cooking and consuming it: There are recipes by the British chefs Margot Henderson and Melanie Arnold (who run the celebrated Rochelle Canteen just downstairs from their office), beguiling illustrations of personified pheasant pies and vegetable medleys by the stage designer Oliver Messel (von Hofmannsthal, the daughter of the photographer Lord Snowdon and Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, is Messels great niece) and an interview with Paolo Roversi  who, just after shooting a darkly romantic fashion story with Anna Cleveland in Comme des Garons, which appears as one of the magazines main dishes, hosted the brands president for lunch (and vodka) in his Paris studio.We wanted to try to incorporate that spirit when you take the time to sit down and eat with friends, says von Hofmannsthal, while absentmindedly plaiting her hair. But its not necessarily high-end. Its meant to be playful and inclusive. The perfect lunch could be eating a jam sandwich on a park bench. In keeping with Luncheons irreverent spirit, the first edition will be sold exclusively from inside a domed booth modelled on Pariss circular newspaper kiosks, inside the newly rehoused Dover Street Market in Londons Haymarket, which opens in the former Burberry building this weekend. The launch also coincides with von Hofmannsthals introduction of a 36-piece collection of coats and bags  which also make their debut at Dover Street Market, and whose mottled cloth has been fashioned after the hand-painted backdrops used by her father, painstakingly replicated by a specialist dyeing team at the Royal Opera House.Luncheon is not the first project the pair has collaborated on. On the recommendation of friends, von Hofmannsthal and Persson endured an awkward first meeting in an East London pub (he had a pint, she had a cup of tea). Persson was then working as the editor and creative director of Acne Paper (which shuttered in 2013) and von Hofmannsthal had just taken over her fathers photographic archive. Soon, they produced two books  Snowdon Blue and Snowdon: A Life in View  with Persson as creative director and von Hofmannsthal as editor, and began plotting their own publication. We always met over lunch because Francis has children, explains Persson. So that became a part of our friendship. We were thinking about a name, then her daughter Maude said: Mummy I love the word lunch. But lunch felt too foodie, so we dusted off luncheon which sounds bigger and more celebratory.Though Luncheon wont be running a website, the creative duo is tentatively embracing the digital world via Instagram. In fact, their first post  an image by their photographer friend Peter Schlesinger entitled Pink Garden  serves as a tidy tribute to their ethos. A detail shot of a table setting, decorated with pink linen and cut flowers, was taken in the 1970s when Schlesinger and his then partner David Hockney visited the Chteau Mouton, the wine estate of Baron Philippe de Rothschild. Thats the lunch you want to be at, concludes von Hofmannsthal, before heading down to the Rochelle Canteen for the obligatory team meal. The flowers, all that pink  it perfectly denotes the imagination of the table."}
{"text": "On Tuesday night, Hillary Clinton won four Democratic primaries (possibly five with Missouri). After her victory speech, MSNBCs Joe Scarborough offered a critique on Twitter: Smile. You just had a big night.On Wednesday night, she made a cameo on Comedy Centrals Broad City, trying to get a laugh, if not yet the last one.Mr. Scarboroughs remark (echoed by commentators including Fox News Brit Hume) was nothing female candidates havent heard before from male pundits: Be approachable! But not soft! It wouldnt kill you to laugh! But oh God, dont laugh like that!But the critique is also curious when you consider what was possibly Mrs. Clintons high-water mark as pop-political icon: the Texts From Hillary Tumblr meme, which captioned photos of then-Secretary of State Clinton on a military transport plane, wearing sunglasses and staring intently at a BlackBerry.She wasnt smiling, which was exactly the point: The images played off the notion of Mrs. Clinton as a take-no-prisoners professional, getting it done. As enshrined in Texts From Hillary, she wasnt approachable, she was sharp-witted, fearsome  and, above all, cool.That was 201112; this is now. The meme machine has moved on to new iconography, like the hip-hop-styling of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as Notorious R.B.G.  and, of course, Mrs. Clintons opponent, Bernie Sanders, who has won over millennials and been lionized in online culture while Mrs. Clinton has fielded endless uncomfortable questions about why more young women werent supporting her.All this may explain why Mrs. Clinton said yes to the pitch  via the shows executive producer Amy Poehler  that she appear on Broad City, which is millennial, ardently feminist and a virtual fountain of Internet GIFs. Late-night talk shows and Saturday Night Live are still integral to campaigns, but in todays politics, the dream is to meme: to be portrayed in images that frame you through the lenses of another viewers passion.Mrs. Clintons part on the episode, titled 2016, was relatively small. (The episodes other story, a descent into the hell of the New York Department of Motor Vehicles, was funnier.) Ilana (Ilana Glazer), having lost her job, ends up cold-calling voters at Clinton headquarters in Brooklyn. In the story lines first GIF-able moment, upon realizing that shes in Mrs. Clintons office, Ilana rears up to a swell of choral music and salutes, like the feminist analogue of a World War II recruitment film.The episode mainly leaves the politicking to other characters, especially Cynthia Nixon, a guest star playing a Clinton staffer, who runs down a list of answers to commonly asked questions: No, Hillary does not cry at the office. Yes, Hillary can read a map. No, Hillary will not enforce male birth control or male pregnancy, as that is not a thing. And no, Hillary is not a witch.Politicians on sitcoms tend to be a drag on the action  stiff, accustomed to a different kind of scripted performance. Their cameos are often to be memorable less for what the guest does than for how he or she fits into the characters world. Think of Ms. Poehlers zealous public servant Leslie Knope on Parks and Recreation, going gaga over her idol Joe Biden, which says as much about her nerdy intensity as about the vice president.When Mrs. Clinton finally appears, Broad City makes the inevitable unnaturalness and artifice of the appearance fit the shows air of magic surrealism. We see her the way the star-struck Ilana and Abbi (Abbi Jacobson) do: striding in slow-motion, winking hello as a light bulb explodes in the background. A tongue-tied Abbi introduces herself: Abbi. Hello! Proud Demo. Crat!The scene lays it on thick, but Broad City, a comedy about passionate friendship, does not love lightly. Whether or not the episode cools a single millennials Bern for Mr. Sanders, it is an example of pop-culture politicking in the meme era  one thats less about humanizing the candidate than imagining her as a kind of stylized artwork, not likable so much as shareable.At minimum, 2016 closes on a memorable image. Calling back to an earlier episode, Mrs. Clinton drags out an inflatable air dancer for office morale. Inflating the bendy figure, she asks, Isnt she great?Of course, says Ilana. We assumed it was a he.Oh, no, no, Mrs. Clinton answers. Its a she. Its definitely a she. She pulls in the overawed friends for a hug, and whats that on her face? A smile."}
{"text": "Patrick J. Foye, the last executive director the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey expects to have, is not leaving at the end of the month after all.Mr. Foye announced his resignation in November, effective March 31. But with two weeks left in his tenure, he has been persuaded to remain in the executive position until a search for a new chief executive is completed, the authority said on Thursday.Mr. Foye will continue to oversee plans for a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River, an overhaul of La Guardia Airport and a replacement for the bus terminal in Midtown Manhattan, among other projects.The authoritys board of commissioners hired an executive-search firm last year to begin looking for a chief executive. Mr. Foye was considered as a candidate for the position. But after the first round of the search, the commissioners decided they were not satisfied with the choices presented and extended the hunt.Disappointed in not being chosen, Mr. Foye said he would leave at the end of March, whether or not his successor had been identified. As recently as two weeks ago, the board was preparing to temporarily elevate the authoritys chief financial officer, Elizabeth McCarthy, to fill in as interim executive director.Mr. Foyes annual salary is $290,000, but the authority is offering to pay a chief executive $450,000 a year.Scott Rechler, the vice chairman of the board, said the commissioners had a few alternatives in mind for bridging the gap to a permanent chief executive. But he said their preference had been for Mr. Foye to stay longer.It was never ideal for Pat to leave before we had a C.E.O. in place, Mr. Rechler said in an interview on Thursday.The authority said the commissioners would provide an update on the search when they meet again on Wednesday.Mr. Foyes about-face surprised several people who pay close attention to the Port Authoritys operations, including Loretta Weinberg, a Democratic state senator in New Jersey.Ms. Weinberg, who attends many of the authoritys board meetings, said on Thursday that she had not heard that Mr. Foye was staying on. She was not pleased about the development.Pat Foye resigned as of the end of March, Ms. Weinberg said in an interview. So I am a fan of letting him continue his resignation and finding a good C.E.O.Mr. Foye was seen by some as a hero for blowing the whistle on a scheme by some allies of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to tie up traffic at the George Washington Bridge in September 2013. He called attention to the sudden closing off of lanes of traffic leading to the bridge and angered David Samson, then the chairman of the authority, who was close to Mr. Christie, a Republican.Still, Mr. Foye really did not do anything to straighten out the mess that had grown there, Senator Weinberg said, adding, Ive said many times that there are and were no heroes in this."}
{"text": "JOHANNESBURG   President Jacob G. Zuma of South Africa, reeling from new allegations of corruption and growing criticism from inside his own party, on Thursday denied accusations that a wealthy family with close links to his own had influenced his appointment of ministers.In a parliamentary session, Mr. Zuma rejected statements made in recent days by current and former government officials that they had been offered ministerial positions by the Guptas, a family with widespread business interests and links to one of Mr. Zumas sons.Im in charge of the government, Mr. Zuma said. I appoint in terms of the Constitution.Opposition leaders urged Mr. Zuma to resign. You and your family are getting richer while South Africans are getting poorer, said Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the main opposition party, the Democratic Alliance.Under Mr. Zuma, who has been entangled in a series of personal scandals since taking office in 2009, the governing African National Congress has steadily lost popular support and faces the risk of losing in critical local elections this year.Since Mr. Zumas handling of a crucial government appointment in December dealt a blow to South Africas struggling economy, party officials have expressed growing concerns about widening corruption and talked increasingly of state capture, or parts of the government falling under private influence. On Thursday, the A.N.C.s secretary general, Gwede Mantashe, said that corruption could turn South Africa into a mafia state.Some officials blamed the Guptas, who have long been accused of using their ties to Mr. Zuma to further their interests and wield influence over government.One of Mr. Zumas sons, Duduzane, is a business partner of the Guptas, three brothers  Ajay, Atul and Rajesh  who came to South Africa from India in the early 1990s. Starting with a computer company called Sahara, they have built an empire in mining, transportation, technology and media. They own a newspaper and television network which tend to offer favorable coverage of Mr. Zuma and the A.N.C.Some senior party leaders directly criticized Mr. Zuma on Thursday. To those people who believe they still need to defend Zuma and have benefited from a close relationship with the Guptas, I appeal to them now to stand back, Barbara Hogan, a former minister of public enterprises under Mr. Zuma, said in call to a radio station.A day earlier, Mcebisi Jonas, the deputy finance minister, said in a statement that in a meeting with the Guptas in December they had offered him the job of finance minister. Mr. Jonas  who on Thursday drew statements of support from many high-ranking government officials  said he immediately rejected the offer.In December, a few days after the alleged offer to Mr. Jonas, Mr. Zuma removed a widely respected finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, and replaced him with a little-known legislator, a decision that shocked the financial markets, sent the rand plummeting and also drew criticism from senior party members and businessmen. Critics of the decision said that, in appointing a pliable finance minister, Mr. Zuma was seeking to ease financing for public projects that would benefit the Guptas and other allies.Mr. Zuma was forced to reverse himself a few days later by removing his new finance minister and reappointing a well-regarded former finance minister, Pravin Gordhan, who had served from 2009 to 2014. Mr. Gordhan has spent the last three months trying to reassure investors and persuade credit-rating agencies not to downgrade South Africas government debt to junk status.But analysts say that continuing doubts about governance in South Africa  as well as a drought and low commodity prices that have hurt its economy  will make it difficult for the nation to fend off an eventual downgrade.A day before Mr. Jonass statement about the offer of a post, a former A.N.C. lawmaker, Vytjie Mentor, wrote on her Facebook page that the Guptas had offered her the position of minister of public enterprises in 2010. Ms. Mentor wrote that the offer was made in a meeting inside their house, in which Mr. Zuma was also present.The Gupta brothers, all in their 40s, have released statements denying the recent allegations. Mr. Zuma said he had no recollection of Ms. Mentor.In Parliament on Thursday, Mr. Zuma said he knew nothing about the alleged offer made by the Guptas to Mr. Jonas.If Jonas says he was offered by the Guptas, I think you will be well placed to ask the Guptas, or Jonas, Mr. Zuma said, as members of his party cheered. Dont ask me. Where do I come in? I have no business with that."}
{"text": "PROVIDENCE, R.I.   James Jones, the Yale coach, walked across the floor, arms raised in triumph. He approached the Bulldogs fans in the stands at Dunkin Donuts Center and slammed his hands on the press table. Immediately behind him, the Ivy League player of the year, Justin Sears, lay on his back on the court, in equal parts frustration and elation.Players hugged players. Coaches hugged coaches. Fans hugged fans.Yale, improbably, had done it.The 12th-seeded Bulldogs, making their first N.C.A.A. tournament appearance since 1962, made it a memorable one, stunning No. 5-seeded Baylor, 79-75, in opening-round play in the West Region on Thursday. It was the first N.C.A.A. tournament victory in four appearances for the Bulldogs.Its huge, said Sears, who scored 18 points. Just to be among the first guys to get that first big win of the tournament is huge. Everyone is going to look back and say this is the team where it started. Its great right now.Yale will face No. 4-seeded Duke on Saturday. The teams met on Nov. 25, with Duke winning, 80-61. On Thursday, Duke beat U.N.C. Wilmington, 93-85.The win over Baylor was yet another huge victory for the Bulldogs, the Ivy champions, who have won eight of nine games since the senior captain Jack Montague left the team in February. Montague, expelled because of allegations of sexual misconduct, was at the game, but he left his seat in the second half after being approached by reporters. He referred any questions to a statement issued Monday in which he vowed to fight the expulsion.Yale (23-6) got a game-high 31 points from the sophomore Makai Mason, 17 in a tour-de-force first half in which Yale took a 39-34 lead. In the second half, Mason went 10 of 10 from the free-throw line.Yale outrebounded the taller, more athletic Bears by 36-32 and survived despite losing Sears and Brandon Sherrod (10 points) for several minutes in the second half because of foul trouble.Asked about the rebounding differential, Baylors Taurean Prince said with sarcasm: You go up and grab the ball off the rim when it comes off. And then you grab it with two hands. Then you come down with it. Thats considered a rebound. They got more of those than we did.With Sears and Sherrod, both first-team all-Ivy players, on the bench, Yale not only persevered but prospered. Sam Downey, a junior, and Blake Reynolds, a freshman, came in, and Yale went on a 12-5 run to build the lead back to 9 points. In the 54 seconds that Mason rested, there was a big basket by his backup, the freshman Trey Phills, son of the former N.B.A. player Bobby Phills.I thought that was the key stretch in the game, said Jones, who is in his 17th year at Yale. Those guys really gave us a lift. They changed the game and gave us a chance to win.Downey said, Im sure most fans were thinking we were in trouble when Justin and Brandon went out, but Blake and I do this all the time in practice, and weve learned from them.The Bulldogs eventually extended the lead to 13 (64-51 with around seven minutes remaining), and then it became a test of endurance. Behind Prince (team-high 28 points), Baylor (22-12) whittled away until it had possession of the ball with six seconds left and trailed, 77-75.Point guard Lester Medford tried to drive to the basket, but he slipped and lost the ball.We were trying to spread them out and get Lester in the paint, said Baylor Coach Scott Drew, whose Bears were first-round upset victims last year to R. J. Hunter and No. 14-seeded Georgia State. Hes done that all year. We felt comfortable hed be able to create an opportunity for somebody else.Sherrod was credited with the steal. He was fouled and made both free throws with 2.2 seconds to play.When it was over, Sears fell to the floor, but it was not all that one might think. He revealed that he had promised to join his senior teammates and get a 2016 tattoo on his thigh if Yale won.Im the only senior who hasnt done it, but now I guess I have to, he said. So yeah, it was a bit of mixed emotions. Frustrated that I lost the bet. But really, really happy that we won the game."}
{"text": "Describing his approach to programming before Thursdays concert by the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, the conductor Leon Botstein said, We deal in the purgatory department. Throughout history, he explained, some pieces seemed to go directly from their premieres to a lofty place in the heaven of the standard repertory. Others are consigned to hell.But there are reams of works valued in their time that have fallen into the purgatory of neglect. Championing them has been Mr. Botsteins mission, as in this program, Giant in the Shadows, focused on the German composer, pianist and organist Max Reger, who died in 1916 at 43.The centerpiece was a rare performance of Regers 45-minute Piano Concerto with Peter Serkin as soloist. Composed in 1910, this sprawling piece shows why Reger both fascinated and baffled his contemporaries. The concerto seems an attempt to balance the advanced chromatic language of Wagner with Brahmss feeling for classical structure. In pushing the boundaries of tonality, the music shows Reger as a kindred spirit to Schoenberg.Rudolf Serkin, Peters father, championed the Reger concerto in his youth and recorded it in 1959 with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Here his son played the ferociously demanding piano part with impressive command and affecting sensitivity.I was grateful for this opportunity to hear it performed. Still, the concert, which lasted 2 hours and 40 minutes, also showed the downside of Mr. Botsteins exercises in advocacy by immersion. It opened with Adolf Buschs Three tudes for Orchestra, from 1940. Busch, an important German violinist and conductor and a younger colleague of Regers, became Rudolf Serkins father-in-law (and therefore Peters grandfather). Alas, to make a better impression, this 30-minute piece needed a stronger performance than the shaky one Mr. Botstein led. It was not the best setup piece for the concerto.After intermission Mr. Botstein conducted Regers Variations and Fugue on a Theme of J. A. Hiller (1907), another long (42 minutes) and demanding work that in this ineffective performance sounded meandering and gloppy. I felt sympathy for the skilled players of this intrepid orchestra who had to grapple with three unfamiliar, challenging scores. It was a lot to ask of an audience as well. Many people headed for the exits at intermission.That the concerto came across as the strongest piece was because of Mr. Serkins splendid performance, which inspired the orchestra to its most solid, textured playing. The colossal first movement has moments in which majestic themes unfold in segmented phrases and episodes where motifs go through complex harmonic sequences. The slow movement is the gem of the piece, with stretches of dreamy, pensive music. The finale shows Reger attempting heavy-footed, dancing Germanic humor.The untethered harmonic language, along with the developmental approach to form, could easily make the concerto seem long-winded. But Mr. Serkins involving performance conveyed its searching character and integrity."}
{"text": "BEIJING   A Chinese journalist who had written critically of the government was being held by the authorities on Friday on suspicion that he helped draft a letter calling for the resignation of President Xi Jinping, his lawyer and friends said.The journalist, Jia Jia, a 35-year-old freelance writer based in Beijing, was detained on Tuesday as he prepared to board a flight to Hong Kong, according to his lawyer, Yan Xin.The letter the authorities were investigating was an incendiary denunciation of Mr. Xis leadership that also spoke of threats to the presidents safety if he did not resign, friends and relatives of Mr. Jia said.The letter, which was published this month on a Chinese news site and widely circulated online, was signed simply, Loyal Communist Party members. Mr. Jia told friends before his detention that he had not written the letter.Human rights advocates criticized the Chinese governments handling of the case, saying that it appeared to be part of an effort to harass and silence critics. Under Mr. Xi, the government has taken an increasingly hard line toward dissent, imprisoning dozens of lawyers, activists and journalists and demanding absolute loyalty from the news media.It seems its no longer enough for Chinese authorities to erase all trace of criticism  it now seems bent on erasing all trace of its critics, too, said Sophie Richardson, China director for Human Rights Watch.The Committee to Protect Journalists, an advocacy group based in New York, said in a statement late Thursday that it was deeply concerned by Mr. Jias disappearance.Officials must disclose where they are holding him and why, said Bob Dietz, the coordinator of the committees Asia program.Airport security officials said they had no information on Mr. Jia.Mr. Jia is known for his wry, pointed style, embodied in one of his favorite catchphrases: I am not a mouthpiece. He has taken on topics deemed sensitive by the government with uncharacteristic zeal, writing bitter critiques of corrupt officials and scathing indictments of the Communist Partys control of information.After chemical explosions erupted last year in \nTianjin, a northeastern port city, killing 165 people, Mr. Jia lamented the lack of public accountability. Why is it that tragedies are always turned into occasions to praise the government? he wrote. His social media accounts were quickly shut down.While Mr. Jia is capable of cynicism, he has not been an advocate of regime change in China, friends and colleagues said.He doesnt have strong opinions about the current leadership, said Wu Qiang, a freelance writer and former lecturer in political science at Tsinghua University in Beijing. He is a relative moderate.In the days leading up to his apparent detention, as the authorities questioned Mr. Jias relatives, Mr. Jia told friends that he had nothing to do with the letter. When Mr. Jia saw the letter on the website of Wujie News, a state-run publication, he notified a friend at the publication, fearing he might be punished, according to Zhao Hui, a fellow writer.The letter attacked Mr. Xis handling of social, diplomatic and economic affairs, and it criticized his tight grip on power. It also implied threats to the safety of Mr. Xi and his family if he stayed in office.How could it be possible that he wrote it? Mr. Zhao said. It could never happen.It was unclear how the letter made it past Chinas vast censorship apparatus; editors at Wujie News did not respond to requests for comment.In recent months, the authorities in Beijing have cracked down on criticism of Mr. Xi. In one of the most high-profile cases, several booksellers in Hong Kong vanished after publishing materials critical of the Communist Party.The authorities appeared to be conducting a broad investigation into the letter, which emerged as Chinas political leaders were gathering in Beijing for a meeting of the national legislature.Wen Yunchao, a Chinese writer living in New York and a friend of Mr. Jias, said that his own parents, who live in China, had recently been questioned about whether he had any involvement in drafting the letter. It has zero relation to me, Mr. Wen wrote on Twitter."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Back in the 1980s, a group of social workers in Jamaica visited low-income homes one hour a week for two years, bearing age-appropriate toys for the kids and advice on child rearing for the parents. Researchers tracked the outcomes, and a generation later, the results are in.The children whose homes were visited by social workers became adults who earn wages that are 25 percent higher than those earned by peers who had not been visited. Their I.Q.s are an average seven points higher, and they are less likely to resort to crime or suffer from depression.Other studies, including several recent ones in the United States, have shown similar results, contributing to a consensus on the importance of early childhood development that has led governments around the world to increase spending on the first five years of life. In Latin America and the Caribbean, a region of longstanding social and economic inequality, several countries have been especially ambitious. Brazil and Chile doubled the coverage of day care services over the past decade, while in Ecuador they grew sixfold.These investments build on historic gains in child nutrition and health. But while Latin American children are now healthier and more likely to attend preschool, they still lag far behind in learning, particularly in the areas of language and cognition, when compared with their counterparts in wealthy countries.What are we doing wrong?New research indicates that the problem starts with the types of interactions that children have with adults at home, in day care or in preschool. For example, vocabulary at early ages is a key predictor of school success. But one study found that 5-year-old children of mothers with low education levels already struggle with a word gap: They recognize fewer than half of the words recognized by children of better-educated mothers. Likewise, children who are stuck with a poorly trained day care staff would be better off staying at home with other adults who have been coached in how to properly stimulate children, as was the case in Jamaica.Since these early deficits carry over into later years, it comes as no surprise that Latin American teenagers rank near the bottom of international standardized tests. And within these countries, disparities in learning rooted in social and economic disadvantages only perpetuate inequality. Governments must adjust course if they want to ensure that investments in early childhood will have the desired impact.At present, the youngest get too small a slice of the pie. Our research shows that for every education dollar spent on a child age 5 and under, more than three dollars are spent on a child between 6 and 11 years old. And as a percentage of gross domestic product, Latin American and Caribbean countries spend about half of the average spent on pre-primary and day care programs in all countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Money helps, but better quality is critical. Research shows that at home, in day care or in preschool, children who develop a strong bond with at least one caregiver reap cognitive benefits that last into adulthood. This is why the Jamaica home interventions were so effective. In fact, home visits produced average growth in cognitive skills about 10 times larger than day care programs. In Peru, a home-visitation program initiated in 2013 has benefited 52,000 children, most of them from the rural poor, at a cost of $500 per child. And yet, most governments favor building day care centers rather than backing good parenting initiatives.When children do attend day care or preschool, they should be served by carefully selected and trained caregivers and teachers. We tested 16,000 children in Ecuador over three years of early schooling, from kindergarten to second grade. On average, those who had been in the care of three bad teachers in succession moved from the middle third to the bottom third of those who took a math test at the end of second grade. Children whod had three outstanding teachers in a row moved from the middle to the top third.Parents, of course, know that teachers matter. But while officials like the ribbon-cutting that comes with opening impressive new facilities, making sure that they are adequately staffed is often an afterthought.The lesson is clear: When children must be cared for outside the home, all governments should focus on recruiting and training quality caregivers. And instead of rushing to build more day care centers and expand coverage of existing day care programs, developing countries in particular would be smarter to prioritize cost-effective home visit programs that improve parenting practices and the stimulation of young children. A recent review of such programs in 21 countries, including Brazil, Jamaica, Bangladesh, China, Uganda and India, found that they delivered measurable cognitive benefits across a vast range of cultural and economic settings.As Latin Americas many fine coffee producers know, many things can go wrong if you dont fertilize your trees and treat the berries properly. But if you take great care at the start, you end up with world-class brews. We should do the same for our most valuable asset: the minds of our youngest citizens."}
{"text": "BERLIN  Guido Westerwelle, who served as Germanys first openly gay foreign minister and kept his country out of NATOs intervention in Libya, died on Friday in Cologne. He was 54.His foundation and the German government announced his death. The cause was complications of leukemia, which was diagnosed in 2014.Mr. Westerwelle was a former leader of the Free Democratic Party, which governed in a coalition with the Christian Democratic Union of Chancellor Angela Merkel until the party suffered a crushing defeat in the 2013 elections.He was the highest-ranking openly gay person in the German government, having risen to the position of vice chancellor. As foreign minister from 2009 to 2013, he had the uncomfortable task of visiting countries where homosexuality is not accepted, or even legal.We have lost a man who has dominated our country for a generation  as party leader of the F.D.P., as opposition leader and then as foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who preceded and succeeded Mr. Westerwelle as foreign minister, said in a statement.Secretary of State John Kerry in a statement called Mr. Westerwelle a champion of democracy and human rights and lauded him for speaking out on extrajudicial detentions, visiting Syrian refugees in the Zaatari refugee camp, and meeting with Ukrainian protesters in Kiev.For most of Germanys postwar history, the Free Democrats  a liberal party that stood for lower taxes and more efficient government  were the kingmakers in the countrys politics, entering partnerships with either the Christian Democrats or the Social Democrats to form stable governments.The Free Democrats made surprising gains in the 2009 federal elections and joined the Christian Democrats after Ms. Merkels first four years in power as part of a grand coalition with the center left.In 2012, during the eurozone crisis, Mr. Westerwelle and Radek Sikorski, the foreign minister of Poland at the time, wrote an Op-Ed article in The New York Times calling for overhauls to strengthen the European Union.For Europe to be a truly strong actor and global leader, it needs a strong institutional setup, a streamlined and efficient system for the separation of powers, they wrote. It also needs a directly elected European Commission president who personally appoints the members of his European Government, a European Parliament with the powers to initiate legislation and a second chamber for member states.Mr. Westerwelle was born in Bad Honnef, near the West German capital, Bonn, on Dec. 27, 1961. He joined the Free Democratic Party in 1980 and led the partys youth organization as a law student at the University of Bonn.Mr. Westerwelle became general secretary of his party in December 1994, days before his 33rd birthday, and entered Parliament in 1996. He was elected party chairman in 2001 and held that office until 2011.In 2002, he began what he called a Fun Campaign, canvassing Germany in a bright yellow bus called the Guidomobile. His party fell far short of its goal of 18 percent of the vote  it earned less than half that  but he went on to serve a prominent role in the opposition, earning respect for his sharp, witty style of debate.His vindication came in 2009, when he led the Free Democrats to their best result ever in parliamentary elections, ending an 11-year-old spell in opposition. It was the high point of his career.It is traditional for the second party in a German coalition to get control of the foreign ministry, and so Mr. Westerwelle, as leader of the Free Democrats, took charge.He occasionally found that his skills as an opposition politician were not the same as those needed for the nations top diplomat. (He was derided by some reporters when, at his first official news conference, he declined to take a question in English.)But over time Mr. Westerwelle grew into the role, earning respect as he held to Germanys postwar tradition of cultural openness combined with military restraint.This contributed to Germanys opposition to NATOs intervention in Libya. There was little appetite  either in Ms. Merkels government or among the public  for Germany to play a part. But Mr. Westerwelle and others who opposed the action in Libya still found themselves targets of foreign criticism, even when the turmoil in Libya bolstered critics of the original intervention.Mr. Westerwelle always said his great model was Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a veteran Free Democrat foreign minister who helped oversee Germanys reunification in 1990.In November, Mr. Westerwelle made a characteristically determined attempt to return to public life, giving a series of television interviews and publishing a book, Between Two Lives: Of Love, Death and Confidence. Shortly afterward, however, he entered the University Clinic in Cologne. He did not leave.Mr. Westerwelle is survived by his husband, Michael Mronz. We are thankful for an unbelievably great time together, the two men wrote in a statement that the Westerwelle Foundation for International Understanding released on Friday. The love remains."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON   The White House will nominate Gen. Lori J. Robinson of the Air Force to lead all military forces in North America, Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter said Friday. If confirmed by the Senate, General Robinson will become the first woman to head one of the United States combatant commands.We have coming along now a lot of female officers who are exceptionally strong, Mr. Carter said in an interview with Politico. Lori certainly fits into that category.The Defense Department has six combatant commanders who oversee military operations in different regions of the world.General Robinson would lead the United States Northern Command, which is based in Colorado Springs and was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to coordinate the militarys response to domestic threats. The highest-profile command in recent years has been the United States Central Command, which oversees military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq and the rest of the Middle East.Mr. Carter made the announcement as the Pentagon moves forward with a series of measures designed to create greater gender equality in the military and make the services more appealing to women.In December, Mr. Carter announced that the Pentagon would open all combat roles to women. Then in January, he announced that he was expanding maternity leave and said the Pentagon would begin a pilot program that would pay for women to have their eggs frozen to encourage them to stay in the military during their 20s and 30s, a time when many leave after giving birth.According to figures compiled by the Pentagon, a little more than 6 percent of generals and admirals are women; 17 percent of officers are women; and 15 percent of enlisted service members are women. Out of 38 four-star generals and admirals, there are three women, including General Robinson, according to the Pentagon.Since 2014, General Robinson has been based at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam in Hawaii, where she has been the commander over Air Force operations in the Pacific."}
{"text": "For true Swarovski fans, a trip to China means more than visiting the Forbidden City or walking along a portion of the Great Wall.The company is selling its fine jewelry line only in China, where the 18-karat gold diamond swans, amethyst hearts and pink-sapphire blossoms sell for prices ranging from 6,800 renminbi to 43,000 renminbi, or $1,045 to $6,600. The line recently was added to its boutique at the glitzy Venetian Macau hotel and casino, bringing the total number of sales sites to 20.China is a key market for us. However, at present this market is mainly driven by fine jewelry, said Nadja Swarovski, head of corporate communications and design services and a member of the companys executive board.Swarovski is well known as the worlds largest supplier of crystals for fashion design and jewelry. For example, earlier this year Versace used more than 260,000 of its crystals for the costumes that Jennifer Lopez is wearing in her new Las Vegas show, and 75,000 more for the shows set.But the company also has a gemstone business, founded in 1965, which provides sapphires, topaz, citrines and other stones to jewelers.The fine jewelry line, introduced in 2012, made its debut in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Two years later, the company tested a series of collections and sales sites in the United States, including the Jeweled Garden collection designed by the sculptor and jeweler Matthew Campbell Laurenza and sold exclusively at Bergdorf Goodman.In the end, the decision was made to focus on fashion jewelry in the United States and fine jewelry in Asia.Fine jewelry represents a tremendous opportunity, Ms. Swarovski said. It is a huge market and is growing extremely fast, especially in Asia."}
{"text": "MONTCLAIR, N.J.  This is not, for the record, the same old Krapp. The chalk-faced, squealing, macabre dandy who has materialized at the Alexander Kasser Theater at Montclair State University bears scant resemblance to the classically grizzled figure weve come to associate with the title character of Krapps Last Tape, Samuel Becketts 1958 assessment of a life from the vantage point of its weary end.How best to describe this upstart avatar of Becketts bleakly comic worldview? Dr. Seusss curmudgeonly Grinch, impersonating a Kabuki warlord, comes to mind. But then so does an angry Marcel Marceau, with perhaps a touch of Divine, the cross-dressing John Waters superstar.Oh, heck. Suffice it to say that in this offering from the Peak Performances program, Krapp is portrayed by that exacting master of the avant-garde masque, Robert Wilson. If you know the work of Mr. Wilson  who several years ago transformed Mikhail Baryshnikov and Willem Dafoe into cryptic, interchangeable vaudeville clowns in The Old Woman  you should get the picture.And if you think such an image doesnt tally with your idea of a Beckett hero, well, its healthy to have your preconceptions of art shaken up every now and then. The seeming mismatch of Mr. Krapp (surely we can allow the old souse the dignity of the rare honorific) and Mr. Wilson offers intriguing glimpses into the characters of both.Originally conceived by Beckett as a radio play for the sonorous voice of the Northern Irish actor Patrick Magee, Krapp has now been showing up on stages for half a century, contemplating his 69 years on this muckball of a planet as he listens to a tape of his 39-year-old self. He has been incarnated by the estimable likes of Michael Gambon, Corin Redgrave, Brian Dennehy, Harold Pinter and John Hurt, who almost always appear in a state of advanced (and realistic) decrepitude, crouched darkly over a dusty desk.None of that for Mr. Wilson, one of contemporarys cultures leading proponents of artifice for artifices sake. As director and designer, he has reconceived Krapps Last Tape, which runs only through Sunday, as a Gothic tone poem that transforms the plays subtext into exaggeratedly graphic images.For starters, theres the color palette of severe yet spectral black and white. This approach is not out of line with its authors vision. Writing in 1960 to the director Alan Schneider, Beckett summed up the plays governing pattern as black and white (both dirty), the whole piece being built up in one sense on this simple antithesis.Mr. Wilson takes this advice to its literal extremes, with the caveat that he doesnt do dirty. The room Krapp inhabits suggests a pristine bureaucratic prison, a cool variation on the haunted corridors of the Expressionist silent film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari.There are high rectangular windows and long, low tables stacked with sheaves of paper and filing boxes. The tape recorder, which Krapp regards as his admonishing enemy and bosom buddy, is white and curved. His foppish funereal clothes (designed by Yashi) are black and white, of course, with the disruptive accent of red socks.The air, as you much as you can see air (and, come to think of it, you can chez Wilson), is inky black. It is pierced by the whitest light youve ever seen (A. J. Weissbard is the lighting designer), which in the long, astonishing opening sequence takes the form of slashing rain, accompanied by pounding thunder. You may find yourself thinking of those dark and stormy cinematic nights on which mad scientists begot monsters.In that context, Mr. Wilsons Krapp, first seen sitting immobile and inhuman at his desk, could be said to be both sides of the equation. This man, who keeps such copious written and audio files on his life, is the monster he has made of himself.When he finally rises, he strikes poses that range from the mock-Promethean (as he shakes a fist at the thunder) to the balletically comic, in the manner of Chaplin or Keaton. When he extracts a banana (Krapps favorite food) from the drawer of a filing cabinet, he brandishes it as if it were a gun. (Or is he just happy to see us?) He eats it as if he were an unusually methodical ape.In any case, hes not quite human. Listening to his younger self (talking about his younger self) on the recorder, he belches out mechanical yowls and growls. Sometimes he disappears into the dark, and we hear the sounds of corks uncorking and liquor gurgling from a bottle.Instead of shuffling arthritically, as most Krapps do, he waddles with undulating hips. Sometimes he dances, rather in the manner of the tutu-clad hippopotami in Walt Disneys Fantasia.In other words, Mr. Wilsons Krapp wears his rue  and his vanity  with a difference, and theres something affecting in this softening of the physical dimensions of memory. Becketts words  those priceless words  count for rather less in this production than they usually do and should.But as a visual exercise, this Krapps Last Tape assumes its own melancholy poetry that is in keeping with Becketts affinity for the pratfall-deflated pretenses of music-hall clowns. And you surely wont soon forget the sight of Mr. Wilsons burned-out case trying to trip the dark fantastic one more time."}
{"text": "LONDON  Steinhoff International Holdings of South Africa said on Friday that it had abandoned its pursuit of the Home Retail Group as a potentially lengthy bidding war loomed and instead agreed to acquire the French electronics and appliance retailer Darty.The decision to walk away came as a deadline approached on Friday for Steinhoff and J Sainsbury, one of Britains largest grocery store chains, to make formal bids for the Home Retail Group, which is based in Britain.British takeover regulators said on Thursday that if one of the companies made a formal offer for Home Retail on Friday that the competing bidder would be granted an automatic 53-day extension to respond.On Friday, Steinhoff said that it would not announce an offer for Home Retail and had instead agreed to acquire Darty for 673 million pounds, or about $965 million.Steinhoff said it would seek to combine Darty with Conforama, a French household goods retailer it bought five years ago.The offer represents an attractive opportunity for both companies to develop their combined footprint, particularly in France, through an expanded offering of household goods and complementary products for the end consumer, Alexandre Nodale, the Conforama chief executive, said in a news release.Darty said its board would recommend that shareholders accept the offer from Steinhoff, which outbid Groupe Fnac of France for the company.News that Steinhoff was ending its pursuit sent shares of Home Retail down 11 percent in late afternoon trading in London on Friday.On Feb. 2, J Sainsbury said that it had agreed on the terms of a bid to buy Home Retail in a cash-and-stock deal that would value the acquired company at 1.3 billion.A few weeks later, Home Retail said that Steinhoff had approached it with a possible all-cash takeover offer that would value the company at about 1.4 billion, setting up a potential bidding war.After Fridays announcement, J Sainsbury made a formal bid for Home Retail under essentially the same terms as its original agreement.J Sainsbury said that it now expected to achieve at least 160 million in cost savings in the third year after the deal closed, up from its original estimate of 120 million.This combination with H.R.G. presents an opportunity to accelerate our strategy, delivering compelling revenue and cost synergies, David Tyler, the J Sainsbury chairman, said in a news release. We will create a multiproduct, multichannel proposition with fast delivery networks that we believe will be very attractive to the customers of both businesses.Home Retail is the owner of Argos, which sells electronics, housewares and other products through its online operations and retail stores in Britain and Ireland.The company agreed in January to sell Homebase, a British home improvement chain, to Wesfarmers Limited of Australia for 340 million."}
{"text": "Jets General Manager Mike Maccagnan played down Robert Griffin IIIs recent two-day visit and used a conference call with reporters on Friday to repeatedly stress the teams desire to re-sign the free-agent quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick.We feel we have a good situation here for Ryan, and hes a very good fit for us, Maccagnan said. Our goal is to try to get Ryan under contract.Last Friday and Saturday, the Jets hosted Griffin, a former Heisman Trophy winner whose fortunes soured with the Washington Redskins after a stellar rookie season. Maccagnan said he had not been in contact with Griffin since the quarterbacks Pro Day at Baylor. Maccagnan described the extended time the oft-injured Griffin had spent at the teams complex in Florham Park, N.J., as more of a meet and greet.In answering a question about Griffin, Maccagnan noted, Our focus primarily is trying to get something worked out with Ryan.That has been far more difficult than either side could have anticipated after Fitzpatrick, 33, expressed a desire to remain with the Jets at the end of a surprising 10-6 regular season and after Coach Todd Bowles had made it equally clear that he would like to have him back.Fitzpatricks age and journeyman background  the Jets were his sixth team  have made the Jets and other quarterback-needy teams wary of making a major financial commitment to him, even after he set career highs by throwing for 3,905 yards and a team-record 31 touchdowns. He also provided needed leadership and possesses an excellent understanding of the system orchestrated by the offensive coordinator Chan Gailey. Fitzpatrick did well under him before, when the two worked together with the Buffalo Bills.Fitzpatrick has been hurt by interceptions throughout his career. Although he avoided costly pickoffs for much of the 2015 season and was intercepted only 15 times, three of those contributed significantly to the Jets 22-17 loss at Buffalo in the regular-season finale. The Jets would have advanced to the playoffs for the first time since the 2010 season by winning that game.To further complicate matters, the Jets have little room to maneuver, even under a salary cap that rose to $155.7 million. The franchise spent heavily last year in Maccagnans first off-season as general manager. Maccagnan noted that the current market had exploded at many positions, including quarterback. The unproven Chase Daniel, for instance, recently received a three-year deal worth $21 million from the Philadelphia Eagles.It was a market flush with cash, Maccagnan said. A lot of teams had a lot of room under the cap to spare. A lot of people are getting deals above what some teams anticipated.It has been widely reported that the Jets are offering Fitzpatrick about $7 million per year. The proposed deal is thought to be close to what Daniel was given, even though Daniel lacks Fitzpatricks rsum. So does Brock Osweiler, 25, who left the Denver Broncos to join the Houston Texans for a four-year contract totaling $72 million.Fitzpatrick may be forced to settle for far less than what he believes constitutes his market value if no suitors arise beyond the Jets. Hopefully we can find a middle ground were both happy with, Maccagnan said.It is unclear how the Jets will create more room to maneuver under the cap. One possibility would be to cut the veteran tackle DBrickashaw Ferguson, who counts for $14.1 million against the cap.Right now, Id say he will be on our roster going forward, Maccagnan said. But well see how this thing unfolds.Cap room could also come from trading the defensive line stalwart Muhammad Wilkerson, whose franchise tag is worth $15.7 million. But Maccagnan said the possibility of dealing Wilkerson was not something were actively pursuing.He also addressed the news that cornerback Darrelle Revis had undergone surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right wrist. Revis will be in a hard cast for the next two to three months and will be limited in his participation in the off-season program. Maccagnan said the Jets had been unaware of a problem with Reviss wrist until recently and had therefore not listed him on their weekly injury report during the regular season."}
{"text": "In just 10 years, the Parisian jewelry house Messika has shaken up the industry, with its rebellious, rock n roll designs, earning A-list fans such as Cara Delevingne, Beyonc, Alicia Vikander, Kendall Jenner and Kate Winslet.Now a book by the luxury publisher Assouline celebrates the first decade of the diamond company. Written by the jewelry historian Vivienne Becker, the 80-page Messika (assouline.com, $22), includes 45 illustrations and is peppered with quotes from the founder and creative director, Valrie Messika.The daughter of a renowned diamond dealer, who still provides nearly all of her stones, Ms. Messika said the book was a chance to reflect. As a businesswoman, I make projections every day about the future. I dont get to look back so much, she said. The book helped me see why Messika has had this success  and see how we have, in our small way, changed the jewelry business.The book opens with the houses history and what has made Ms. Messikas design-driven ideas so revolutionary: She lifted the heavy notions of heirloom, etiquette, and formality from the diamond, to set it free.The three-diamond Move design was the houses debut and an instant hit, with more than 200,000 pieces sold since 2007. It was followed by other successes, such as the Skinny, a now-patented technology of nano springs that makes gem settings flexible, the opening of a boutique on the Rue St.-Honor in Paris, and the introduction of a fine jewelry line three years ago.If the first chapter looks into the house, the following steps out, examining why the diamond was so ripe for rebellion. Its here where Ms. Becker creates a historical context around the stone for a new confident fashion-conscious generation, looking for a unique expression of individuality.The diamonds metamorphosis is a subject of intense interest to Ms. Becker. We are going through an interesting time in terms of the democratization of the diamond, she said from her home in London. That is really fascinating socially, culturally and design-wise.The book concludes with the hallmarks of Messikas style, most notably its fine jewelry pieces that include the Cravate Silk diamond and gold-mesh necklace that took 5,000 hours of work, and a choker featuring a 60-carat cushion-cut yellow diamond. The brand had to gain credibility in this highly specialized sector, the book quotes Ms. Messika as saying. But it is part of my legacy."}
{"text": "RUINED CITYBy Jia PingwaTranslated by Howard Goldblatt520 pp. University of Oklahoma, paper, $24.95.The Chinese title of this sprawling novel, Feidu, means abandoned capital. It refers not to Beijing but to Jia Pingwas hometown, Xian, called Changan when it was the political and spiritual center of the Tang dynasty. In its time possibly the largest and most cosmopolitan city in the world, Xian (Xijing in the novel) has, in Jias description, become a dilapidated backwater by the 1980s. Ruined City, newly translated by Howard Goldblatt, concerns the careers of a small group of local writers, and their friends, publishers and lovers (sometimes all three at once). Zhuang Zhidie, the protagonist, is a freethinker and libertine who seems driven to sleep with women more out of curiosity than lust, and the books many elaborate descriptions of sex  which caused the novel to be banned in China for 17 years  have a detached and clinical air, the feeling of a deliberate provocation for the censors rather than a celebration of Eros for its own sake.Far more resonant than the sex is Jias pervading nostalgia for the Chinese past, embodied in the novels episodic, wandering, seemingly plot-indifferent structure  a series of what seem to be very similar incidents and encounters, meals, conversations, sexual escapades, minor scandals and subdued confrontations, which only by very slow degrees add up to any sense of narrative progress. Like some of the classics of Chinese literature  The Water Margin, Journey to the West, The Dream of the Red Chamber, The Scholars  Ruined City has to be appreciated for its small pleasures as much as its larger themes: Its a grab bag of techniques and vantage points, from the loving description of a living room filled with furniture imported from Hong Kong (a rare sight in the 1980s) to a passage seen from the perspective of a cow.Ruined City is notable for its almost complete indifference to its historical moment. While the Cultural Revolution is referred to in places, its clear that Jia wants his characters to seem neither traumatized by nor interested in politics. They live in a tiny world of their own making and seem  like artists everywhere  to thrive on lifes small dissatisfactions. That may be the novels most shocking quality of all.BEIJING COMRADESBy Bei TongTranslated by Scott E. Myers383 pp. Feminist Press, paper, $16.95.Perhaps the best-known work to arise from Chinas gay, or comrade, literature (tongzhi wenxue) movement in the 1990s, Beijing Comrades (or Beijing Story) elicited enormous admiration  and outrage  when it was published online. It has never appeared in print in mainland China, and the authors true identity has never been established. Which is no surprise: The novels extreme candor extends from its long and unabashed sex scenes to its matter-of-fact descriptions of the Tiananmen massacre and the rise of the princeling economy, in which the sons and daughters of elite Communist Party cadres built state-protected business empires in the 1980s and 90s, establishing much of the oligarchy that controls China today.Beijing Comrades is a familiar, almost archetypal love story: Chen Handong, a princeling in his late 20s, possessed of enormous wealth and almost equally enormous sexual appetites, loses his heart to Lan Yu, an alluring teenager who has maneuvered his way into college in Beijing, even though he comes from an impoverished family in remote northwestern China. Not content with the conventionally discreet existence of a Chinese gay man, Handong buys a house in the suburbs, where he hopes he and Lan Yu can build a new life together; eventually, however, his family discovers his secret and, his happiness sabotaged, he finds himself driven to marry a manipulative, selfish woman. After a short while Handongs marriage ends in a pitiless divorce, and he manages to find Lan Yu again, but their hard-earned contentment is short-lived.Beijing Comrades (which was made into a film, Lan Yu, by the Hong Kong director Stanley Kwan in 2001) has lingered in the margins far too long. Scott E. Myerss translation demonstrates that its one of the most significant Chinese novels of our time.HALF A LIFELONG ROMANCEBy Eileen ChangTranslated by Karen S. Kingsbury379 pp. Anchor, paper, $16.Originally published in 1950 as Eighteen Springs and both revised and retitled 18 years later, Half a Lifelong Romance is the most mature and fully achieved novel by the midcentury writer Eileen Chang, whose work was beloved by readers in Hong Kong and Taiwan, yet banned in mainland China until the 1990s. Somewhat mysteriously, its also the only one of her novels she herself did not adapt into English. Chang, also known as Zhang Ailing, was born in Shanghai to an aristocratic family in 1920 and moved back and forth between China and Hong Kong during the chaotic years of her young adulthood, finally settling in the United States in the 1950s. She drew equally on Chinese and Western novels for inspiration and considered her work to be a hybrid.Half a Lifelong Romance, translated by Karen S. Kingsbury, takes place in Shanghai in the years leading up to World War II, when the city was flush with overseas investment and cosmopolitan panache. Unlike Changs famously lurid story of spies and seductresses, Lust, Caution  the basis for the Ang Lee movie  this novel is set among ordinary residents of the city whose lives are hemmed in by rigid social constraints and Confucian reserve. Shen Shijun, a young engineer, falls in love with Gu Manzhen, a beautiful, gentle, sincere young woman employed at the same textile factory. But because Manzhens sister once worked as a taxi dancer and prostitute, Shijuns family rejects her and he marries someone else. Manzhen then enters into her own unfortunate marriage. When they finally meet again, many years later, they can only acknowledge the sequence of slights, errors and miscalculations that doomed their relationship almost from the start.Somewhat less atmospheric than Changs other work, Half a Lifelong Romance is a small masterpiece of understatement and indirection. It has a grave tenderness, alert to the manners and gestures of bourgeois family life, almost reminiscent of Henry James or Edith Wharton. Its an excellent introduction to the complex work of an underappreciated writer."}
{"text": "Alma Thomas (1891-1978) was born in Georgia, educated in Washington and worked as an art teacher in the public schools there for almost 40 years. During this time, she pursued a parallel career as a painter, participating in Lois Mailou Joness salon for African-American artists and studying with Jacob Kainen at American University.When she retired from teaching at 69, she became a full-time artist,producing bright-colored paintings in a loosely brushed, mosaic-like style. The work was abstract but was inspired by the world around her: the trees and flowers of her Washington neighborhood and the music in its streets. In 1972, she had a solo show at the Whitney Museum of American Art; one of her pictures currently hangs in the Obama White House. A retrospective is now at the Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., through June 5, and moves on to the Studio Museum in Harlem this summer.

{"text": "The author, most recently, of The Ancient Minstrel is an inveterate reader of cookbooks, including Mario Batali, Anthony Bourdain and Gabrielle Hamilton.What books are currently on your night stand?Unfortunately, I cant read novels while Im writing them because of the imitative nature of the brain. So I get along with a few European mysteries and lots of poetry.Whats the last great book you read?I reread the Selected Poems of Antonio Machado recently, after my wife died. I found it helped to study Machado, whose grave I once visited in Collioure, France, where people leave flowers and poems on his grave. I stayed in the rooming hotel where he died. I dont think this is necromancy but reverence. You do manage a somewhat religious attitude toward your art. It is a calling rather than a job. I now find myself in an occasional state of surprise that Ive made a living as a novelist for quite some time, the opposite of what I expected. It was pretty brutal up until I was 40, but then I refused to accept any of the frequently offered jobs teaching writing. I believed someone should stay outside of academia. We scraped by on occasional journalism. I had a breakthrough with the novellas called Legends of the Fall. My agent at the time said, No one has ever read novellas, but they seemed to enliven general curiosity. The most mail I ever got for a work was after I published the novella The Woman Lit by Fireflies in The New Yorker.Which writers  novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets  working today do you admire most?I read obsessively Michael Ondaatje, Louise Erdrich, Colum McCann, Sherman Alexie, Guy de la Valdene and my old friend Tom McGuane. I can read nonfiction anytime, and now on my night table is a splendid book about the Bahamas by Chris Dombrowski called Body of Water, to be published this fall by Milkweed Editions. I am also an inveterate reader of cookbooks, including Mario Batali, Anthony Bourdain and Gabrielle Hamilton, among many others.Tell us about your favorite short story.Recently I was very struck by the short stories of Lucia Berlin. Ive never been a true fan of the short story and have only published a single example of my own. In my early past, my passion was for Isak Dinesens work.And about your favorite poem.I suppose my favorite poem is ultimately Leaves of Grass, by Walt Whitman, and then my early addiction for Rimbaud and Apollinaire. (I was especially pleased when my own selected poems were published in France last year.)Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?I like nonfiction, fiction and poetry and generally avoid biography.What moves you most in a work of literature? Do you find yourself returning to certain themes as a reader?What moves me most is style, the quality of the writing rather than the story being told.Who is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? Your favorite antihero or villain?My original favorite fictional hero was Heathcliff in Bronts Wuthering Heights. (I also loved the character of Dalva, who I created.) My favorite antihero is Stavrogin in Dostoyevskys The Possessed. There are lots of villains in A Thousand Splendid Suns, by Khaled Hosseini.What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?As a child I was an obsessive reader, as was everybody in my family all winter long with my father. I think I was only 8 when I read Edward Gibbons The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. Early on in our childhood, our parents bought us the 12-volume set called My Book House, which had a great influence on me. I spoke with Robert Duncan about My Book House, who also read them early on, to his delight.Youthful reading can be a melancholy procedure. Your credibility is so forlorn you believe everything you read. Later the feeling became quite humorous. The little cripple boy drew on his cowboy boot. Unfortunately, there was a small rattlesnake in the boot, which bit and slowly killed him. His dog tried to revive him and the snake fatally bit the dog on the nose. Now there were two friends slumped in death on the porch. That sort of thing. Otherwise my faithful reading boyhood was quite pleasant, although I lost my left eye at the age of 7, when a little girl shoved a beaker in my face. This only led to harder work finding alternative realities in books. At age 21, my favorite people, my father and sister, died in an auto accident. This served to fuel me to write totally without compromise. If people you love can die in an accident, you refuse to step back from your work.What book that you read for school had the greatest impact on you?I remember in the seventh grade I did a project where I had to read all of Willa Cathers books, which were wonderful.If you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be?The King James Version of the Bible. Also the works of Dostoyevsky. I read the Bible over and over in my youth, and the Judeo-Christian sensibility focused the world for me, for better or worse. Now, at my advanced age, I wonder how we are taught to believe something, but then we fail to learn how not to believe it. I find that I still believe in the Resurrection, though I improved it somewhat in a poem:In the forty days in the wilderness Jesus took along a stray dog from town. When they got back home Jesus told the dog he had to go off to Jerusalem to get crucified. Jesus stored the dog in his tomb and after he himself was brought there they ascended into heaven together.If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?The works of Dostoyevsky, to enrich his nature.What author living or dead would you most like to meet and what would you like to know?I always wanted to meet Gabriel Garca Mrquez, who has a jubilant nature. I would wonder what made his spirit so rambunctious.Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didnt? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?I dont get very far into disappointing books before I abandon them. Life is short and brutal.Of the books youve written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful?I think that my Dalva has the greatest range. Many of my readers I hear from concur. The origin of the book came, oddly, in a dream where she is sitting on the balcony in Santa Monica, looking at the Pacific and thinking of her youth and family in the Sandhills of Nebraska, a beautiful but largely unknown area. With Dalva, I got to establish my own universe. At the time, in my 30s, I largely misunderstood women, and it was time to catch up.Who would you want to write your life story?Myself, the only possible writer!What do you plan to read next?No plans. Im waiting for what comes along."}

{"text": "RE: BORDER PATROLMark Binelli wrote about Jos Antonio Elena Rodrguez, a Mexican teenager shot 10 times from behind by a United States Border Patrol agent standing on American soil.Jos Antonios killing was certainly beyond the pale. An unarmed Mexican 16-year-old was killed by an American law-enforcement agent. He was defenseless. As heinous as the actions of his killer were, though, the greater injury has been inflicted by the agencies of the United States government that have until recently protected him and excused his actions.I cannot imagine that the United States Border Patrol would agree that confusing jurisdictions and arcane legal arguments should protect members of drug cartels who hide in Mexico and shoot our officers from across the border. I cannot imagine that the citizens of any American border town would tolerate Mexican police officers firing across the border and killing its citizens. Yet our failure to act immediately against agents like Lonnie Ray Swartz, who was accused of killing Jos Antonio, condones similar behavior.Unjustified police shootings, clandestine C.I.A. torture and Border Patrol atrocities are creating 320 million victims each time they occur. Each and every American dies a little with each act.Ken H., posted on nytimes.comFrom this side of the border, it does seem that Border Patrol agents can use excessive force with impunity. It is somewhat reassuring that there are officials like James Tomsheck trying to investigate and thereby discourage Customs and Border Protections excessive use of force. But it is also troubling when their efforts are stymied.I understand that a transborder shooting may raise jurisdictional issues. However, while it is greatly admirable that the United States judicial system has taken up this case, I am somewhat surprised that the Mexican government hasnt taken greater action against the United States.When an agent of the United States shoots and kills an unarmed boy across an international border, that should be considered an act of war.If a pattern emerges of unpunished excessive use of transborder force and nothing can be achieved through bilateral diplomatic pressure, then perhaps the government of Mexico should seek redress at an international forum.Ponderer, Mexico City, posted on nytimes.comRE: SPY VS. SPYAlex French investigated an attempt to bring down a Fox News analyst, Wayne Simmons, who claimed to be a former C.I.A. operative.Kent Clizbe has self-published two books, each chalking up the rise of political correctness to either the K.G.B. or President Obama, or possibly both. On his blog, he writes: [Obamas] political handlers, his political career, his political rhetoric, are models of Socialist/Communist methods. In 2008, he warned of a coming crackdown by Obama on behalf of climate change that would return us to horse-and-buggy days. He makes sure to tell us that 2008 is the coldest year in decades, so, of course, climate change cannot possibly be true. Its all a plot.Were supposed to take him seriously? Why did The New York Times Magazine publish this article without some critical analysis of what Clizbes own agenda might be? Id sure like to know what he was up to by outing Simmons, who may well be the fraud that Clizbe paints him to be, but theres something else going on there.Annie, posted on nytimes.comI eagerly read the article, anticipating the exposure of a Fox News talking head as a fraud. The evidence was indeed convincing, and Clizbe did an admirable job of digging up the truth. However, when I came to the end of the article, I was left with unanswered questions and a slightly different take on Wayne Simmons. Did he undergo any psychiatric tests? He appears to be suffering from delusions of some sort. I cannot understand how his son and daughter would allow him to be interviewed on his own. I am certain there is more to the story and will watch for updates. As always, I am happy to see Fox News exposed.Susan Nestler, Towson, Md.Send your thoughts to magazine@nytimes.com."}
{"text": "ST. LOUIS   After Syracuse beat Dayton, 70-51, on Friday, several of the Oranges coaches watched the Midwest Region game between No. 15-seeded Middle Tennessee State and No. 2-seeded Michigan State at Scottrade Center. They knew they would be playing the winner.And so when Middle Tennessee State won, setting up a matchup Sunday against Syracuse, Griff Hopkins, the adolescent son of the Syracuse assistant Mike Hopkins, turned to another Syracuse assistant, Adrian Autry, and said, Its going to be a long night.After all, No. 10-seeded Syracuse (20-13) could not possibly have already prepared for a team that had just pulled off one of the biggest upsets in N.C.A.A. history. Right?Wrong.No, man, its done, Autry told Griff Hopkins.The N.C.A.A. tournament requires teams that win their first game to play again with just a day of preparation. Losing means an end to your season.Which is why, when the bracket came out last Sunday, Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim assigned one assistant to scout Michigan State and another  Autry  to begin to prepare for the Blue Raiders (25-9).We come in and both guys prepare like were going to play that team, up until the games over, Boeheim said Saturday.To Boeheim and Autry, the practice seemed as natural as breathing.When a fan hears a coach or a player say that a team is just taking it one game at a time or that a competitor was a really good team, with weapons that can beat you, an eye roll is all but a reflex.But as Syracuse prepares to play a team that few people outside Murfreesboro, Tenn., expected would be playing in the tournaments second round  and probably few in that town, near Nashville  it is worth considering that coaches repeat those truisms because they believe them.Autry said he did not see scouting Middle Tennessee State as a moot assignment last Sunday night.I went upstairs, got right back on the computer and just started getting after it, he said.What he found was what the rest of the world saw in Middle Tennessee States 90-81 victory over the Spartans: The Blue Raiders, this seasons Conference USA champion, were for real.After Day 2 or Day 3 of watching tape, I said, You know what? This team  the seeding may be a little off,  Autry said.Boeheim, too, seemed to have figured this out. I had talked to a pro scout, he said, and he had told me, and some people had told him, that this was a very, very good team. And when you watch them play, its pretty obvious.As evidenced in their 55.9 field-goal percentage against Michigan States stout defense, the Blue Raiders have several sharpshooters. On defense, they are aggressive and deploy multiple looks.Weve played against all those defenses, Autry said, but, he added, I dont think weve played against a team that actually plays all those defenses in one game.Doyin Akintobi-Adeyeye, a reserve sophomore forward for the Orange, compared Middle Tennessee States physical defense to Pittsburghs and likened its penchant for 3-pointers to Florida States. Syracuse went 1-4 against Pittsburgh and Florida State, Atlantic Coast Conference rivals, including in the conference tournament.We just pay attention to everybody, Akintobi-Adeyeye said. You have to respect everybody. It is the tournament."}
{"text": "After his rallies in Arizona this weekend were marked by protests and violence, Donald J. Trump on Sunday complained of a double standard in coverage of those incidents and defended his campaign manager after video showed the manager grabbing a demonstrator by the collar and yanking him backward during a rally in Tucson.The Tucson rally included one of the most violent confrontations yet at a Trump appearance, when a protester being escorted out of the arena by the police was sucker-punched, knocked to the ground and repeatedly pounded and kicked by a Trump supporter.Asked about the incident on ABCs This Week, Mr. Trump allowed that the beating was a tough thing to watch, but he refused to condemn the assault. He offered harsher words for the victim, saying he had been accompanied by another protester provocatively wearing a Ku Klux Klan costume.At what point do people blame the protesters? he said, calling them professional agitators.Mr. Trump also complained about a roadblock by protesters who sought to prevent his supporters from reaching a rally outside Phoenix on Sunday.I think its very unfair that these, really, in many cases professional, in many cases sick, protesters can put cars in a road blocking thousands of great Americans from coming to a speech, and nobody says anything about that, Mr. Trump said, adding: Its a very unfair double standard.Mr. Trump was also questioned about a video showing his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, accosting a demonstrator in Tucson. Mr. Lewandowski was seen grabbing the protester by his collar and, along with someone who appeared to be a plainclothed security guard, yanking him backwards. According to CBS News, the protester was part of a group of people who had stood behind Mr. Trump and jeered him as he spoke.I give him credit for having spirit, Mr. Trump said of Mr. Lewandowski, adding that the protesters had been holding horrible, profanity-laden signs in the background as television cameras recorded his speech. He said Mr. Lewandowski was trying to remove the signs from view.Mr. Trump added that police officers and security guards in the Tucson arena had been a little bit lax.But other Republican leaders, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate majority leader, suggested Sunday that Mr. Trump should do more to calm his crowds.Reince Priebus, the Republican national chairman, said it was a mistake for a campaign aide to get physical with protesters: As far as everyone getting involved in the crowds, leave it to the professionals, he said on This Week.Mr. McConnell, for his part, urged stronger condemnation of violence at campaign events. I think all the candidates for president ought to be discouraging that kind of activity because the people in the audience tend to listen to those who are speaking, he said on This Week, adding: We ought to condemn this kind of violence and encourage the American people to engage in this political debate in a respectful way.Asked on CNNs State of the Union about the prospect that Mr. Trump could wind up as the Republican presidential candidate in November, Mr. McConnell would not directly address what it might mean for retaining the majority, his top priority for the fall. But he indicated that the partys Senate candidates would be free to distance themselves from Mr. Trump.Senate races are statewide races, he said. You can craft your own message for your own people. And thats exactly what we intend to do this fall, no matter who the nominee is."}
{"text": "This interview with Aaron Bell, C.E.O. of AdRoll, an online advertising placement firm, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant.Q. Tell me about your early years.A. I grew up near Seattle in Bellevue, and I was a precocious, nerdy kid drawn to computers at an early age. I started playing around with programs and creating my own games. Eventually my neighbor took notice of me. He had a software company, and they developed Christmas software, with screen savers and games.So I was a Jewish boy creating a Santas workshop and games where you fly reindeer around. I loved it. My dad would pick me up after middle school and drive me to work in Redmond nearby.In a bit of serendipity, Microsoft was two blocks down the street. And they were hungry for engineers, gobbling up talent whenever they could find it. They started pulling people from my neighbors company to work for Microsoft. And as more people left, I took on more responsibility at this software company. Pretty soon, I was leading the Christmas software project. I was 14 years old.As the people I worked with went to Microsoft, they then told the company about me, and suddenly I was interviewing at Microsoft when I was 16. They asked programming questions, but they also asked interview questions like How do you know the light goes off in the refrigerator when you close the door?I had a baby sister, so I said, I would put my baby sister in the refrigerator and then pull her out and check the dilation of her eyes. They said, Thats morbid, but its pretty clever, and they hired me.I spent about six years at Microsoft. I was able to work it out with my high school where classes would end at noon for me and then Id go to Microsoft and try to stay within the labor laws for hours worked. During the summers, I would transition to intern and take advantage of those programs.I did manage to spend some time with Bill Gates. Every summer he would have a barbecue for the interns. After being there for so many summers, I figured out the pattern. He would come out of his house and go right to the dinner line. So I would wait by the door, and when he came out, Id get in the dinner line with him. That way, Id get to sit next to him, too.Tell me about the culture of your company now.I have this overall philosophy that a company is like a human body, which builds up toxins over time. Every company has problems and issues that build up, and you need to find outlets for those things.I think a lot about how you come up with different practices in the company that are a kind of cleanse. So we do a weekly all-hands meeting, and its a weekly flush to get the toxins out.Before our all-hands meetings, I send out an email with a question-and-answer board and I encourage people to post their questions. You can vote up your favorite questions, and theyre anonymous.If you give someone a mask, theyll tell you the truth. I also encourage people to post their fears, their uncertainties and doubts. And theres a guarantee that any question that is asked will get answered or addressed by me, unless they are personal in nature about someone in particular.The alternative, if you dont do that, is that you have people behind closed doors chatting about the company, gossiping, saying negative things.If you address everything, people feel much more trust. They feel like they know whats happening. And theyre going to make better decisions because they know whats going on.What else?After youve been at AdRoll for six months, you have to write a letter to yourself as a new employee about what you wish you had known and had been taught. Then we compile those, and new hires get a 100-page book of these letters. It encourages people to really help each other out.How do you hire? What questions do you ask?Theres no silver bullet question, but I usually advise my employees to ask themselves about the person theyre interviewing: What is the No. 1 thing youre worried about? When you leave the interview, what are you going to be thinking about or wondering about?Then I tell them to spend all their time drilling into that one area. Keep asking questions. Its O.K. to prod during interviews.I also like to look at transitions between jobs, because thats a time when someone kind of popped their head up and said, This isnt working for me. Either they got fired or it was mutually not working or there is some other explanation, but Ill try to get the real story of what happened.For a company at our stage of growth, Id also say its really important to find people who are interested in building something great, rather than people who are interested in joining something great. So having people who care is a big thing.So how do you tell the drivers from the riders?In those transitions on their rsum, you can understand a lot of things. If they talk about problems at a previous company, then the question is, Were you part of the solution or are you just complaining about it?What career advice do you give to new college grads?I definitely suggest people work for early stage or midstage companies because youre going to learn a lot more. I try to steer them away from larger companies. The company is going through more change at smaller companies, and you tend to be in a deeper end of the pool where things are going to get done. So its just more of an extension of college. Theres accelerated learning in that period."}
{"text": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.   For many avid baseball fans, traveling to Arizona or Florida to watch their favorite teams during spring training is a distinctive way to break up the winter, and something that can often be done more than once.For Marc Gold, however, it has been a lifes pursuit that finally became a reality on Friday when he visited the Mets spring training camp for the first time.Its the pure enjoyment of it, Gold, 68, said while watching Noah Syndergaard throw a bullpen session before turning to use his cellphone to record video of Jacob deGrom taking batting practice. Its not like I have to think about all the stuff I had to do.The stuff was preparing, shipping and selling horseradish and other condiments to supermarkets around the country. For decades, he and his brothers, cousins, uncles and parents have helped run the family business, which makes Golds Horseradish.In the horseradish business, the busiest time of the year is late winter and early spring, leading to the Jewish Passover holiday. So while other Mets fans found time to slip away to Florida for spring training, Gold, always dutiful, was at the familys factory, first in Brooklyn and later on Long Island, trying to keep up with demand.Every February and March, other Mets fans could wander from practice field to practice field here, watching their favorite Mets players up close or just checking out young prospects with uniform numbers approaching 100. (Who is that guy, anyway?) Gold always dreamed of joining them. But he never did.He always would talk about the nice weather and how great it must be to sit around and just watch baseball, said Golds son, Shaun. We always would say, Next year in spring training, just like, Next year in Jerusalem.Gold has lived and died with the Mets from their inception, in 1962. Growing up in the Canarsie section of Brooklyn, he followed the Dodgers of Campanella, Reese, Robinson and Snider, the fabled Boys of Summer. Like many in the borough, he was angry and bitter when Walter OMalley moved the team to Los Angeles for the 1958 season. He was left with no one to root for. The Yankees? They might be the only team remaining in New York, but they were still the enemy.But everything changed when the Mets arrived. Then 14, Gold was hooked, even if this New York team was incredibly awful.He started a newsletter about the teams travails called Mets Maze. With a tape recorder he received for his bar mitzvah, he recorded Mets radio broadcasts, including the teams first spring training game. He rode the subway to the Polo Grounds, where he sat alone in right field keeping score as the team proceeded to lose a record 120 games in 1962.Can you imagine rooting for a team that lost 75 percent of its games? Gold asked.Sitting in his local synagogue during the High Holy Days, he would pass slips of paper with baseball trivia questions on them to Stuart Sternberg, a family friend and the current owner of the Tampa Bay Rays.He has the most amazing recall and facts, Sternberg said. Its mind-boggling.Indeed, all these years later, Gold spits out data about players like Joe Christopher, Tim Harkness and Rod Kanehl  mainstays on those early, overwhelmed Mets teams  the way the current crop of fans might obsess over Michael Confortos wins above replacement, or Matt Harveys strikeout-to-walk ratio. The only difference is that Conforto and Harvey are good.As his own children grew up, Gold often took them to Shea Stadium and then later to Citi Field. Golds Horseradish also became a Mets sponsor, so he was able to work with team executives to deliver mustard to the stadium while producing promotional bobbleheads.Yet through it all, Gold never had the time to make it to Florida.Ive always been encumbered, Gold said as he walked to a training field on Friday to watch David Wright cut off throws from the outfield.Last August, Gold Pure Food Products, which was founded by his grandparents in 1932, was sold. After more than 40 years in the business, Gold suddenly had plenty of time to watch the Mets. And suddenly, they were worth watching. Reinforcements arrived and the Mets went on a surprising run to the World Series. Whatever regrets Gold felt about the end of his career were cast aside for about three hours every night.I left the company in August and Cespedes arrived, he said, referring to Yoenis Cespedes, the slugger the Mets acquired from the Detroit Tigers at the July 31 trade deadline.This winter, Cespedes, a free agent, decided to stay with the Mets, delighting fans, like Gold, who had assumed he would sign for more money elsewhere. Meanwhile, Gold kept busy doing charity work, playing guitar and reading the newspapers. And with the demands of the horseradish business no longer hanging over him, Gold, now close to 70, decided that, yes, it was time to finally check out spring training.So here he is, in Port St. Lucie, seeing professional players up close. They are, in general, taller or stronger than they appear on television, and sometimes friendlier, too. The experience of talking to deGrom, Curtis Granderson and other players felt surreal.This is self-indulgent, Gold said at one point on Friday. I shouldnt be at a baseball game.As Gold adjusted to his surroundings, he realized that no one was going to accuse him of sneaking out of work and that after all these years he was entitled to enjoy what amounted to a fantasy camp. Deferred joy, after all, is still joy.Some of Golds best friends who watched him follow the early Mets have seen him change in recent months as he has had time to fully re-embrace the team that drove him to such distraction more than half a century ago.Hes come full circle, said Stan Fischler, a longtime hockey writer who remains a mentor to Gold. Hes 68 going on 14. Hes like a kid in a candy store."}

{"text": "COLOMBIA  About a quarter-million children in Colombia have been displaced by fighting in the past three years of peace negotiations between the government and the countrys leading guerrilla group, the United Nations said in a report released Saturday.Roughly 1,000 Colombian children were used or recruited by nonstate armed combatants during the same period, according to the report by Unicef, the United Nations Childrens Fund.The report also said roughly 200 children were killed or wounded in attacks or from land mines or other explosives in the past three years, and nearly 200 were victims of sexual violence.Unicef released the report as negotiators worked against a March 23 deadline to reach a final agreement to end a half-century of war in Colombia, regarded as the longest active conflict in modern history.More than 220,000 people have been killed in the war, which has pitted government forces against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. Nearly six million people have been displaced.The use of children in armed conflicts is a problem in many areas of the world, but has been especially so in Colombia, where the FARC has been accused of systematically recruiting and training children since its inception in the 1960s.Last month FARC negotiators promised to end the practice as part of a broader effort to reach a peace agreement.The United Nations and international rights groups regard a child as anyone younger than 18.No child in Colombia today knows what it is like to live in a country at peace, Roberto De Bernardi, Unicefs representative in Colombia, said in the report.Even if a peace agreement is reached, Mr. De Bernardi said, he feared that children would still face risks from all kinds of violations including recruitment, land mines and sexual exploitation."}
{"text": "How much do you love me? Do you love me as much as I love you? Are you happy that you love me? How happy?Children, testing their parents, arent the only ones who ask these childish questions; grown-ups do it ad nauseam, and never get satisfactory answers. Though our calculated use of emoji these days would seem to indicate otherwise, it remains an exasperating and thrilling fact of life that emotions cannot be quantified, particularly love.The irreducibility of love is the subject of The Effect, Lucy Prebbles very clever  and ultimately more than clever  play, which opened on Sunday night at the Barrow Street Theater, artfully directed by David Cromer. Ms. Prebble, the British author of Enron, has come up with an ingenious variation on one of the more common romantic formulas in fiction: Put two attractive people in an unfamiliar hothouse environment, and see what blooms.Usually such a premise involves an exotic vacation, a sleep-away camp or perhaps enforced confinement due to war, natural disaster or zombie apocalypse. In The Effect, boy (name of Tristan Frey, played by Carter Hudson) meets girl (Connie Hall, portrayed by Susannah Flood) at a medical research center in which they are guinea pigs in a four-week pharmaceutical trial for a new antidepressant.So when love strikes Connie and Tristan, as it inevitably does, they have to wonder if this is indeed, to borrow from Tom Stoppard, the real thing. After all, the physiological effects of this still-unnamed drug, which kicks up the dopamine levels in the brain, would seem to replicate what we usually identify as the symptoms of love, the kind itemized in Rodgers and Hart ballads: giddiness, loss of appetite, enhanced perception, increased pulse, etc.When one of them asks the other if you really love me, the question is even trickier and more weighted than usual. Especially since its entirely possible that only one of them is on the drug, while the other has been given a placebo. In the meantime, Dr. Lorna James (Kati Brazda), who is overseeing the experiment, finds herself pondering the same ambiguities with Dr. Toby Sealey (Steve Key), her mentor and  it turns out  her former lover.In the decades since Prozac has emerged as a common conversational reference point, a favorite parlor game has been to imagine how antidepressants might have changed the course of cultural history. You know how it works: If mood elevators had been available to Dostoyevsky, would he have written The Brothers Karamazov? Might Ingmar Bergman have made only comedies? Would the Beach Boys have stayed together?You might well worry that The Effect is going to be a more earnest variation on such playful speculation. (I didnt, but then, I took Prozac before the show. Just kidding.) Ms. Prebbles Enron, an account of the fall of that Texas energy company (seen briefly on Broadway in 2010), was an economics pageant that imploded under a surfeit of ardent exposition and flashy gimmickry.The Effect shares the principal virtue of Enron, in that it makes complicated and arcane material utterly accessible. (Ms. Prebble would probably be a splendid schoolteacher.) And both works chronicle the casualties of putting abstract theory into human practice.But The Effect, staged in 2012 at the National Theater in London and the winner of the Critics Circle Award for best new play there, benefits from its smaller scale and more intimate depiction of its characters. This dramas God-playing psychiatrists may have medical technology on their sides to examine their patients inner workings. But we the audience have Ms. Flood and Mr. Hudson, who so transparently embody their characters joy, pain and doubts about the legitimacy of their emotions. Mr. Cromer, one of the most empathic directors working (Our Town, Tribes), has steered these young performers into nakedly passionate portrayals.And in exciting theater, feeling always trumps science. The conflict between these two elements  as well as the muddy area in which they overlap  is precisely mapped in the structure and design of The Effect. Marsha Ginsbergs set provides a context of clinical blankness just waiting to be scrawled upon. (The sullying is evoked not only by the performances but also by Tyler Micoleaus lighting and Maya Ciarrocchis video projections.)Within such regimentation, annotated by the projection of supertitles noting the increasing drug dosages being administered, human idiosyncrasy consistently asserts itself from the beginning. Watch how differently Tristan and Connie respond to their screening interviews with Dr. James, to having blood taken from their arms and even to swallowing their daily medicine.As flirtation segues into erotic compulsion, Connie and Tristans encounters become the stuff of much worry and speculation for Dr. James, who turns out to have her own issues with mood-altering drugs, which she discusses at length with Dr. Sealey. Ms. Brazda and Mr. Frey offer intelligent, credible performances.Yet its hard to avoid the sense that their encounters exist to expand and echo the plays central themes. Even when theyre baring their souls, these doctors seem principally to serve the pedagogical purposes of the script. And its a relief when the focus shifts back to the more demonstrative Tristan and Connie.The scene between them that ends the first act is a knockout, a ravishment of the senses that makes motivation moot. As staged, this depiction of love in a hospital bed takes its participants to a place where being out of control feels like the ultimate control.Is it dopamine, real or artificial, that rules Tristan and Connie here? Are they just biological machines, whether artificially programmed or not?Before you try to answer these questions, wait for another scene involving a hospital bed, the one that comes near the plays conclusion. Ms. Prebble is far too smart to find a firm resolution for the debate at the center of The Effect. But in the end, she leaves room for what might be called a very loving uncertainty."}
{"text": "Gwen Deelys story is an example of how not to deal with a health crisis when traveling abroad. She realizes shes lucky to be alive.Ms. Deely, a 66-year-old living in Manhattan, was on an overnight flight from New York to Venice in October when she developed what she thought was food poisoning, perhaps from the tuna sandwich she had eaten at home that day. She weathered the night armed with more than a dozen airsickness bags and figured it would pass.But it didnt, and she spent the entire week in Venice in bed staring at the ceiling in the Airbnb apartment she and her partner had rented. She attributed her low-grade fever and chills to the flu shot she had received just before the trip.I would have had to take a boat to get to a doctor, and I couldnt even stand up, she said. Her decision not to go to a hospital that was a water taxi ride away was reinforced by a reluctance to seek medical help where she didnt speak the language. Had I been in a hotel, I would have asked to see a doctor who spoke English, she said.Ms. Deely somehow managed to fly home as scheduled, trying not to act sick on the plane, and went from the airport to the emergency room, where blood tests and a CT scan revealed a ruptured appendix.Riddled with infection, she spent five days in a hospital on intravenous antibiotics, followed by months of antibiotic treatment and abdominal drainage at home. Finally, in mid-February, she was healthy enough for her ailing appendix to be removed with laparoscopic surgery, involving several tiny incisions in the abdomen.A ruptured appendix is a life-threatening condition. Blindsided by atypical flulike symptoms rather than the stabbing abdominal pain one usually associates with a ruptured appendix, Ms. Deely failed to realize how close she came to dying. She now knows better than to try to tough it out when unexplained, debilitating symptoms occur.Appendicitis, after all, is very treatable, and surgery is no longer the only option. Patients are now increasingly being offered a trial of antibiotics instead of being rushed into surgery to remove an inflamed appendix (the suffix -itis in appendicitis means inflamed). Without treatment, an inflamed appendix can rupture in two to three days after symptoms develop and can spill dangerous microorganisms throughout the abdomen. Thus, it is important to see a doctor as soon as possible.Symptoms of appendicitis vary, and fewer than half of patients have them all. They often start with abdominal bloating and pain around the navel, which then moves to the lower right side of the abdomen and becomes sharp and continuous. The abdomen is likely to be tender to the touch, and a cough, sneeze, sudden movement or deep breath can intensify the pain. Mild fever, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea or constipation may occur.Such symptoms are a clear warning that requires prompt medical attention. However, a third to a half of people with appendicitis do not have these typical symptoms, making cases like Ms. Deelys especially challenging.The appendix is a finger-shaped pouch attached to the large intestine (colon), usually on the lower right side of the abdomen. Long considered a vestigial organ with no known function, many people, young and old, have theirs removed in the course of another operation.However, there are now indications that the appendix serves as a repository of healthy bacteria that can replenish the gut after an extreme attack of diarrhea. People who have had appendectomies, for example, are more likely to experience recurrent infections with the bacterium Clostridium difficile, a debilitating intestinal infection that causes severe, difficult-to-treat diarrhea.Appendicitis occurs most often in children and young adults, and more often in men than women, but the risk of rupture is highest in older adults. The estimated lifetime chance of developing appendicitis ranges from 7 percent to 14 percent.Acute appendicitis is the nations most common surgical emergency. It is most often performed laparoscopically, which is associated with faster recovery, less pain and lower risk of infection than an open operation. Some 300,000 people in the United States undergo an appendectomy each year, but sometimes, the appendix turns out not to have been inflamed, meaning the operation was not necessary.The results of several recent studies suggest that patients with uncomplicated appendicitis should not be rushed into surgery and instead should be offered the option of a trial of antibiotics.In a controlled study among 540 adult patients, 72.7 percent of 257 patients randomly assigned to take antibiotics in lieu of an operation did not require subsequent surgery a year later, and those who did need surgery had no bad effects from the delay.In another nonrandomized study of 3,236 patients who were not operated on initially, the nonsurgical treatment failed to cure the appendicitis in 5.9 percent of cases, and the inflammation recurred in 4.4 percent.Some patients may choose an operation so they wont have to worry about developing another attack of appendicitis, but if they arent told they have a choice, they can hardly make one.Writing in JAMA last month, Dr. Dana A. Telem, a surgeon at Stony Brook University Medical Center, noted that the notion of nonoperative treatment of appendicitis has not been well-received by the majority of the surgical community. This is hardly surprising, because doctors, like many of us, are creatures of habit, and surgeons who dont operate miss out on a hefty fee.But Dr. Telem pointed out that under the Affordable Care Act, it may soon become necessary for physicians to inform patients of nonsurgical options, which may include watch and wait, as some cases of appendicitis disappear without any treatment, and there may be nothing wrong with the appendix in others.Surgeons would be well served to take a leadership role in proactively developing decision aids to inform patients about the benefits and risks for both nonoperative antibiotic treatment and surgical treatment of appendicitis, Dr. Telem said. She added, however, that the information should include the fact that data on the long-term outcome of nonsurgical treatment is currently lacking.Also lacking is a large controlled trial in which patients with uncomplicated appendicitis are randomly assigned to antibiotic or surgical treatment and followed for perhaps five or more years. Such a study could define exactly which patients do best with nonoperative therapy and which require immediate surgery.Related:For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}
{"text": "Tens of thousands of miners were on strike and coal prices were skyrocketing in October 1902. Afraid of unrest, President Theodore Roosevelt sought the help of John Pierpont Morgan.The powerful banker, who held great sway over the coal industry, brokered a deal with the miners that ended the strike.My dear sir, the president wrote to Mr. Morgan. Let me thank you for the service you have rendered the whole people.Americas coal industry is now facing another dark hour, but this time there are few financiers willing to save it.Mr. Morgans bank, now JPMorgan Chase, announced two weeks ago that it would no longer finance new coal-fired power plants in the United States or other wealthy nations. The retreat follows similar announcements by Bank of America, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley that they are, in one way or another, backing away from coal.While coal has been declining over the last several years, Wall Streets broad retreat is an ominous sign for the industry.There are always going to be periods of boom and bust, said Chiza Vitta, a metals and mining analyst with the credit rating firm Standard & Poors. But what is happening in coal is a downward shift that is permanent.On Wednesday the worlds largest private-sector coal company, Peabody Energy, said that it might have to file for bankruptcy protection, following a path already taken by three of the nations other large coal companies.Peabody has been trying to sell three of its mines in Colorado and New Mexico to raise cash. But the sale to Bowie Resource Partners appears to have stalled amid the difficult financing environment. Bowie did not comment. A Peabody spokesman said the company stands ready to complete the sale of assets to Bowie.Coal, like railroads, steel and other engines of the nations industrial expansion in the 19th and early 20th centuries, helped drive Wall Streets profits for generations. More than a century later, the coal industry is in a free fall and the banks are pulling away.Given the state of the coal industry today, I think Mr. Morgan himself might make the same decision, said Jean Strouse, a biographer of the banker.Some banks say they are trying to do their part to curtail climate change by moving away from coal projects and financing ventures that produce less carbon. But bankers also say there is a more basic reason for the shift: Lending to coal companies is too risky and could ultimately prove unprofitable.Coal companies are being squeezed by competition from less expensive energy sources like natural gas and by stiffer regulations  pressures that show no signs of letting up.As a result, even the most secure loans  like those made to companies emerging from bankruptcy, known as debtor-in-possession loans  are increasingly off limits for many banks, according to bankers and industry lawyers.And it is not just big banks. Even many more daring investors like hedge funds and private equity firms, which are usually eager to pounce on industries in distress, are shying away from coal because of deep uncertainty about its future.It is a starkly different scene in the oil industry, where investors are raising hundreds of millions of dollars to snap up the debt and equity of troubled companies that are struggling with an oversupply of oil. Despite the immediate stress, many investors expect the oil glut will burn off by next year and prices will rebound.But in the coal country of Appalachia, it is unclear whether many unprofitable mines can ever make money again.There is certainly no $40 billion titan looking to make a big play in coal right now, said Marshall Huebner, co-leader of the insolvency and restructuring practice at Davis Polk & Wardwell who has represented several coal companies in recent bankruptcies.Despite the challenges, the coal industry still powers roughly a third of the nations electricity. Industry officials say the business will eventually bounce back, once supplies burn off and demand for coal rebounds in places like China.Coal is part of our future, and I think the banks are taking a shortsighted view, said Mike Duncan, president of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, an industry group. They are ignoring a huge market and buying into rhetoric that just doesnt work.Environmental groups, meanwhile, are hoping the banks reluctance will hasten the collapse of coal. Groups like the Rainforest Action Network have been pressuring banks for months to reduce coal lending.With much of the world committed to stabilizing the climate, we need the banks to follow quickly with measures to end coal financing altogether, said Ben Collins, a senior campaigner at Rainforest Action Network.But the banks retreat could inflict collateral damage on an industry that employs tens of thousands of workers and needs financing not only to keep operating, but also to clean up coal mines after they close. If coal companies are unable to pay for the mine reclamation, taxpayers could be on the hook for the cleanup costs.As big American lenders pull back, a few foreign banks, like Deutsche Bank, have been willing to step in, industry officials say.In its latest annual corporate responsibility report, Deutsche Bank said it was phasing out financing for projects that employ so-called mountaintop removal mining, which environmentalists say is particularly harmful. But the banks policy statement did not commit to the type of broad reduction in coal exposure that many American lenders have made in recent months.In a statement, a bank spokeswoman said that Deutsche Bank is one of the most prominent banks when it comes to clean energy financing. She added that the bank has very strict guidelines governing any financing decisions. We conduct a thorough and detailed analysis on a case-by-case approach, drawing on a deep understanding of wider socioeconomic and environmental trends.Even most American banks are not cutting off funding to the industry overnight, saying that for the moment coal remains a major source of energy, particularly outside the United States.JPMorgan, for instance, is halting financing of new coal-fired plants in wealthy nations like the United States, but will continue to lend to such plants in the developing world, where in some places the coal market is still thriving. To receive financing, however, these plants need to use certain environmentally sound technologies, according the banks new policy.Changes to the coal lending policy at Bank of America have created tension between senior leadership and rank-and-file bankers.Senior leaders wanted the banks energy lending strategy to reflect a transition from a high-carbon to a low-carbon economy, said James Mahoney, who oversees public policy issues at the bank and worked on the new coal policy. It is part of Bank of Americas current effort at responsible growth  which entails not taking undue risks like lending to a troubled industry, Mr. Mahoney said.But the shift has been uncomfortable for some of the bankers serving the coal industry.It put them in a difficult position to say to the companies they have worked with for years, We are pulling back, Mr. Mahoney said. It runs counter to everything we do as a client-focused company.Speaking at an environmental conference at the United Nations in January, Bank of Americas chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, acknowledged the internal tensions around coal but said that the bank was trying to pull back gradually from the sector.When you have real clients involved, these decisions get difficult, Mr. Moynihan said. But I think the view of the people working on it is: We have to help people make the transition.That transition seemed to accelerate last week with the warning from Peabody that it would miss $71 million in interest payments.One of Peabodys best hopes for avoiding bankruptcy, analysts said, was the potential sale of three mines to Bowie Natural Resources.Bowie is a rare breed of coal company. It has been expanding its operations, focusing largely on Utah, a state that still relies primarily on coal to generate electricity. Still, Bowie in recent weeks has apparently had trouble raising the full $650 million in debt to acquire the mines.In many debt deals, banks would cover the shortfall. But Deutsche Bank and Citigroup agreed only to make their best effort to raise the debt for Bowie. The banks did not commit any of their own money, as a traditional underwriter might do.Those best efforts might not be enough."}
{"text": "USUALLY when companies come out with a new and improved formula, they want the public to know. But when the item in question is an iconic food product, the calculus gets tougher. Every marketer remembers with a shudder the cautionary tale of New Coke.So when Kraft Heinz reached inside the blue box to tweak the recipe for its macaroni and cheese, it chose to whisper rather than shout the results.A new formula that removed artificial preservatives and swapped out artificial dyes for a combination of paprika, annatto and turmeric had been under development for three years, and last April Kraft announced that it planned to make the switch. But when the reformulated version hit shelves in December, only customers paying careful attention to the ingredients listed on the side of the box would have known. Even the orangeish color of the mac and cheese remained the same.Weve sold well over 50 million boxes with essentially no one noticing, said Greg Guidotti, vice president for meal solutions at Kraft Heinz.This was absolutely brilliant of them to change it and not say anything, said Lynn Dornblaser, director of innovation and insight at the market research firm Mintel.Now Kraft is getting a little more vocal.A new ad campaign plays up the element of surprise involved with the companys new mac and cheese formula, with 15- and 30-second broadcast and online video spots featuring the former late-night television host Craig Kilborn and the tag line, Its changed. But it hasnt.Kraft was concerned that people would perceive a change in flavor that wasnt really there if it made too big a deal about the different formula as soon as it started using it. In fact, when the company made the announcement last spring that it would be tweaking the ingredients, Mr. Guidotti said, people began posting on social media their concerns that the mac and cheese would taste different.We knew we wanted to address that tension, he said.Some on social media even said, shortly after the April announcement, that they thought the mac and cheese tasted different when, in reality, they were still eating the previous version. This is a psychological quirk, well known to food manufacturers, that can stymie well-meaning attempts to make processed foods healthier.Anytime theres a suggestion of what something should taste like, some aspect of taste, when we try that food, were looking for it, said David Just, a professor of behavioral economics at Cornell University who is affiliated with the Cornell Food and Brand Lab. Whenever you have labels like healthier or reformulated, people are looking for the absence of a taste they really like.Ms. Dornblaser added, Normally, consumers are going to expect when theres going to be a reformulation of whatever kind, theyre going to expect it to taste different and to look different.Overcoming such a hard-wired preconception required stealth.Our first advice to them was not to tell anyone about it, which is unusual for an ad agency, said Adam Chasnow, vice president and executive creative director for Crispin Porter & Bogusky, Krafts partner in developing the campaign. Were going to focus on the fact that things are still the same.In addition to the commercials with Mr. Kilborn, the campaign includes a two-and-a-half-minute online video that takes a more serious, documentary-style look at the change; digital display ads; and promotions through Pandora online radio, Snapchat and ESPNs SportsCenter. Print ads in 20 magazines, including Southern Living, US Weekly and Essence, cheekily tell readers things like, Wed invite you to try it, but you already have.Kraft is also encouraging fans to post on social media with the hashtag #didntnotice by offering giveaways, including a pillow shaped like Krafts curved macaroni noodle.Mr. Guidotti said that since the company revealed that it had been using the new formula for some time, customer feedback has been generally positive, although there was a spate of posts from customers claiming that they actually had noticed the change. When you say something, people will say, Oh yeah, I knew that,  he said. Theres psychology involved in there as well.Before the campaign began, Kraft and Crispin Porter & Bogusky worried that a sharp-eyed fan or a food blogger would notice the changes to the ingredients list and act as a spoiler.We were always concerned, Mr. Guidotti said. Should consumers find out sooner, we had contingencies. We had a lot of different ways of launching our advertising sooner, launching our social sooner, having more specific responses.None of that proved to be necessary, not that Mr. Guidotti or his team are complaining.I think we probably did five times as much work, but it was all worth it, he said."}
{"text": "Vivien Foldes says she does not regret having her breasts removed five years ago after she was found to have an early-stage cancer.But there are things Ms. Foldes, a 58-year-old accountant from Woodmere, N.Y., wishes she had known when she chose a double mastectomy, like the fact that the process of reconstruction would drag on for five months and leave her forever unable to sleep on her stomach. Or that it would leave her with no sensation from the front all the way to the back in the entire bra area, she said. Nothing. Zero. Zip.Ms. Foldes says there are days that she asks herself, Should I have done it? But, she said, her mother had two types of cancer, and she wanted to be proactive: I didnt want to be waiting for the other shoe to drop.Ms. Foldes is one of a growing number of women opting to have both breasts removed after a diagnosis of breast cancer, even though doctors say the operation does not improve the chances of survival. Now a new study, based on surveys of thousands of women, suggests women who have double mastectomies also do not benefit from a big improvement in quality of life, either. The study was published online in the Journal of Clinical Oncology earlier this monthQuite a few studies have shown that in patients who dont have a genetic mutation that increases breast cancer risk, the benefit from removing the healthy breast  purely from a cancer perspective  is zero to tiny at best, said Dr. E. Shelley Hwang, the chief of breast surgery at Duke Cancer Institute, who led the study.What she wanted to find out was, If it doesnt extend longevity, does it at least improve their quality of life?Dr. Hwang concluded that the benefits were marginal. I dont want to sound terribly negative; some women had very good results and are happy they made the decision, she said. But, she added, Youre not better off, youre not happier, you dont feel better about yourself sexually by having the healthy breast removed.The number of women opting to remove the cancerous breast and the healthy breast  a procedure known as contralateral prophylactic mastectomy or C.P.M.  has surged in recent years. In 2011, about 11 percent of women who were having a mastectomy for cancer chose C.P.M., compared with less than 2 percent in 1998.Many breast cancer doctors are concerned by the trend, which they expect to increase. Women with early-stage breast cancer have the same odds of survival whether they have a lumpectomy or a mastectomy, and research suggests the risk of a cancer in the contralateral breast is low. But patients say they want to eliminate even the most negligible risk of a recurrence or cancer in their healthy breast.Nine times out of 10, the women are the ones who decide, Dr. Hwang said. They have cancer, they never want to deal with it again, they just want both breasts off, and they cant rest until the other breast is done.But Dr. Hwang says she has seen the downside of double mastectomies. Surgical complications can occur during reconstruction, which is often a protracted process, and many women have unrealistic expectations about what the new breasts will look and feel like after reconstruction.Surgery usually leaves the patient with no sensation in the breast area, and the extensive operations can also result in chronic pain.One patient said she couldnt feel hugs anymore when she snuggled up to her kids, Dr. Hwang said. That really affected me.Many women are influenced by family history. Valerie Garguilo, 54, of Bellport, N.Y., watched her sister die in 2008 after a seven-year bout with breast cancer that was treated with a lumpectomy followed by two recurrences and two more lumpectomies, and then metastasis to her bones and brain. When Ms. Garguilo was found to have a stage-zero cancer herself four years ago, she opted for a double mastectomy, even though she tested negative for harmful genetic mutations.I wanted to do whatever I could to cut my chances of a recurrence; I wasnt going to keep going in for lumpectomies, she said.Some women say they do not believe studies that report no difference in survival rates. I feel like a lumpectomy cant possibly get everything out, said Maria Sawicki, 67, of Massapequa, N.Y., who needed a mastectomy on her affected breast but removed her other breast as well. The littlest thing can be missed.For the study, 3,977 volunteers who had had mastectomies  including 1,598 who had had both breasts removed  completed an extensive survey, called BREAST-Q. The survey measured physical well-being, which asks about neck, arm and upper back pain, mobility and the ability to lift the arms; psychosocial well-being, which focuses on body image and confidence in social settings; sexual well-being, including sexual confidence and feelings of attractiveness and comfort level during sex; and breast satisfaction. The last question asks whether bras and clothes fit well, whether the breasts are symmetrical and whether one is comfortable with ones appearance, clothed and unclothed.After adjusting for differences between the groups, the researchers found that women who had had double mastectomies had slightly higher scores on psychosocial well-being and breast satisfaction  the differences were only about a point higher on a scale of 100. But scores on the other domains of physical and sexual well-being did not differ from those of women who did not have double mastectomies.The most important factor in a womans overall well-being, the new study found, was whether she had had reconstructive surgery. Most women who had had such surgery reported substantially higher quality of life scores, whether they had single or double mastectomies.Thats a much more powerful intervention to improve quality of life than a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy, Dr. Hwang said.For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON  Donald J. Trumps transformation from reality TV star to presidential candidate threatening to tear apart the Republican Party is eliciting a mixture of disbelief, outrage and laughter among Democrats, and none more so than President Obama.Mr. Trump has long been a punch line for Mr. Obama  the president skewered him in humorous speeches at three White House Correspondents Association dinners. But in recent months, Mr. Obama has made so many direct or indirect references to Mr. Trump that the real estate tycoon has become something of a stump-speech standard for the president. And instead of simply being a source of mirth, Mr. Trump has become Mr. Obamas favored symbol for the countrys growing political dysfunction.On Tuesday, Mr. Obama used the annual Friends of Ireland luncheon with lawmakers on Capitol Hill to launch his latest attack on Mr. Trump, although this time not by name. We have heard vulgar and divisive rhetoric aimed at women and minorities  at Americans who dont look like us, or pray like us, or vote like we do, Mr. Obama said. A few days earlier at a fund-raiser in Austin, Tex., Mr. Obama was even more pointed. Weve got a debate inside the other party that is fantasy and schoolyard taunts and selling stuff like its the Home Shopping Network, he said. He then went after Republican leaders like Mitt Romney who have in recent weeks expressed shock and outrage at Mr. Trumps language.How can you be shocked? Mr. Obama asked of Mr. Romney, the former presidential candidate who accepted Mr. Trumps endorsement in 2012. This is the guy, remember, who was sure that I was born in Kenya. Who just wouldnt let it go.Aides recall the obviously false birther allegations stirred by Mr. Trump as an almost out-of-body experience. Standing at the podium in the briefing room with the White House counsel to release the presidents birth certificate was probably the most surreal moment I had in the White House, Dan Pfeiffer, a former senior adviser to Mr. Obama, wrote in an email.Indeed, the day in April 2011 that Mr. Obama walked into the White House briefing room to directly address Mr. Trumps allegations, Mr. Trump flew to New Hampshire in his signature plane to test the waters of a presidential run. Days later, Mr. Obama made Mr. Trump the object of a string of humiliating jokes at a White House Correspondents Association dinner, saying that Mr. Obamas release of his birth certificate would allow Mr. Trump to get back to focusing on the issues that matter like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?Mr. Trump soon left the dinner, evidently bruised. It was a moment that White House aides recall with relish.Trump is at his very nature an insecure carnival barker, so the best way to unmask him is to show everyone that its all a circus, Mr. Pfeiffer wrote.In a statement forwarded by his campaign staff on Sunday, Mr. Trump said that if I had run in 2012, Obama would have been a one-term president.Sadly for the United States, and in fact the world, I did not run, Mr. Trump added. According to every online poll, I have won every debate, and I would have done so with Obama, also. Obama would have been so easy for me  in fact, it was widely reported that when I was thinking about running, all he was talking about was Trump.During debates in the 2012 campaign, Mr. Obama again used Mr. Trump to make a point  this time to show how much Mr. Romneys tax plans would favor the wealthy by classifying many as small businesses. And I know Donald Trump doesnt like to think of himself as small anything, Mr. Obama said in what now seems a preview of a far more vulgar discussion about the size of Mr. Trumps hands and appendages in this years debates, but thats how you define small businesses if youre getting business income.After Mr. Trump vowed last fall to deport any Syrian refugee the Obama administration managed to settle in the United States, Mr. Obama lost his sense of humor. Standing beside  President Benigno Aquino III of the Philippines in Manila, he lashed out at politicians using refugees as a political tool, including those who suggest that theyre so tough that just talking to Putin or staring down ISIL, or using some additional rhetoric somehow is going to solve the problems out there.But apparently, theyre scared of widows and orphans coming into the United States of America as part of our tradition of compassion, Mr. Obama continued, and then mentioned complaints by Republican candidates that moderators of CNBCs recent debate were too tough. First, they were worried about the press being too tough on them during debates. Now theyre worried about 3-year-old orphans. That doesnt sound very tough to me.White House aides have little doubt about which man would win an electoral matchup. One thing I have lamented with former colleagues is that the president doesnt get to run against Donald Trump, said Bill Burton, a former spokesman for the Obama campaign.Republican challengers to Mr. Trump have yet to settle on an effective strategy to counter him. Marco Rubio now is widely seen as all but ending his presidential hopes when he began mocking Mr. Trump with crude jokes. And Mr. Trump has managed to shrug off attacks about his shifting positions and questionable business practices. To date, Obama is the only public figure who is able to put Trump in his place without rolling around in the mud with him, Mr. Pfeiffer said.Whether that record continues will soon become clear if Mr. Trump wins the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Obama has vowed to campaign vigorously for the eventual Democratic nominee, whom Mr. Obama has told Democratic donors will soon be Hillary Clinton. But whether his line of attack against Mr. Trump would be outrage, humor or a mixture of both is uncertain.I mean, imagine what Trump would say if he actually had a record like this, Mr. Obama said to laughter at the recent fund-raiser in Austin. Instead of selling steaks. Has anybody tried that wine? How good can that wine be? Im sorry. Where was I?"}
{"text": "Apple is getting ready for a busy week.On Monday, the company is holding an event at its Silicon Valley headquarters to unveil smaller versions of its iPhone and iPad Pro. Then on Tuesday, Apple will face off against the United States government at a hearing in federal court in Riverside, Calif., over whether it must help law enforcement break into an iPhone used by a gunman in last years San Bernardino, Calif., terrorist attack.The iPhone case has proved to be particularly divisive. According to a New York Times/CBS News poll, 50 percent of respondents said Apple should accede to the government and help unlock the iPhone, while 45 percent were opposed. Overall, peoples attitudes toward surveillance appear to have softened, with a quarter saying the federal government infringes too much on privacy, down from nearly half in a similar poll two years ago.Katie Benner, who is covering Apples legal entanglements from San Francisco, and Matt Apuzzo, who covers national security from Washington, recently debated the iPhone case and what to expect from Tuesdays hearing:Katie Benner Hi, Matt. What do you make of how dramatic this fight has gotten? Over the last month, each round of court filings has gotten a little testier.Matt Apuzzo A lot of its been theater, but  and here I go getting all rah-rah  it isnt necessarily a bad thing that people are being asked to think in a really big way about law and policy. I cant think of a case in which a novel legal argument has captured the attention of so many people. Everyone has a phone. Everyone gets this debate.Katie Agreed. So give us the governments strongest arguments.Matt Lets start with the weakest arguments  its more fun that way.The government began by saying this case was just about opening this one iPhone. That is by far the weakest argument. Even the government has now walked away from that one. Everyone realizes this is a precedent-setting case.On the strong argument side, the Justice Department has been unfairly mocked by some about the fact that its relying on a law from the 1700s  the All Writs Act  to justify opening this phone.The fact that the law is two centuries old just tells you that its a core tenet of our judicial system. I think the Department of Justice has stronger footing with this than people give it credit for. The All Writs Act says that government lawyers can say, Judge, you have the authority to enforce your own orders. Thats not a controversial argument, on the face of it.Katie, what are Apples arguments?Katie Im going to answer in broad strokes because Apples arguments are complicated.Essentially, Apples main argument is that the All Writs Act, which is used when there is a gap in the law, doesnt permit the court to force Apple to write new code for the government. The company bolsters its position by arguing that the governments request doesnt even fall into a gap in existing law. Apple says that a law called the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which broadly says when and how companies must help the government with electronic surveillance, addresses the D.O.J.s request in this case. Congress has thought about adding tech companies like Apple to Calea but decided against doing so.Apple argues that Congresss declining to amending that law is the same thing as saying that tech companies are exempt from the existing rule. So the All Writs Act is moot here, Apple contends.Apple also makes constitutional arguments, including one that addresses the First Amendment. The company says that code is a form of free speech and that compelling people to write it  in this case to help unlock an iPhone  is infringing on their constitutional rights.One analogy, perhaps, would be the government telling journalists to help an investigation by writing an article that includes specific elements and then publishing it on the front page. I cant imagine a lot of journalists who would want to do that.Matt Well, judges try to avoid ruling on constitutional questions. My money is on the likelihood that this case will come down to the judges reading of the All Writs Act. There, the government argument is based on cases that long predate any of the mobile technology we have now. To make its case, the government is arguing that something like rewriting a mobile operating system today is essentially the same as leasing old-fashioned telephone wires in the 1970s.The bigger issue here is this: Has all this modern technology made existing law obsolete? Im not sure I buy your First Amendment comparison between writing code and writing a newspaper article only because there really is not a predigital analogy that works here.Katie Yes! None of the laws we have now anticipated a world in which communications could be global and completely encrypted. We need new laws, and Congress may be pressured to deliver some.Matt Im not holding my breath that we get legislation out of Congress in the midst of an election cycle, with the parties so divided that they cant consider a Supreme Court justice. Whatever we get will be imperfect, which isnt a terrible thing. Political compromise is part of the process.Katie Matt, youre such a believer in our imperfect democracy. Im singing the national anthem in my mind.Matt Just hum it. We get it.But seriously, one thing I do hear from those in federal law enforcement a lot is that they would be fine with losing the authority to search and wiretap devices like the iPhone  but only if the American people change their expectations of law enforcement.If privacy overrides security here, a lot of agents will say fine. Just dont expect them to prevent every attack and solve every crime. And honestly, as a country, weve made that decision on guns. We accept a certain amount of gun crime and resist infringement on the Second Amendment.Let me ask you this. Do you think for Apple, the stakes really are as high as it says? We have reported that the company is already at work on a software update that would make it impossible for the government to break into a locked iPhone, even with the methods it is asking Apple about now in this case. And Apple can drag this case out for a year. The courts would not be able to keep up with the innovation.Katie But this is the government asking Apple to find a way to go back and weaken something  iPhone security  that it has already created.If the government gets that, it could order Apple to roll back or find ways to break into any future innovation. The government might later be able to say, we need you to weaken something else, something different, because you did it before with a different  now obsolete  part of your system.Matt You are headed to the hearing on Tuesday. What scene are you expecting?Katie Protesters are already saying theyll be at the courthouse. Court officials are saying they expect huge lines to get the few available seats. And supporters on all sides will probably show up. So in short: chaos."}

{"text": "New York City Council members are joining a growing national movement to improve access to feminine hygiene products, and on Tuesday will introduce proposals for free tampons and pads in city public school restrooms and homeless shelters, and easier access at correctional facilities.This has been so taboo for so long, that no one even thought about it, said Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras-Copeland, who led local efforts with a pilot project providing free pads and tampons at a high school in Queens that is being expanded to include 25 schools. Its just been something that it has never been O.K. to talk about.In addition, Ms. Ferreras-Copeland, Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez and the Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, all Democrats, will introduce a resolution calling on the State Legislature to stop taxing sanitary products. The state does not tax groceries, prescription drugs or condoms, but it does tax tampons and sanitary pads. This month, the New York State Assembly passed a bill eliminating sales tax on tampons and pads, but the measure has yet to pass the Senate.The proposals by the council members are the latest in a series of efforts around the world that some supporters call menstrual equity  a movement that calls for feminine hygiene products to be treated the same as toilet paper and other necessities that are typically not taxed or are supplied free in public restrooms. Chicago rescinded city taxes on sanitary products this month, California lawmakers are pushing for an end to tampon taxes, and Canada scrapped the taxes last year. Efforts to make sanitary products available free in public facilities are underway in Wisconsin and Ohio.Ms. Ferreras-Copeland said she could foresee making free menstrual products available in the citys public hospitals, parks and recreational centers, and at youth and community programs.A bill requiring the New York City Correction Department to provide all female inmates with pads or tampons immediately upon their request, and at the facilitys expense, is meant to improve the current way of allocating sanitary products, which is done according to an arcane formula that allots 144 pads a week to every 50 inmates, council members said in interviews.That works out to about 12 pads per woman per cycle, which may not be sufficient, the council members said. If a woman needs more than that, she may request them or buy them at her own expense at the commissary. The bill calls for eliminating the formula and providing either pads or tampons as requested.Ms. Ferreras-Copeland called the formula ridiculous, and said that every woman had different needs. You dont ration toilet paper or ask for permission for more toilet paper, she said. You shouldnt have to for these products.The estimated cost to the city was expected to top $5 million a year, most of that for the school system, according to the Councils finance division. According to one estimate by the advocacy organization Free the Tampons, the annual cost of providing tampons and pads at restrooms in schools and businesses will be less than $5 a year per woman or girl.The expanded pilot program Ms. Ferreras-Copeland announced last week to install tampon and pad dispensers in 25 public middle and high schools was estimated to cost $160,000 for a year, including the cost of replenishing the supply of products, according to Ms. Ferreras-Copelands office.Women cannot participate in society without some sort of menstrual product, said Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, a writer and lawyer from Maplewood, N.J., who is a leading advocate for lifting tampon taxes and providing sanitary supplies in public restrooms and schools and coined the term menstrual equity. As a society, we have an interest in ensuring that girls dont fall behind in school and women arent unproductive at their jobs simply because they cant afford these products, she said.This year, Representative Grace Meng, Democrat of Queens, persuaded officials who oversee the Federal Emergency Management Agency to allow its homeless assistance funds to cover feminine hygiene products, after she noticed the grants could not be used to buy sanitary pads even though they cover other basic necessities such as toothpaste and diapers. Sanitary products will be added to the list of allowable purchases beginning in April.Ms. Meng has also introduced legislation that would allow employees to use flexible spending account funds to buy feminine hygiene products. Right now the money can be used to cover certain medical items like prescription eyeglasses and bandages, but not sanitary pads or tampons.For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}
{"text": "When I was a teenager, my friends and I had a blast watching television together  often really bad television  and mocking it ceaselessly. We became the entertainment, not whatever clumsy dialogue or plot twist we derided.Last week, I felt as if I were 16 again as I watched hours of a four-day, nonstop showing of The French Chef, Julia Childs groundbreaking cooking show, with several thousand complete strangers online. It was a surreal experience and, at times, hysterical.The Julia Child marathon took place on Twitch, a service owned by Amazon that has developed a gigantic online audience by letting gamers broadcast themselves playing Counter-Strike, League of Legends and other games over the Internet.While there are plenty of other video streaming sites  notably, the much larger YouTube  a big part of Twitchs magic is how audiences interact with each other and broadcasters in real time through a chat room adjacent to whatever video is streaming.With the Julia Child marathon on Twitch, the peanut gallery was everything. If you want to carefully study Mrs. Childs technique for making roast duck  lorange, there are much better places to find episodes of The French Chef online, including iTunes and YouTube. Nowhere else but Twitch could you see Mrs. Child lionized for her knife skills as though she had disemboweled an enemy in Mortal Kombat.This stage is difficult, but Julia is executing this perfectly, top level player, one Twitch viewer wrote.Part of the charm of watching The French Chef on Twitch was the fish-out-of-water nature of the event. Twitchs audience skews heavily toward men ages 18 to 34. Not only were most Twitch viewers not alive when the show began showing in 1963, but some of their parents were not alive either.It didnt hurt that Mrs. Child had an idiosyncratic television presence that has long made her a source of endearment and parody, most famously by Dan Aykroyd on Saturday Night Live in 1978.This was the second time Twitch has turned to a dead public television icon to branch out from its usual game-heavy content. Last year, it surprised a lot of people  Twitch executives included  when a weeklong stream of more than 400 episodes of The Joy of Painting, featuring the landscape artist Bob Ross, attracted 5.6 million viewers.After The French Chef marathon concluded Saturday evening, Twitch began showing a batch of other cooking programs on a new food channel, including Julia and Jacques  Cooking at Home featuring Mrs. Child and the chef Jacques Ppin, and A Taste of History with the chef Walter Staib.The Twitch chat rooms around The French Chef and Joy of Painting events were a thicket of gamer in-jokes, jargon and emojis (theyre called emotes on Twitch). The community generates memes  popular online jokes and catchphrases  at a head-spinning pace, a lot of it indecipherable to people who arent fluent in the native tongue of Twitch and game culture.At first, I felt as if I was Neo in The Matrix, watching incomprehensible lines of code cascading down the screen in front of me. I caught on with some Googling and consulting with insiders at Twitch. A lot of the chat was sophomoric, some of it was offensive, but enough was so funny and well-timed that I kept coming back for more.In one early episode, Mrs. Child used a wooden mallet to whack a carving knife through the spine of a roasted chicken. It was an amusingly violent scene, one that the Twitch chat room ran with, turning her into a Hannibal Lecter with an apron.HAMMER TIME ... SAVAGE ... THE HORROR ... THE BUTCHERER, the messages flew by.The chat room roared with Mrs. Childs copious use of butter and different forms of alcohol in her recipes. Whenever she dumped salt onto a dish, a flood of salt can emojis followed.When Mrs. Child employed some deft knife work, the Twitch chat room filled with the letters VAC. I later learned that the expression stands for Valve Anti-Cheat, software that detects whether players are cheating in games made by the publisher Valve, such as Counter-Strike. The suggestion seemed to be that Mrs. Child's kitchen skills were so expert as to be suspicious.Conversely, whenever Mrs. Child dropped a bit of food or made another mistake, which she did often, the Twitch chatters pecked out Ruined  a meme that became a favorite during the Bob Ross marathon when the painter seemed to make a clumsy brush stroke. Roux-end was another variation during the Mrs. Child event.Ultimately, Mrs. Child did not attract as many viewers as Mr. Ross did on Twitch. At the peak, about 8,000 viewers were watching her at the same time, compared with about 183,000 for Mr. Ross, according to Twitch.Whenever I checked, the size of her audience was sufficient to place her in the top 25 broadcasters on Twitch at those moments. About 1 million viewers total tuned into the show at some point during the marathon  not bad for a television show that started more than half a century ago.In this case, Mrs. Childs show was the appetizer. The Twitch community was the main course."}
{"text": "In recent months, there has been a sharp drop in Chinas foreign reserves, with lots of families and companies sending dollars overseas as the government cracks down on corruption and the economy weakens. Those fears have not let up, though this month the Chinese central bank did report an abrupt, puzzling slowdown in the outflows in February.What is known is that people seek a safe haven for their money in uncertain times, and that usually means the United States. This is especially true now that the United States has higher interest rates than other developed economies.As money rushes in, regulators should be thinking about the lessons of the 2008 financial crisis. In such times, lenders tend to lower their standards and make questionable loans. In 2015, loans held by American banks expanded at the fastest pace since 2007, driven mainly by commercial-property loans and also by car loans, credit cards and residential mortgages. The surge far outpaced growth in the overall economy last year, a sign that too much money may be chasing too few good opportunities and that lenders may be compromising standards.Another lesson was that banks, hedge funds and other financial firms are often linked through speculative bets they place on financial developments. Currently, some American hedge funds are making large bets on a devaluation of Chinas currency in the next 12 to 18 months. Regulators should be anticipating how this could reverberate through the financial system.Regulators do know more now about the vulnerabilities in the financial system, thanks in part to the increasing rigor of bank stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010. Even in areas where regulations under Dodd-Frank have been delayed and watered down, like rules to limit banks involvement with hedge funds, regulatory pressure and market forces have led banks to curtail some of the riskiest activities.But the system is still too opaque, and resistance to regulation remains fierce. Mutual funds, for instance, are opposing a rule that would require them to hold more reserves as a buffer against large and sudden redemptions.The lessons of the last financial crisis are clear. Less clear is whether regulators have the tools and the willingness to apply what they have learned to new circumstances and new threats."}

{"text": "POCATELLO, Idaho   When the Rev. Jim Jones, pastor of the Blazing Grace Church here, approached the lectern at City Hall, he was holding a copy of the Quran.The Islamic text commanded followers to embrace intolerance, hate and violence, he told the zoning panel, explaining why he felt uncomfortable with the plan of Middle Eastern students at Idaho State University to build a mosque within walking distance of campus.I get very fearful because I live close to this place, Mr. Jones told the panel, which was considering a rezoning request.The mosque was approved. But the remarks by Mr. Jones and other opponents at the February 2014 hearing were signs of the fissures developing in this railroad town as Idaho State became increasingly dependent on Saudi and Kuwaiti students to replace income lost from steep declines in local enrollment and state funding.The potential payoff of having these students was big  $20,000 per student in annual out-of-state tuition, nearly three times what state residents pay. As the number of Middle Eastern students grew to nearly 1,200, almost 10 percent of the schools enrollment, that meant an estimated $40 million for the local economy every year.But Idaho State had not bargained for the cultural clash in this isolated community. Even if they were just normal, rowdy college kids, the behavior of the mostly male students stood out in this conservative, predominantly Mormon city. Free from the strict cultural mores of their home countries, some students have faced charges like drunken driving and stalking.At the same time, professors said students, many of them unfamiliar with English, were ill-prepared and frequently resorted to cheating.Students have taken umbrage to the accusations, and have recounted episodes of discrimination on campus and in town. Now some students are leaving.For Idaho State, it is a moment of truth, with a loss of more than $2 million a year in tuition alone from 100 students who left last summer. More declines are expected.Were preparing for the worst, said Scott Scholes, the associate vice president for enrollment management.As colleges across the country, including prestigious universities like the University of California, Berkeley, second-tier state universities and little-known private institutions, look to make up for budget cuts and declining enrollment by accepting more foreign students, the situation at Idaho State is a cautionary tale, an example of the complexities of integrating foreign students into a campus and a community.By some estimates, the one million international students in the United States generate a $30.5 billion boost to the economy. The largest group comes from China, but Saudi Arabia, the fourth-largest country of origin, supplies more than 70,000 students to schools like Arizona State, Western Kentucky, Cleveland State and Southern Illinois.Some of these institutions are particularly concerned about the impact of a recent announcement by the King Abdullah Scholarship Program, which supports most of the students from Saudi Arabia. The program is facing deep funding cuts, according to Moodys Investors Service, which said the scholarships would be limited to the top 100 American schools, an Academic Ranking of World Universities list that does not include Idaho State.The Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission to the United States, which administers the scholarship program, did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. Scholes said new limits established by the Saudi and Kuwaiti governments might mean that no Middle Eastern freshmen will be arriving at Idaho State for the next academic year, cutting enrollment by more than 250, on top of the 100 Saudi students who have already departed.Explaining another reason for the declining enrollment, Daniel Hummel, a political-science professor who is also secretary of the new mosque, said, Some of the students are dissatisfied, and theyre leaving.Although this virtually all-Christian city does not appear to be a natural fit for Muslims  the courthouse lawn features a monument chiseled with the Ten Commandments  everything seemed fine when the first 17 Saudi students arrived in 2006, mostly in the engineering school. Over time, the students began sending word back home about Pocatellos attributes, particularly the low cost of living, said Nezar Alnejidi, a marketing major and student leader. On a monthly stipend of about $1,850, students could pay their room and board and have money to spare.As the number of Saudi students grew, Kuwaiti students also began to arrive. Sales of Mustangs soared at a local car dealership. Abandoned storefronts downtown reopened with hookah lounges and Middle Eastern restaurants. Merchants and landlords relished the business. The economic impact has been humongous, said Dave Packer, the president of the Pocatello Rental Housing Association.But the students also brought unease. On campus, several professors said their colleagues chafed at the extra work required of them because of the poor English skills of many students who needed help after class. Some professors also believed the students did not have the proper math backgrounds for their chosen majors: A chart sent to the faculty by one dean revealed that in some classes with more than 20 Middle Eastern students, 90 percent of them had failed physics, 75 percent had failed introductory English, and more than 60 percent had failed math.David Rodgers, an associate dean of science and engineering, described the challenges many students have faced.In engineering, every single class is scripted, Dr. Rodgers said. Theres not a lot of room for a screw-up. If you fail a class, you can make it up perhaps by taking 18 hours the next semester. You know your funding is running out. You know youve come to America to be an engineer. The cultural change, the language barrier, all these things stress kids.That might explain why several professors said Middle Eastern students seemed prone to cheating and plagiarism. Eighty percent to 90 percent of the cheating cases reported in recent semesters in engineering and science have involved foreign students, Dr. Rodgers said.The university has bought antiplagiarism software, installed cameras, and gone so far as to track the Internet addresses of submitted papers, but Martin Hackworth, a departing physics lecturer, said the response was inadequate.Mr. Hackworth wrote a column in The Idaho State Journal last year with accusations that Middle Eastern students had cheated, and criticism that the university had accepted students who were unprepared.They viewed these students as A.T.M. machines, Mr. Hackworth said in an interview.While admitting that some Middle Eastern students had cheated, Ali Alheid, 22, a mechanical engineering major from Kuwait, complained that the university had painted all of them with a broad brush. They caught 20 or 30 students cheating, he said. Because of that, they treat us like cheaters. Professors and proctors have sometimes prohibited bathroom breaks during exams and looked between students legs for hidden cellphones.The cheating accusations are one reason Mr. Alnejidi is now telling friends not to come to Idaho State.The Saudi students are leaving because they feel they will not graduate under that level of scrutiny, he said.On a recent afternoon at the engineering school, groups of Middle Eastern students chatted outside. Inside, Saudi students worked in a basement laboratory on a virtual shield to protect United States borders from incursion, both by undocumented immigrants  and terrorists.Mr. Alheid said that at a gathering of students last month for Kuwaiti National Day, more than 100 signed a petition complaining of discrimination on campus and in town. He plans to transfer to Arizona State. They think we are terrorists, said Mr. Alheid, describing several episodes.As he drove his Mustang one night to a gym and tried to park, a car with an open door blocked his parking spot. When Mr. Alheid complained, he said, the man flashed a handgun at him. On another day, a middle finger was directed his way as he approached the newly built mosque, he said.While acknowledging instances of discrimination, officials and professors say some of the students have done little to adapt. Some have made inappropriate overtures toward women, according to the Police Department. Others have raced their sports cars on city streets and, unaccustomed to local laws, ignored speeding tickets.I dont think they understand that they have to pay a fine, said Zachary Parris, the chief deputy prosecutor, whose office held a seminar on campus to educate students on city ordinances.Jim Peterson, the deputy police chief, said, I would say they get away with a lot more here than they do at home.Things came to a head last May, when The Idaho State Journal reported price gouging by landlords, who defended the extra fees with claims that the Middle Eastern students had damaged apartments. Among the problems, according to the newspaper: carpets burned by hookahs.That is when Eva Nye, then a City Council member, wrote a column urging Pocatellans to be nicer to the students. By that time, the students were packing the mosque for Friday Prayer.It put some people on edge, and they felt certain that a jihad was going to occur in Pocatello, Ms. Nye said."}
{"text": "Gary Johnson has climbed Mount Everest before.This is not a metaphor about how hard it is to operate outside our two-party system. Its a real thing that a presidential candidate has done. It just happens to also work, you know, as a metaphor.Gary Johnson is the former Republican governor of New Mexico. During his two terms in office, he slashed the state budget while pushing for tax cuts, school vouchers and the legalization of marijuana. In 2003, after he left office, and shortly after breaking his leg, he climbed Mount Everest  the stuff of campaign ad makers dreams.Now, as the presumptive presidential nominee of the Libertarian Party, Mr. Johnson is facing another daunting task: getting attention, and votes, as a third-party presidential candidate.In a normal election year, Mr. Johnsons candidacy would garner about as much publicity and respect as any third-party candidates, which is to say, close to zero. But this time is different. The Republican Party appears to be eating its own tail, with millions of voters lining up for a candidate that many party leaders find morally and politically reprehensible. And now, in retaliation, some of those party leaders are starting to look for their own Naderian spoiler candidate to prevent Donald J. Trump from winning the presidency.Last Thursday, three influential conservative activists convened a meeting of anti-Trump Republicans in Washington to discuss the feasibility of running a third-party candidate. According to The Washington Post, the tone of the meeting was muted and downbeat  perhaps a sign of the resignation party elites are feeling as they realize Mr. Trump is likely to be their nominee.The anti-Trump, anti-Hillary Clinton crowd isnt out of options just yet. Some have suggested putting up an independent candidate, or going all in for Senator Ted Cruz. But an absurd, unpredictable election season sometimes merits an equally absurd, unpredictable response. Thats where Mr. Johnson comes in.As the Libertarian Partys presidential nominee in 2012, he won around 1 percent of the popular vote. If he somehow were elected president, he would be the first commander in chief to have posed shirtless in GQ and served as the chief executive of a medical cannabis company.Its unlikely that Republican elites would ever rally round someone like Mr. Johnson. But as a firewall to prevent Mr. Trump from taking over the Oval Office, the Libertarian Party nominee  whom they disagree with on many subjects  may be their best shot.The biggest hurdle anti-Trump Republicans must overcome, aside from finding a candidate willing to go into the wilderness for them, is getting on the ballot. The presidential election system is a patchwork of state deadlines and ballot requirements. Ralph Nader, who critics say helped usher George W. Bush into the White House by running as a Green Party candidate in 2000, is extremely familiar with the ballot requirements, having been booted off the Pennsylvania ballot in 2004. While Mr. Nader is happy to rail against the two-party tyranny of the American electoral system, he thinks starting a third-party run at this point in the election season a near-impossible goal.Its almost too late, unless youre a multibillionaire, Mr. Nader said. Other than just a tailored two- or three-state approach, I dont see it happening.Even if anti-Trump forces are able to put a third-party candidate on the ballot, it is a limited victory: Ensure Mr. Trump loses, while also ensuring Republicans split their votes and get another Democrat elected.After Mr. Johnson earns his partys nomination for a second time, which he appears likely to do, his key challenge will be making it to the debate stage. Last year, the Libertarian Party and the Green Party filed a lawsuit against the Commission on Presidential Debates to change the national polling threshold that dictates that only candidates polling at 15 percent or higher can join in.There is no way that a third party wins the presidency without being in the presidential debate, Mr. Johnson said. The contention is on our part that if youre on the ballot in enough states to mathematically be elected, then you should be included in the presidential debate.He pointed out that, unlike whichever independent candidate anti-Trump Republicans are thinking of putting up against Mr. Trump, the Libertarian Party  which will host its nominating convention in Orlando, Fla., over Memorial Day  will be on the ballot in all 50 states come November.Theres not another third party. Theres not. Its just not going to happen, he said, then added, It could be me!Mr. Trump has played the primary process masterfully, staging his coup from within the palace walls. He capitalized on the very rules the Republican National Committee changed after the drawn-out 2012 primary election to make more states award their delegates as winner-take-all rather than proportionally.Instead of ousting Mr. Trump and forcing him to run as a third-party candidate, Republican elites now find themselves, or their preferred candidates, losing control of their own party. After the meeting of anti-Trump conservatives last Thursday, one of the meetings organizers, the right-wing radio host Erick Erickson, put out a statement from the group.We intend to keep our options open as to other avenues to oppose Donald Trump, he wrote. Our multiple decades of work in the conservative movement for free markets, limited government, national defense, religious liberty, life and marriage are about ideas, not necessarily parties.It is noteworthy that Mr. Trump is running a campaign safely within the two-party system, considering he is a Voltron-like candidate built using the most successful parts of past independent campaigns.Like George Wallace, the former Alabama governor who ran a third-party presidential campaign in 1968 after his segregationist views put him on the fringes of the Democratic Party, Mr. Trump uses strident racial language to stoke his supporters anger. Like Ross Perot, who won 19 percent of the popular vote as an independent in 1992, Mr. Trump is an eccentric billionaire who is fun to watch on TV, which has allowed him to move ahead without relying on traditional fund-raising channels. Like Pat Buchanan, the Reform Party candidate in 2000, he is repackaging warmed-over economic and cultural nationalism and selling it as the future of the conservative movement. Mr. Trump even has a bit of Teddy Roosevelt, whose penchant for strongman bluster made him a populist hero when he ran as the Progressive (a.k.a. Bull Moose) Party candidate in 1912.For now, the Republican Partys leaders are trying to maintain some semblance of control over whats happening to them. Appearing on ABCs This Week on Sunday, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said it was both too early and too late for his party to think about starting an independent bid.The host, George Stephanopoulos, asked Mr. Priebus what he thought of the Stop Trump movement, and whether recruiting a third-party candidate would doom the Republican chances of winning back the White House. Well, sure it would  of course it would, he said. But it isnt likely, and its probably too late, and there is no definitive answer right now as to who the nominee is going to be of our party. So I think all of its far too early.Its Schrdingers primary now: both alive and dead, too early to speculate about and too late to save. Worst of all, the anti-Trump movements only hope to save the party might be a Libertarian. According to Julia Azari, a professor of political science at Marquette University, a Trump victory would actually prove worse for the Republican Party in the long run than another Democratic presidency.Parties are not just labels, theyre not just ideas, she said. Theyre institutions, and theyre institutions that do have people in them that have some sense of their longevity and also their integrity. Trump could run and lose, and the Republican Party could potentially move on from that. If he runs and wins, thats really the nightmare scenario.Mr. Johnson doesnt appear to be too concerned about the integrity of his former party, though he finds Mr. Trumps rise as maddening as the anti-Trump crowd does. Mr. Johnson cites his experience in 2012, where he ran for the Republican nomination before going after the Libertarian one: Thirty percent of Republicans believe the scourge of the earth is Mexican immigration, he said. It was my voice saying, Youre wrong. That theyre the cream of the crop when it comes to workers. That theyre not taking jobs that U.S. citizens want.He added: And the fence is crazy. Its asinine.The more he talks, the more the #NeverTrump forces might hear something they like.And Gary Johnson has a campaign slogan ready: It could be me!"}

Make it one of Rembrandts few works In 2015, a pipeline owned by Plains All American Pipeline sprung a leak that released 3,400 barrels of crude into the ocean, fouling several newly created marine protected areas.Use sprang for the simple past tense.There is, moreover, an authority to Viertels analysis; he knows from whence he speaks, given a background in dramaturgy (at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles), criticism (at The Los Angeles Herald Examiner) and producing (as the senior vice president of Jujamcyn Theaters).Well, whence means from where, so from whence is redundant. But the real problem is that we actually meant whereof, meaning of what.At Kansas, where he was known as the Great White Whale, he had been an all-American, averaging almost 25 points a game at a time when basketball was a slower, more low-scoring pursuit.Make it a slower, lower-scoring pursuit.The court papers said Ms. Sorrell had learned the dean had also harassed other women employees at the university.Avoid using women as a modifier like this. Make it female employees or something like women who worked at the university.Reese and Mara, who signs off on major purchases, did not spend without forethought Wednesday; each of the teams acquisitions were players the Giants had identified as priorities at their positions.Each is singular and doesnt work with were.

{"text": "CUPERTINO, Calif.  Apple held one of its regular product showcases on Monday, but this time the products did not take center stage.Before the Silicon Valley giant unveiled modest upgrades to its device lineup, Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, defended the companys stance in its fight with the federal government over the encryption on iPhones.The case had been expected to head to a court hearing on Tuesday, but the Justice Department abruptly moved on Monday to cancel the hearing, saying it might not need Apples help to break into the phone used by a gunman in last years San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting.In a news conference at Apples Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, Mr. Cook stressed that the company would stand fast. We need to decide as a nation how much power the government should have over our data and over our privacy, Mr. Cook said. This is an issue that impacts all of us, and we will not shrink from this responsibility.He said that Apple believed it had an obligation to help protect its users data. That belief eventually prompted Apple to fight the Justice Departments demand to help the government crack the encryption on the iPhone used by a terrorist in last years California attack.Compared to that high-stakes contest  which has broad implications for the technology industry, consumers and law enforcement  Apples new products were small ball.The company introduced smaller versions of its flagship iPhone and iPad devices, hoping to eke out more sales growth by filling gaps in its product lineup.The new devices, the iPhone SE and a 9.7-inch iPad Pro, represent a return to the form factors that prevailed before Apple supersized its smartphones in 2014 and added the large, business-oriented iPad Pro last year.Its clear that there is still some subset of the iPhone population that prefers a smaller phone, said Jan Dawson, chief analyst of Jackdaw Research, an independent consulting firm.Greg Joswiak, an Apple executive, said on stage that the company sold more than 30 million four-inch iPhones last year, and many iPhone users have been begging the company to update its phones of that size.So Apple upgraded the components of its new four-inch phone to largely match the speed and features of its flagship iPhone 6s, but at a lower price, starting at $399.Apple, which has a higher market value than any other company, is now so big that it is difficult for the company to come up with new products to drive a new wave of purchases. Its premium pricing  its larger phones typically run $650 or more  has also left it vulnerable to cheaper handsets that run on Googles Android software.In Apples first fiscal quarter, which ended on Dec. 26, its revenue grew just 2 percent, and the company has offered a cautious forecast for the year.The lack of must-have new features in Apples recent products has hurt sales growth, as many customers decided their older models were good enough and postponed upgrades, Mr. Dawson said.In a way, you see both devices that Apple is launching on Monday as drivers of an upgrade cycle, he said.Apple certainly hopes that fans of its four-inch phones will upgrade to the new iPhone SE, which packs a faster computer chip, a better camera, and Apples Touch ID and payment technology into the same four-inch case as the aging iPhone 5S.The new 9.7-inch iPad Pro brings some of the features of last years 12.9-inch iPad Pro, including a stylus, a keyboard and four speakers, to a tablet the size of the consumer-oriented 9.7-inch iPad Air 2. The new Pro will start at $599, and Apple also cut the price of the Air 2 by $100 to start at $399.The iPad Pros are particularly aimed at the hundreds of millions of users of old personal computers that run Microsoft Windows who might be looking to replace them, said Philip Schiller, Apples senior vice president of worldwide marketing.Apple also reduced the price of the Apple Watch by $50, to $299, and introduced new woven nylon wristbands for the device. More than one-third of Watch owners have more than one band, Mr. Cook said.Analysts say sales have been modest for the watch, which works as a companion to the iPhone. The price cut might encourage more people to give it a try. But Apple also acknowledges that the smartwatch category is in its infancy and it may take several more generations of the device before it really catches on.Apple also touted the iPhones potential usefulness in medical research and personal medical monitoring. It introduced new software on Monday to help developers create apps for both purposes, showcasing as an example a large project to study people with Parkinsons disease.Even then, Apple stressed its commitment to protecting customer data, saying that any sharing of health information would require a customers explicit permission.Nothing is more sensitive than your health data, said Jeff Williams, Apples chief operating officer."}
{"text": "An experimental dengue vaccine worked almost perfectly in a small trial in which volunteers were deliberately given a mild form of the disease, scientists said last week.The results in 41 volunteers were so encouraging that they justified starting a larger trial, now underway in Brazil. The vaccine was jointly developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and the Food and Drug Administration.In the study, published in Science Translational Medicine, 41 volunteers were given the vaccine, now named TV003, or a placebo.Six months later, all were challenged  deliberately infected  with a genetically modified strain of dengue virus from Tonga that can cause only mild disease.No replicating virus was found in the blood of any of the 21 volunteers who received the vaccine. Dengue was found in the blood of all 20 who had the placebo, and many developed signs of infection, such as rashes and low levels of white blood cells.Deliberate challenges are rare in testing vaccines for diseases that have no cure. Scientists must be certain that the infecting microbe is so weak that it cannot make volunteers dangerously ill.There are four dengue viruses, or serotypes, all spread by Aedes aegypti, the mosquito that spreads the Zika virus.Every year, nearly 400 million people around the world get dengue, more than are infected with any other mosquito-borne disease. Most recover and become immune to the first serotype they had.But about two million who later become infected with a different serotype develop dangerous hemorrhagic fevers, and about 25,000 die from them each year.One of several dengue vaccines in development, Dengvaxia, has recently been licensed in Mexico. But it offers relatively little protection against some serotypes and may make some young children who receive it more likely to be hospitalized years later.Dengue is unique, and if you dont do it right, you can do more harm than good, said Dr. Anna P. Durbin, a researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who led the testing of TV003.Because dengue is from the same family as the Zika virus, the techniques used to make TV003 might be applicable to a Zika vaccine, she said."}
{"text": "HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam  So Havana is 20 years behind Ho Chi Minh City on the development cycle that brings you bulldozed historical districts; traffic-clogged streets; a skyline of cranes; fancy golf courses for expats and the local elite; lattes galore; burger joints; smartphones everywhere; a middle class with disposable income; the seductions of credit; fragrant shopping malls; brand heaven (or hell); the end of virgin beaches; massive real estate developments with names like Central Park; offshore fortunes for the political architects of capitalist communism; resorts with their manicured lawns; casinos; mass tourism; social media; 6 percent annual growth; mom-and-pop entrepreneurship; suburbia and sprinklers; private schools for kids with Ivy League colleges already in their sights; Asian and Latin American versions of the American dream; and a population fired up and sort of freed by the opportunity to make a buck for the first time in generations.In Cubas case, come to think of it, the process will almost certainly go quicker. Its located closer to Miami. American hotel chains are already circling, or pouncing.The world has sped up since the mid-1990s, when Vietnam embarked on the opening that has fast-forwarded its economy over the past two decades. Like China, it has demonstrated that nothing fires up capitalism quite like Communist political control in 21st-century guise.Why should Ral Castros Cuba be different? Money trumps liberty, which can be cumbersome and erratic. Give Havana a mere decade and it will be well down the Ho Chi Minh City road.Over all, thats good for Cubans, yet the homogenizing effect of global commerce has become so familiar that its difficult to look at images of President Obama strolling the streets of Old Havana with his family and not feel  along with the thrill of this needed breakthrough  a twinge of ambivalence.It is a wonderful thing to have an American president in Cuba for the first time in almost nine decades, and equally wonderful to see the thawing of a half-century of American-Cuban hostility that had become anachronistic and pointless.But by now we know enough of how development can look  and how it can race ahead without accompanying political liberalization  to rejoice with some reserve. Cuba is certain to lose a fraction of its soul as money works its fascination. All the new malls may do nothing for the miserable fate of dissidents with democratic obsessions.Vietnam has been a remarkable success story. Annual trade with the United States has soared from a mere $220 million in 1994 to $29.6 billion in 2013. Four decades after the napalm, commerce has overcome enmity. America is a hedge against China; the temporary enemy has become a partner of sorts against the eternal enemy.The Vietnamese, their lives improving, express overwhelmingly positive views of America. Obama is expected here later this year to cement a new partnership important to the future of the United States as a China-offsetting power in Asia.It would be surprising if the Cuba opening did not produce similar rapid development and steady rapprochement with the United States. The Cuban revolution had its achievements, not least in education and medicine, but lost its raison dtre long ago. It was a generator of misery and paralysis on an epic scale  lives wasted, hopes quashed, youths reduced to idleness and inertia.The possibilities about to emerge for millions of Cubans are reason enough to say that, while its no panacea, the Obama-Castro entente is cause for celebration.When I was in Cuba eight years ago for the 50th anniversary of the revolution, I wrote: On my first day in Havana I wandered down to the Malecn, the worlds most haunting urban seafront promenade. A norte was blustering, sending breakers crashing over the stone dike built in 1901 under short-lived American rule. Bright explosions of spray unfurled onto the sidewalk.I was almost alone on a Sunday morning in Cubas capital city of 2.2 million people. A couple of cars a minute passed, often finned 50s beauties, Studebakers and Chevrolets, extravagant and battered. Here and there, a stray mutt scrounged. Washing flapped on the ornate ironwork balconies of crumbling mansions. Looking out on the ocean, I searched in vain for a single boat.Goodbye to all that. The imprisoning sea off Cuba will be imprisoning no more; it will grow dense with container ships and the masts of yachts before long. New buildings will rise and the old will be torn down. That is good, of course it is. Yet the global mall and tourist destination do leave something to be desired.You never know, as Vietnam and Cuba demonstrate. America loses a war against Communism in Southeast Asia, and in time capitalism triumphs.The white man is finished in Asia, said Ho Chi Minh. Well, not quite, as it transpired.A revolution is not a bed of roses, said Fidel Castro. Nor is the end of the revolution."}
{"text": "Alarmed by the harsh attacks and negative tone of their presidential contest, broad majorities of Republican primary voters view their party as divided and a source of embarrassment and think that the campaign is more negative than in the past, according to a New York Times/CBS News national poll released on Monday.The dismay has not set back their leading candidate, however. While about four in 10 Republican voters disapprove of how Donald J. Trump has handled the violence at some of his rallies, Mr. Trump has also picked up the most support recently as several rivals have left the race. Forty-six percent of primary voters said they would like to see Mr. Trump as the partys nominee, more than at any point since he declared his candidacy in June. Twenty-six percent favored Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and 20 percent backed Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.Fully three-quarters of Republican primary voters expect Mr. Trump to be their partys nominee.Compared with Republicans, far more Democratic primary voters see their side as unified and say the campaign has made them feel mostly proud of their party.Yet Democrats are more sharply divided over their candidates. Hillary Clinton has only a slight edge over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and growing numbers of Democratic primary voters are more excited about Mr. Sanders as their possible nominee. In the past month, the level of enthusiasm for Mrs. Clinton among Democratic voters has fallen eight percentage points to 40 percent, while it has grown for Mr. Sanders by 12 percentage points to 56 percent. Still, more than seven in 10 Democratic voters expect Mrs. Clinton to win the nomination.Mr. Sanders performs slightly better than Mrs. Clinton in hypothetical general-election matchups against Mr. Trump: The senator beats the real estate developer by 15 percentage points, while Mrs. Clinton prevails by 10 points. Mrs. Clinton holds a narrow edge over Mr. Cruz, while Mr. Kasich is the only Republican who has an advantage over Mrs. Clinton in November.With the state-by-state nominating contests about half over, Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton have pulled solidly ahead of their opponents in delegates. Yet they have also emerged as the cause of the most skepticism and negativity from the electorate nationwide as well as in their parties.Half of all voters said they would be scared if Mr. Trump were elected president, and another 19 percent said they would be concerned. Mrs. Clinton does not fare much better: Thirty-five percent of all voters said they would be scared if Mrs. Clinton won in November, and 21 percent said they would be concerned.Charles Shank, 65, a Kasich supporter, said in a follow-up interview that he was disconcerted by Mr. Trumps personality and childish games and feared that he would not be an effective commander in chief or negotiator with Congress.He scares me because hes a loudmouthed bully, Mr. Shank said. He doesnt come across as presidential. He says I will, and I got news for him, he isnt being elected king. He doesnt have the ultimate power.The nationwide telephone poll was conducted March 17 to 20 on cellphones and landlines with 1,252 adults, of which 1,058 said they were registered voters, including 362 Republican primary voters and 388 Democratic primary voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all adults; four points for all voters; six points for Republican primary voters; and six points for Democratic primary voters.Among Democrats, doubts persist about Mrs. Clinton, with 40 percent of her own partys primary voters saying she is not honest and trustworthy. She is viewed unfavorably by 52 percent of all voters, among the highest percentage since the question was first asked during the 1992 presidential race.I think shell say whatever she needs to to get elected, and what she says may not be what shes planning to do, said Patricia Lawrence, 55, a Philadelphia Democrat who is supporting Mr. Sanders. I was concerned already when she was first lady, though I dont know what it is. I just dont know, and when we find out, it may be too late.Anxieties run higher among Republicans in large part because of the ferocious and at times juvenile nature of the insult-laden campaign, which has featured taunts over character and even manhood as much as serious policy debates. About six in 10 Republican primary voters say the overall tone of their partys nomination fight has been more negative than in past campaigns, while only one in 10 Democratic primary voters hold the same view of their partys campaign. And 60 percent of Republican primary voters said the campaign had made them feel mostly embarrassed about their party, while only 13 percent of Democratic primary voters expressed that opinion.The potential for political chaos on the Republican side is also intensifying the unease among primary voters. Facing the possibility that no candidate will win enough delegates to clinch the nomination by the end of the primaries in June, two-thirds of Republican voters said it would bad for the party if the nominee were chosen at a contested Republican convention in July.Mr. Trumps supporters were particularly apt to say so: Nearly nine in 10 said a contested convention would be bad for the party, far more than Cruz and Kasich supporters.The will of the people has been Donald Trump, and if the party wont support him, they are not supporting the will of the people, said Bryan Ottalini, 59, a Trump supporter from Stone Mountain, Ga. I think it would be a definite deal killer for me as far as being a Republican. I would never vote Republican again.Mr. Trump has suggested that riots would break out among his supporters if he went into the convention with a solid delegate lead but party leaders denied him the nomination  one in a series of remarks tied to violence that have worried Americans. Sixty-four percent of all voters said they disapproved of how Mr. Trump had handled the physical clashes at some of his rallies.As for who is to blame for the episodes, 29 percent of all voters blame protesters at the rallies, 23 percent blame Trump supporters, and 43 percent blame both equally.More than eight in 10 Democratic primary voters have a favorable opinion of their party, but they remain torn over their choices. While Mr. Sanders is regarded as more honest and trustworthy, 78 percent of Democratic voters say Mrs. Clintons policy proposals are realistic, compared with 56 percent who regard Mr. Sanderss proposals as such.Both parties have work to do with political independents. Seventy percent of them have a negative view of the Republican Party, and 55 percent are critical of the Democratic Party. Mr. Trump, a political outsider, and Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist who is not a registered Democrat, have performed particularly well among these voters in the primaries so far."}
{"text": "I wanted to write a follow-up to my Sunday column on the Republican leadershipsseemingly-frozen response to the rise of Donald Trump, but I see that Yuval Levin has already covered many of the points I hopedto make. So Ill just recommend his whole post, and quote fromthe part that addresses the arguments Ive heard from many people in the know explaining why prominent Republicans, from Paul Ryan on down, are wary of being too forthright about the depth of their opposition to Trump:The idea, as I understand it, is that expressing firm opposition to Trump or support for Ted Cruz would be counterproductive, because it would suggest that the party or the establishment (or whatever) is opposed to Trump and supporting Cruz, and nothing could be better for Trump or worse for Cruz. Ive heard this now from a number of members of Congress, from a smaller number of conservative activist types, even from one of the people who ran for president earlier in this cycle. The argument presents itself as a kind of exercise in political savvyas if, well, we all know what voters think of the establishment nowadays and we had better not make it look like the establishment wants to undermine Trump. my sense is that this form of the argument for silence isnt really a failed attempt at sophisticated politicking but is rather an expression of an exaggerated form of the hard-earned self-doubt of Republicans in this political season: The last several months have left people feeling like theyre living in some kind of opposite world, where up is down and wrong is right, so maybe criticizing Trump will only help him.Whatever is behind it, the awfully convoluted theory that the best way to avoid helping Trump is to avoid criticizing him seems pretty ridiculous. There is really not much evidence behind the proposition that Trump is impervious to old fashioned criticism and attack. He hasnt been subjected to very much of it at all. And the notion that you shouldnt tell voters the truth about him as you understand it isnt exactly a show of respect to Republican voters, or a demonstration of any keen understanding of the different types of voters who might be considering Trump. Most important, though, the case against Trump given all that we have seen in this election cycle and all that we can discern of his character and record, is more than a tactical case. Trump is singularly ill-suited and unprepared for the job he is seeking, and he is making a mockery of what conservatives have argued, accomplished, and sought to achieve in recent decades. He invites the right to succumb to a shallow caricature of itself and to turn its prospects, and the nations, over to someone who shows not the slightest inkling of concern for the Constitution, the limits of government power, the freedom of the individual, or the traditions and principles of the American republiclet alone any prudence, discipline, or vision. To those who are angry, he offers only his own anger; to those led to hopelessness by a loss of faith in our institutions, he offers only affirmation that there can be no hope except himself, the maker of great deals; to those who feel insecure, he offers only himself as a model of how to pass off insecurity as confidenceand we should hardly be surprised that the example leads some of those around him to violence. Every nerve and sinew of the conservative political tradition in America cries out against the dangers of such demagoguery. And anyone who thinks that voters should be warned against it ought to offer that warning.I made a version of this point after Mitt Romneys big anti-Trump speech, when there was a wave of sophisticated commentary about how Romney wasa lousy messenger whose stand would only help Trump win. Thatargument doesnt soundcrazy when you first hear it, and it wasnt crazy months and months ago, back when Trump seemed like he might deflate on his own. But since there is no perfect anti-Trump messenger, sinceevery prominent Republican is in some sense part of the establishment that heis successfully railing against, the argument eventually carries you toa kind of ludicrous fatalism, in which the rogues and opportunists and has-beens of the G.O.P. rally noisily around the Donald, but the partys more capable and honorable public servantsare supposed to lie back and hope the hostile takeover somehow fails without saying much of anythingbeyond the occasional dont go too far, Donald  interjection.What might they do instead? Well, for instance:In two weeks Wisconsin will hold its Republican presidential primary. Wisconsin is the home of Paul Ryan; it is also the home of Scott Walker (perhaps youve heard of him). It shouldnt be a great state for Trump demographically, and its one of the places where a loss would substantially reduce his chances of reaching the delegate threshold required to be the nominee. But its also a place where its easy to imagine John Kasich getting 24 percent of the vote, Ted Cruz getting 36 percent, and Trump walking away a narrow winner yet again. Which makes it ripe, one would think, for a Romney-style intervention on Cruzs behalf not even a full endorsement, if that seems a bridge too far, but just a tactical one; theycan go campaign for Kasich in New York and Connecticut and the Bay Areaafterward if they must from the states leading Republican politicians, becauseeven if that intervention didnt peel a single vote away from Trump it still might help Cruz consolidate the votes he needs to win outright, and make a contested convention considerably more likely.Will we get such an intervention? Maybe from Walker; I have no idea. But not from Ryan, it would seem, not least because he feels that his role as the G.O.P.convention chairman requires him to be Switzerland in the campaign as well as on the stage in Cleveland.Which, normally, would be the right and honorable course. But nothing is normal aboutthe Trump whirlwind, and talking about the importance of neutrality when Trump is busy warning about riots if he loses feels like a painfulcategory error, an attempt to maintaina facade of normalcy at the expense of acknowledging whats obviouslyhappening right in front of you.Or so it seems to me, at least. Theironyis that I say all this as someone who has little love for the Republican Partyas it currently exists, who was initially happy with the prospect of some Trumpian creative destruction, who might ultimately prefer the party that (eventually) emerged from the post-Trump rubble to what we have right now. So Im not sure what it says thatI (and not a few others in the reform-minded conservative commentariat) now seem to feel more urgency about stopping Trump than the men who actually lead the actual-existing G.O.P.That we enjoy the liberty of punditry rather than wearing the manacles of politics is no doubt part of it. Still, since pundits are also prone to overreaction, its important to keep in the mind the possibility that were wrong, that were being hysterical, that Trumps progress isnt a good reason to suspend the normal rules of politics or deliberatelysplitthe party orotherwise go to anti-Trump extremes.And I try to keep that possibility in mind. But you know, read the transcript of Donald Trumps meeting with the Washington Post editorial board. Just read it. This is from yesterday, less than twenty-four hours before the atrocity in Brussels. This is the man who will be the Republican nominee for president, representing the party of Eisenhower and Nixon and Reagan and George H.W. Bush, at a moment when the Western/liberal order is more fragile than its been since 1991.And of all the leaders of the Republican Party, all the men and women who hold high office, is history really going torecord that this demagogic, blathering clownwas opposed forthrightly and absolutely only by a defeated presidentialnominee, a Senate backbencher, and a retired Senatorlately recovered from cancer?

Then there is the annual World Happiness Report, released last week.This one consistently sparks interest beyond the usual coterie of diplomats and foreign-policy wonks. Happiness is a universal aspiration.This year we learn that happiness, like another precious commodity, oil, is not evenly distributed across the globe. Some nations are awash in bliss (see: Denmark), others bone dry (see: Burundi).Every year, happiness rankings capture our imagination. Like sports scores, everyone wants to know how the home team fared. (The United States, according to the United Nations, ranks 13th out of 157 countries.)Do these rankings really mean anything? Not if youre a happiness researcher, it turns out.For us, thats the least important data, said John F. Helliwell, a professor emeritus of economics at the University of British Columbia and one of the new reports co-authors.What really intrigues Dr. Helliwell and other happiness researchers is not where people are happy but why. The U.N. report identifies six key factors: G.D.P. per capita, life expectancy, social support, trust, generosity and perceived freedom to make life decisions.This year, the report also examined, for the first time, the question of happiness inequality. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, happiness levels are evenly distributed. That is, most Dutch people are more or less equally happy, as measured in self-reported surveys.In other nations, particularly those in the Middle East and Latin America, happiness levels vary tremendously. (Unequal income levels explain some, but not all, of the variation.)This inequity matters, the report concludes, because new research suggests that people are significantly happier living in societies where there is less inequality of happiness.In other words, we can achieve only so much happiness if our neighbors are miserable.Which raises an intriguing question: Can you redistribute happiness?Yes, you can, Dr. Helliwell said, and less painfully than redistributing income. Its possible to boost someone elses happiness without subtracting from your own.In fact, several studies have found that acting altruistically makes a person happier. Its one of those win-win games that everyone is looking for, Dr. Helliwell said.The U.N. report is good news for Bhutan, the nation where happiness is most evenly distributed. No great surprise there: The tiny Himalayan nation single-handedly sparked interest in global bliss with its well publicized measurements of Gross National Happiness.And while the countrys prime minister recently said he plans to dial back this approach, the seeds have been exported and planted around the world and now they are growing vigorously, Dr. Helliwell said.The U.K. and France are both actively pursuing ways to translate happiness data into public policy. Last month, the United Arab Emirates appointed a minister of happiness, the first such position in the Middle East, part of an effort to improve its well-being ranking (currently a not terrible 28th).This fascination with the scorecard rankles some happiness researchers, but not Dr. Helliwell, who views them as a kind of loss leader.It gets people in the store, and once theyre in the store they become interested in asking, Well, what makes for better lives? he said."}
{"text": "In another blow to a beleaguered institution, the English National Opera announced on Tuesday that Mark Wigglesworth would resign as its music director, just months after starting in the position in the fall. The company said in a news release that Mr. Wigglesworth feels unable to continue as music director despite the best efforts of the board and senior management to persuade him to remain.The announcement comes days after the company arrived at a labor agreement with its chorus, which included pay cuts, layoffs, and a move to nine-month contracts from yearlong ones, reflecting the companys plans to curtail its performance season at the London Coliseum. Mr. Wigglesworth wrote in the Guardian last month that the operas identity as a team defines its past and will be its greatest asset in protecting its future.Cutting the core of the company  musicians and technicians alike, he continued, would damage it irreparably.The English National Operas funding from Arts Council England, its source of public money, has been reduced by around 30 percent in recent years. Its chief executive, Cressida Pollock, a management consultant, was hired in March 2015 after the departures of its chairman and executive director. She has unveiled plans for more off-site performances and for an emphasis on works with broader appeal, like Andrew Lloyd Webbers musical Sunset Boulevard, starring Glenn Close, which opens in April. The companys artistic director, John Berry, left at the end of last season.The news release said that Mr. Wigglesworth would continue as music director until the end of the season; conduct a production of Janaceks Jenufa, opening in June; and return for two operas next season."}
{"text": "RIVERSIDE, Calif.  The Justice Department said on Monday that it might no longer need Apples assistance in opening an iPhone used by a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., rampage last year.The disclosure led a judge to postpone a court hearing over the issue and temporarily sidesteps what has become a bitter clash with the worlds most valuable publicly traded company.In a new court filing, the government said an outside party had demonstrated a way for the F.B.I. to possibly unlock the phone used by the gunman, Syed Rizwan Farook. The hearing in the contentious case  Apple has loudly opposed opening the iPhone, citing privacy concerns and igniting a heated debate  was originally set for Tuesday.While the Justice Department must test this method, if it works it should eliminate the need for the assistance from Apple, it said in its filing. The Justice Department added that it would file a status report by April 5 on its progress.The change is a reprieve in the clash that has erupted over how and when the authorities should use the troves of digital data collected and stored by tech companies. The two sides have traded barbs over the issue since last month, when Apple received a court order demanding that the company weaken the security of the iPhone so law enforcement officials could gain access to the data in it.The case has been viewed as a watershed moment in the debate over privacy and security.Apple had opposed the court order, arguing that it would be a slippery slope that could force the company to open many iPhones, thus compromising the privacy of its customers and the strength of its product security. President Obama said this month that the law enforcement authorities must be able to legally collect information from smartphones and other devices, adding that he opposed the stance on encryption taken by tech companies like Apple.Late on Monday, Judge Sheri N. Pym, the federal magistrate judge in the United States District Court for the Central District of California who was set to hold the hearing, agreed to grant the Justice Departments motion to postpone the hearing.The emergence of a potential third-party method to open the iPhone was a surprise, as the government said more than a dozen times in court filings that it could open the phone only with Apples help. The F.B.I. director, James B. Comey Jr., also reiterated that point several times during a hearing before Congress on March 1.The new method could forestall, but is unlikely to entirely head off, a showdown between Silicon Valley and the Justice Department over encryption.This will only delay an inevitable fight over whether the government can force Apple to break the security of its devices, said Alex Abdo, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, an advocacy group.For the Justice Department, cracking the iPhone would be a mixed blessing. While it would give investigators access to data that they see as crucial to a terrorism investigation, it would cut short the encryption debate that the F.B.I. had been trying to start for years before the Apple case came along.While contentious, the Apple case neatly crystallized that debate in a way that abstract discussions never had. The court fight, regardless of its outcome, would have increased the likelihood that Congress took up legislation to address the issue. Shelving the San Bernardino case could remove a sense of immediacy on the topic.The case could flare anew in court if the third-party method for opening the iPhone falters. In a conference call late Monday, a federal law enforcement official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity, said the government legally had to explore all outside methods of opening up the iPhone. If the government exhausted those options, then it could turn back to the courts to compel Apple to help open the device.The law enforcement official declined to name the outside party that approached investigators with a possible method for opening the phone. He said that investigators were cautiously optimistic about getting data from the phone, but that further testing is required.The government has been using the All Writs Act, a legal statute that dates to 1789, as a key underpinning of its case.The issue at hand is whether the government can use the All Writs Act to force an unwilling third party, Apple, to create what it claims is a back door, said Joseph DeMarco, a former federal prosecutor who filed a brief on behalf of law enforcement groups that supported the Justice Department in this case.  But if it can find a willing third party to break into the phone, then the All Writs Act argument is moot.In a statement, Melanie Newman, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said the F.B.I. had continued to work on ways to gain access to the contents of the iPhone used by Mr. Farook, even as the fight between Apple and the government was unfolding.A senior Apple executive, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity late Monday, said should the government fail to unlock the phone and continue its fight with the company, Apple would want to know more about the outside party that has claimed it can break into the iPhone, in order to learn what methods could circumvent the companys security features. The executive said that Apple had no knowledge of what capability the government might soon have and that it learned about it on Monday.In the meantime, Apple has continued to repeat its message of privacy. At a product event on Monday at the companys Cupertino, Calif., headquarters, Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, emphasized a philosophy of helping to protect users data.This is an issue that impacts all of us and we will not shrink from this responsibility, Mr. Cook said."}

{"text": "WEDNESDAY PUZZLE  Its possible to overthink a theme, and today I did just that. Maybe you did, too. I have to say that I honestly didnt see this one coming. Bravo to Alex Boisvert and Jeff Chen for pushing the envelope, because I dont believe that anyone else has taken this type of theme this far.This is one of those puzzles where you finish and then spend some time staring at the grid, trying to figure out what hath been wrought. When I got TRIPLE TIME for the revealer, Minuet meter  I first thought that maybe the starred theme entries could be read aloud in syllabic beats that matched a minuet meter.That was wrong, of course. The real schtick here is that each word in each of the three-word theme phrases can be followed by the word TIME. At 17 Across, for example, we have the entry NEXT DAY AIR, which can be broken down into NEXT TIME, DAYTIME, and AIR TIME.The reason thats so impressive is that weve seen this X can follow Y theme many times before in two-word phrases, but I dont believe weve ever seen a triple before. Thats incredibly hard to do, and this puzzle is evidence that technology helps when it comes to construction. Mr. Boisvert wrote a program to help pull this theme together (see Mr. Chens notes below) and, while its possible that it could have been developed without the aid of a computer program, I can see how it is a tool that makes the job a lot easier. Making sure the entries are sparkling and lively still takes a human eye, though. Thank goodness.I liked how all four of the theme entries are also debuts in and of themselves, giving the puzzle that extra-fresh feeling. LOVE HOTEL is another great debut, and the fairly obscure word PAWLS comes back after a 27-year hiatus.In clue news, I really enjoyed the two It becomes its own synonym when  clues, because it was a nice break from the other straightforward crossword clues. Introducing a different type of clue to a crossword always makes the solving more interesting in my book.Lets hear from Mr. Chen about this interesting puzzle:Jeff Chen: Ive always been impressed by Alex. I first encountered his work when I got tired of formatting my New York Times crossword submissions by hand. It was such a relief to find his puz2pdf app, making my crossword life a lot easier. Another of his programs helps search for theme entries fitting the both words can follow X theme type.The latter program made me curious  could he somehow write code to find answers where all THREE words can follow X? Im a little tired of the both words can follow X trope, but I thought it would be really neat if we could up the ante.Turns out it was a trivial task for him. We tried a few different key words, and when we hit upon time, the list was long enough that it felt like we could mine it for good answers. Alex was rightfully skeptical when I mentioned how much I liked LONG LOST FATHER as an entry, but a little soap opera research (its such a common trope) made us both happy with it. The grid work did take us a LONG (time). Apparently FATHER (time) is taking his toll on me.A lot of fun to work with Alex on this! Now, whos going to be the first to find an all FOUR words follow X theme ?Anyone want to accept Mr. Chens challenge? While youre contemplating that, lets move on to the Thursday puzzle with some Pink Floyd:Your thoughts?"}
{"text": "JERUSALEM   They landed in Israel late at night  a man in a dark suit and traditional headdress, wheeling a suitcase; a mother, veiled, in a long black robe and holding a sleeping toddler; and a rabbi carrying a Torah scroll believed to be more than 500 years old.They were among a final group of 19 Yemeni Jews who were spirited out of their war-torn country in recent days, the Jewish Agency for Israel announced on Monday, bringing a monthslong clandestine rescue operation to a close.Photographs taken at Ben-Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv by a representative of the Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental body that deals with Jewish immigration, documented the arrival late Sunday of the last of the Yemeni Jews who wanted to go to Israel.They are remnants of an ancient and once-vibrant group that became increasingly imperiled by violence and anti-Semitism as Yemen descended into civil war.From Operation Magic Carpet in 1949 until the present day, the Jewish Agency has helped bring Yemenite Jewry home to Israel, Natan Sharansky, a former Soviet dissident who is the chairman of the agency, said in a statement. He was referring to the airlifts of 1949 and 1950 that brought nearly 50,000 Yemenite Jews to Israel soon after the country was established.This chapter in the history of one of the worlds oldest Jewish communities is coming to an end, Mr. Sharansky added, but Yemenite Jewrys unique, 2,000-year-old contribution to the Jewish people will continue in the state of Israel.Roughly 50 Jews chose to remain in Yemen, including about 40 who live in a closed compound in the countrys capital, Sana, where they are protected by the Yemeni authorities, according to the Jewish Agency.The latest immigrants included a group of 14 from the northern Yemeni town of Raida, including the local rabbi, and a family of five from Sana.Exactly how they reached Israel, which has no diplomatic relations with Yemen, largely remains a mystery. Two countries that long facilitated Jewish emigration from Yemen, the United States and Britain, closed their embassies in Sana last year, as did many other Western countries.Saudi Arabia, which has no formal diplomatic relations with Israel, has imposed a naval and air blockade of Yemen. All traffic to and from Yemen is supposed to be checked by the Saudis, including flights, which stop in Saudi Arabia for inspection while traveling to or from Sana.It was not clear whether the Yemeni Jews had left by air or sea for the first leg of their journey. Israeli officials remained tight-lipped on the subject, possibly to protect the route in case the Jews who remained behind decide at a later date to emigrate.Arielle Di Porto, the director of Jewish immigration from distressed countries at the Jewish Agency, who coordinated the journey of the Yemeni Jews and met them upon their arrival in Israel, said only that the recent immigrants had not arrived on an Israeli plane.The new arrivals were taken to a so-called absorption center in the southern Israeli city of Beersheba, and they have been reunited with relatives.The family from Sana that arrived late Sunday is related to Aharon Zindani, who was killed in what was believed to be an anti-Semitic attack in 2012, the agency said. It said that it had arranged for Mr. Zindanis wife and children to emigrate soon after his murder, and that it had arranged for Mr. Zindanis remains to be brought to Israel for burial.Yehuda Sharf, the Jewish Agencys director of immigration and absorption, said there were no longer any Jews in Raida, where a Jewish teacher, Moshe Yaish Nahari, was shot and killed by a Yemeni Air Force pilot in 2008.All the Jews of Raida, Yemen, are with us, Mr. Sharf told Israel Radio on Monday, even the last Torah scroll."}
{"text": "The super PAC supporting Hillary Clinton is preparing to reserve roughly $70 million in television ads to begin after the Democratic National Convention and to run through the fall general election in important battleground states such as Ohio and Florida, the first large-scale mobilization that any group has made.Over the coming days, the group, Priorities USA, will begin making reservations in those states, as well as in Colorado, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and Virginia, said the groups chief strategist and co-chairman, Guy Cecil. The aggressive move comes as the super PAC looks to the fall and what could be a crowded market of television ad reservations.But it emphasizes a level of preparedness at a time when Republicans remain deeply fractured over their prohibitive front-runner, Donald J. Trump. And while they are sticking with the traditional general election battlegrounds for now, they are leaving open the possibility of expanding to other states.Saying that Republicans have been preparing for a billion-dollar campaign to distort Hillary Clintons record, Mr. Cecil added, Hillarys campaign is not taking anything for granted, including the primary, which is why its even more important that we prepare for the long road ahead to November.He added: We have learned a valuable lesson from Republicans during the primary. We cannot take Donald Trump or any other Republican nominee for granted. It will take an unprecedented campaign and independent effort to communicate, register, mobilize, and turn out voters. Theres no time to waste.The group is preparing for either Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. And Priorities USA is also likely to be on the air before the Democratic convention in late July. The groups strategists are trying to determine what can be gleaned from what was effective, and what wasnt, in the Republicans efforts to derail Mr. Trump.But the $70 million is strictly for the postconvention ad buy, and that does not cover a radio and digital advertising component. By buying time early, Priorities USA hopes to target its advertising to precise shows, and, to potentially lock in better ad rates."}
{"text": "DONETSK, Russia  A Russian court sentenced a Ukrainian military pilot, Lt. Nadiya V. Savchenko, to 22 years in prison on Tuesday after finding her guilty of complicity in the deaths of two Russian journalists, in a politically charged case that highlighted the strained relations between Moscow and the West.When the judge began to read out the sentence, Lieutenant Savchenko started to sing a song in Ukrainian. The judge had to stop the proceedings for at least five minutes. The hearing was interrupted again later, after people in the crowd began to sing the Ukrainian anthem.Simply put, Lieutenant Savchenko did not get a fair trial, and so her conviction is unsound and should not stand, Hugh Williamson, the Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.There should be justice for the deaths of Kornelyuk and Voloshin, but justice wont be served by an unfair trial that was highly politicized from the start, he said, referring to the two journalists, Igor Kornelyuk and Anton Voloshin.After the sentencing, Ukraines president, Petro O. Poroshenko, said he was willing to speak with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia about exchanging Lieutenant Savchenko for two Russian servicemen captured in Ukraine, whom he did not name.President Putin said he would return Nadiya V. Savchenko to Ukraine after the so-called court decision, Mr. Poroshenko said in a statement published on his website. Now, it is time to fulfill that promise.Mr. Putins spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, told the Interfax news agency that only the Russian president could make such a decision.The Donetsk City Court said Lieutenant Savchenko had directed mortar fire at a rebel-held checkpoint, resulting in the deaths of two Russian reporters during the height of the fighting in eastern Ukraine in June 2014.Donetsk, a small Russian town 520 miles south of Moscow, near the Ukrainian border, shares a name with the larger city in eastern Ukraine that is the center of the separatist movement. The area around the courthouse was cordoned off by special police units wearing masks.The pilot, considered a martyr in Ukraine and elected to Parliament there in absentia, has denied all charges. She has said that Russia kidnapped her an hour before Mr. Kornelyuk and Mr. Voloshin were killed, and that she was spirited across the border to Russia to face a show trial.In Russia, the state news media has turned Lieutenant Savchenko into a symbol of violent anti-Russian nationalism in Ukraine. Russia also said she had entered the country on her own accord, and she was also convicted of illegal entry.At the trial, her lawyers and others raised serious problems with the evidence. Lieutenant Savchenkos lawyers offered cellphone records indicating that she was at least three miles from the shelling site when it took place.Then, in an interview published on Monday by Meduza.io, a news website, a rebel leader said he had captured Lieutenant Savchenko before the shelling that killed the Russian journalists. The rebel identified himself by a military nickname, Ilim.The West and Ukraine have said the case amounted to the latest in a long series of show trials, and President Obama and several European leaders were among the critics.In a telephone call to Mr. Putin last week, Mr. Obama urged him to release Lieutenant Savchenko. Mr. Putin rejected the request, saying he could not interfere in the judicial process, according to a statement by Mr. Peskov.Several Western and Ukrainian diplomats were on hand to hear the verdict, as were some of Lieutenant Savchenkos relatives; a dozen supporters, including members of the Ukrainian Parliament; and a small army of reporters.Lieutenant Savchenko will not appeal the courts decision because she does not believe Russian courts can judge her fairly, said her lead lawyer, Mark Feygin. She also asked her lawyers to announce that she would go on a hunger strike 10 days after the verdict, when it comes into force. She has gone on hunger strikes several times before, including this month."}
{"text": "THE Supreme Court will hear a second challenge to the Affordable Care Acts contraceptive mandate on Wednesday in a case called Zubik v. Burwell. The plaintiffs want to extend the 2014 ruling in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, which recognized the right of certain for-profit companies to a religious exemption from the acts requirement that employers health plans provide contraceptive coverage.This time, the objection comes from a handful of religious nonprofits that argue that the governments religious exemption itself infringes on their religious freedom. The groups contend that filling out a one-page form or sending a letter to the government to get the exemption amounts to facilitation of sin because it starts a process that ultimately allows employees to get contraception though a third party.This case is one of several recent conflicts in which one side seeks to use its religious objections to undermine laws that promote equality. The position taken by the plaintiffs in Zubik recalls the refusal last year by a Kentucky county clerk to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Courts marriage-equality ruling.At first, Zubik might not look like the Kentucky showdown, but there is a similar dynamic at play. The real issue at stake in reproductive rights cases, as Ruth Bader Ginsburg put it in 1978, paraphrasing another scholar when she was herself a professor, is whether women are to have the opportunity to participate in full partnership with men in the nations social, political and economic life.In dismissing one of the claims that the Supreme Court will hear oral argument about on Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia made a similar point: For most women, whether and under what circumstances to bear a child is the most important economic decision of their lives. An unintended pregnancy is virtually certain to impose substantial, unplanned-for expenses and time demands on any family, and those demands fall disproportionately on women.Access to reproductive care is central to equality between the sexes. By requiring employers health plans to provide contraceptive coverage, the Affordable Care Act represents an important legislative link between sex equality and reproductive rights. Before it was passed, women were paying more for health care than men largely because of the cost of reproductive health coverage.Congress made a deeper commitment to anti-discrimination rights in health care in another provision of the Affordable Care Act that is not under review in this case. Section 1557 gives patients an opening to sue in federal court if they experience discrimination at the hands of health care providers, insurers or other related programs. In defining the forbidden forms of sex discrimination, the law implicitly includes pregnancy discrimination. By doing so, the provision connects womens reproductive capacity to equality between the sexes.In the Affordable Care Act, Congress extended federal anti-discrimination protections for the first time to reproductive-age women at hospitals, community health centers and residential treatment centers, and in insurance markets. In that way, the law represents a profound commitment to the idea that the inability to gain access to health care, including reproductive care, can be a form of discrimination. The statute recognizes different bodies  womens bodies  as deserving of equal care in ways that, to date, the Supreme Court has not.In fact, the Supreme Court has repeatedly failed to see how womens access to reproductive care has implications for their status as legal equals. This is partly, perhaps, an accident of history: The court considered contraception before it articulated a constitutional right to be free from state-sanctioned sex discrimination. This may be one reason the court originally struck down state bans on contraception through privacy-based reasoning rather than equality-based reasoning.But the Supreme Courts blindness to the implications for womens equality in its rulings on reproductive rights persisted. In 1974, in Geduldig v. Aiello, the court rejected the constitutional sex discrimination claims of female employees who had been denied coverage for pregnancy-related disabilities under their state-issued insurance. Unfavorable treatment based on pregnancy, the court reasoned, didnt count as sex discrimination because the policy did not distinguish between women and men, but between pregnant women and nonpregnant persons, as though pregnancy had nothing to do with sex. The court doubled down two years later in General Electric Company v. Gilbert, denying the same claims under Title VII, the federal law that bans sex discrimination in employment.The Supreme Court appeared to walk back its formalistic view, first in Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, the 1992 abortion case, when it reasoned that the ability of women to participate equally in the economic and social life of the nation has been facilitated by their ability to control their reproductive lives, and then in Nevada Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs in 2003, when it recognized that gender-neutral family-leave protections promoted womens work-force participation by decoupling reproductive capacity from child care. But in 2012, in Coleman v. Maryland Court of Appeals, the court failed to see how other federal leave policies furthered the same interest.And again in Hobby Lobby, the court did not see the refusal to provide contraception as sex discrimination, in part because women could theoretically still get coverage by the alternate procedure that is being challenged in Zubik.Nonetheless, the majority maintained that while some employers could opt out of providing contraception on religious grounds, the holding did not provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious practice.But federal laws, repeatedly repudiating the courts limited view of sex equality, emphasize that sex discrimination is exactly whats at stake. The back-and-forth started a few years after the courts rulings in Geduldig and Gilbert, when Congress passed a law to ensure that federal workplace protections defined sex discrimination to include pregnancy discrimination. This more robust definition of sex discrimination also applies to students through regulations under Title IX. The Affordable Care Act is the latest law in this tradition to recognize the implications for sexual equality of reproductive care.Difficult questions surely arise when reproductive rights conflict with religious beliefs. But as it weighs religious objections to contraception coverage, the Supreme Court should recognize that it is only when womens health care rights are fully recognized by the law that women can participate in society as equals."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  The group that is seeking to wrest the genetics analysis company Affymetrix from Thermo Fisher Scientific raised its bid for the company on Tuesday to $17 a share, escalating the takeover battle.The new bid by Origin Technologies, a shell company run by former Affymetrix executives and backed by a Chinese private equity firm, is up from an original proposal of $16.10 a share. Thermo Fisher agreed in January to pay $14 a share for Affymetrix.Origin also said that it had raised the size of a reverse termination fee payable to Affymetrix to $100 million from $75 million.Affymetrix rejected Origins initial bid, questioning the groups financing. Thermo Fisher quickly weighed in, arguing that Origins bid would not survive regulatory review, in part because of its support by SummitView Capital, a Chinese private equity firm.Ultimately, Origins executives hope to merge Affymetrix with their current genetics analysis provider, Centrillion Technology Holdings.On Monday, Origin responded, arguing that it could close a takeover of Affymetrix quickly and repeating its contention that any such deal would not require review by the government panel that reviews transactions for national security issues.Shareholders in Affymetrix are scheduled to vote on the Thermo Fisher deal on Thursday, and Thermo Fisher hopes to close that transaction quickly afterward."}
{"text": "The CIT Group has taken a late grip on John Thains pay.The company, a $7 billion lender, docked the 2015 bonus of Mr. Thain, its departing chief executive, by 30 percent because he did not successfully integrate OneWest, the California bank CIT bought last year for $3.4 billion, into the company. Its a rare and welcome financial penalty for poor merger execution.Mr. Thain did not get the management teams and cultures to mesh quickly enough, CIT said in a filing on Thursday. The takeover received regulatory approval only toward the end of July but it was announced a year earlier, which should have given the chief executive plenty of time to get his ducks in a row.The knock contrasts with the treatment of executives at BB&T, another acquisitive bank. Its top five executives shared a $2.5 million bonus for consummating the $2.5 billion takeover of Susquehanna Bancshares last year and to incentivize a successful integration. Closing a deal is only the beginning. CITs approach, tying incentives to the actual achievement of the promised benefits of a merger, is the right one.CITs directors have not always kept such a careful eye on pay. They were less disciplined, for example, about Mr. Thains retirement pot: In December, the company changed the rules on its definition of retirement to allow him to keep more of the stock he has been awarded that is scheduled to vest after he leaves. That could much more than offset the dent in his bonus.Even so, it looks as though the parameters CITs board set for Mr. Thain gave it sensible ways to help match his pay with performance, both quantitative and qualitative. The perils of too much focus on quantitative measures are clear from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. The companys accounting mess has brought a share-price collapse and management turmoil. The company suggested on Monday that aggressive targets might have been a contributing factor to what it called improper revenue recognition.Even when a merger is sensible, making it work is a crucial part of the job for a companys leaders. Others could usefully follow CITs example and ensure that deal execution factors into top executives pay."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   Ten hours before terrorists struck Brussels, Donald J. Trump was on television describing his strategy for confronting the Islamic State: He would pound it with airstrikes, but any ground action must be taken by the United States partners in the region. He did not mention, if he knew, that this was a pretty close approximation of President Obamas approach.But then Mr. Trump went further, saying that the American contribution to NATO  whose headquarters is in Brussels, smack between the airport and the subway station bombed by the Islamic State on Tuesday  should be scaled back.It was a surprising signal to Europe at a moment when it is under attack, and a vivid reminder of the risks of running for president in an age of terrorism: What sounds reasonably cautious in the evening can ring weak or strategically incoherent by morning.Most presidential candidates, with rare exceptions, are tempted to adopt far more hawkish stances on the campaign trail than presidents do in the Oval Office, where they must confront the realities of building coalitions, sorting through conflicting intelligence and pursuing comprehensive counterterrorism programs. But in the current atmosphere, a strike like the one on Tuesday in Brussels rekindles every debate about whether the United States should use diplomacy, isolation or military might.Indeed, within hours of seeing images of the carnage in Belgium, Mr. Trump renewed his calls for a ban on Muslims entering the United States and for legalized torture to extract information from an Islamic State operative captured last week in Brussels. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas went beyond his promise of carpet-bombing to demand that the United States empower law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.Even Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who objected to Mr. Cruzs idea, called on Mr. Obama to abandon his trip to Cuba and Argentina, though it was not clear what more he could do from the White House than from the secure bubble in which he travels.Hillary Clinton, while positioned at the hawkish end of the Democratic race, sounded mild compared with the Republicans scrambling to say how they would interrogate Muslims or separate them from the rest of the population.A former secretary of state portraying herself as the steadiest, most experienced candidate to lead the United States and the world, Mrs. Clinton is promising continuity with the Obama administration. So she argued for doing more of what it is already doing: standing in solidarity with our European allies, tightening the visa and passenger-list systems, and making sure, along the way, to remember that torture is not effective.Mrs. Clinton was headed next to Silicon Valley, however, and she dropped some of the hard language she has used before in siding with the F.B.I. in the debate about cracking encryption on smartphones, falling back to finding a reasonable path forward for gaining access for investigators to encrypted conversations and text messages.Mrs. Clintons aides said she would give a speech Wednesday at Stanford University detailing her plans to defeat the Islamic State.Weve got to defeat them online, she said on Tuesday in Everett, Wash. That is where they radicalize, and thats where they propagandize.The responses reflect the different primary electorates the Republican and Democratic candidates face. Republican voters overwhelmingly support Mr. Trumps idea for a ban on Muslim immigrants, exit polls have showed.But opinion polls have shown that most Democrats do not, and they remain deeply admiring of Mr. Obama  whom Mrs. Clinton has been loath to show up by responding more swiftly to international events.Like Mr. Trump, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said his piece on Monday, giving the first detailed foreign policy speech of his campaign.But it was also notable for its generalities: He said that the United States has the opportunity, as the most powerful nation on earth, to play an extraordinary role in attempting to put together a coalition in the region to destroy ISIS.To Obama administration officials, this is not a new idea. They have been trying to accomplish exactly that, often with less success than they would like, for three years.The instant responses to the attacks in Brussels highlighted the tightrope that all of the candidates find themselves walking when the subject turns to combating terrorism. The bitter lessons of the Iraq war loom over the 2016 election, as they loomed over the previous three, and none of the remaining candidates are calling for a ground force to take on the Islamic State in Syria or Iraq.Mrs. Clinton often recalls that she argued, in Mr. Obamas first term, for far greater support for the rebel groups confronting President Bashar al-Assad of Syria  a way of indicating that she is somewhat more hawkish than her former boss, who rejected the advice. (Mrs. Clintons view was supported by David H. Petraeus, then the C.I.A. director.)But there is no way to prove whether, had Mrs. Clintons counsel been accepted, it would have affected the rise of the Islamic State in Syria, and Mr. Obama insists it would not have.Mr. Sanders has the opposite problem: He provides a compelling analysis of why the United States has had such difficulties dealing with the Islamic States rise, but few new ideas.The fractured nature of the civil war there has diluted the fight against ISIS, he said about Syria on Monday, exemplified by the Russian airstrikes that prioritized hitting anti-Assad fighters rather than ISIS.Taking back territory from the terrorist group, Mr. Sanders said, was useless without someone to govern it. But he would not say who that someone should be, only that the struggle must be led by the Muslim countries themselves on the ground  a rare area of agreement between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump.Some of the harshest messages and vaguest plans have come from Mr. Cruz. His carpet-bombing suggestion was immediately denounced because he appeared to be advocating a war crime; carpet-bombing is, by its nature, indiscriminate. So he now focuses on sealing the United States off from terrorist groups. Thus his call on Tuesday for patrols of Muslim neighborhoods, perhaps the ultimate step in ethnic profiling.Mr. Trumps willingness to share his opinions over decades in the public eye has left a paper trail of noticeable shifts in his positions: from speaking approvingly of intervention in Iraq early on, to opposing it, to his seemingly dueling impulses of aggressiveness and isolationism as the Republican front-runner.After the terrorist attacks last year in Paris and San Bernardino, he set off a storm of outrage by calling for a ban on Muslims entering the United States, and he repeated that call on Tuesday in television interviews after the Brussels bombings.He often promises to knock the hell out of ISIS, and in a debate on March 10, he answered a hypothetical question about whether he would heed the advice of generals, if they recommended deploying 20,000 to 30,000 ground troops to Syria, by saying, I would listen to the generals, but Im hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000.But on Monday, Mr. Trump suggested that he would reject any call to use ground troops, and appeared to suggest that he thought that American engagement could be effective even if it were limited to airstrikes  a view not held at the Pentagon.Id get people from that part of the world to put up the troops, and Id certainly give them air power and air support and some military support, Mr. Trump said on CNN. But I would never, ever put up 20,000 or 30,000.Yet such calls for a regional ground force have been rejected by most of Syrias neighbors, except Iran."}
{"text": "The furious fighting in the ranks of Republican opponents of Donald Trump  combat that is growing ever more heated and rhetorically violent  has forced open to public view long-festering wounds in the conservative coalition.Take, for example, the ongoing exchange between Bill Kristol, the publisher of the conservative Weekly Standard, and John Feehery, the director of government affairs for the lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie and Associates.It began when Feehery, speaking about Trump, told the Atlantics Molly Ball on March 16, if it werent for all the idiotic and racist comments, he would be kind of a breath of fresh air. Feehery continued:In the current issue of the Weekly Standard, Kristol, shot back in an essay called Donald and Decadence:The Republican establishment, including its cadre of lobbyists, Kristol continued, hasThese Trump accommodationists have brought to light the rot of an ideological movement that many of us had thought was alive and reasonably well.Feehery is not one to turn the other cheek. In a March 18 blog post, Feehery asked incredulously, Kristol Attacks Me?To clear the air, Feehery noted that he has not endorsed anyone but I really, really like John Kasich. Feehery said that his own basic policy in elections is to support whomever the Republican Party nominates.He then counterattacked: Our party is in the shape it is today because of people like Bill Kristol.Kristol, in Feeherys view, helped lay the groundwork for the Iraq invasion, a huge mistake. But most of all, KristolPalin, in turn, Feehery argues, was the real start of the dumbing down of the G.O.P., a cascading process that led to Trump. You dont get to Donald Trump without Sarah Palin.Everywhere you look, the intraparty split over Trump dominates strategic discussions.Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House who led the Republican take-over in 1994, sees Trump as the latest incarnation of the Reagan revolution:Not so, counters Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia. In a letter to his constituents just before the Virginia primary on March 1, Rigell wrote:Nowhere on the right is the conflict as hostile as it is among conservative Christians.Steve Berman, a self-described 100% conservative writing for the Resurgent, argues that in effect Trump is the current anti-Christ. If America is not on Gods side, then God will not bless America, Berman wrote.In direct contrast, Jerry Falwell Jr., president of Liberty University and a son of the founder of the Moral Majority, backed Trump on Jan. 26, declaring:Russell Moore, the president of the Southern Baptist Conventions Ethics and Public Policy Commission, is appalled by Falwells statement, and also by pro-Trump declarations from such prosperity-oriented evangelical leaders as Joel Osteen, pastor of Lakewood Church in Houston, the biggest church in the United States, and Robert Jeffress, pastor of the Dallas megachurch First Baptist.In a phone interview, Moore described Trump as the embodiment of cultural decadence  the personification of the moral decline he says Christian leaders have struggled to halt for the past generation.Some high profile evangelicals are completely repudiating the conviction that character matters, Moore said. He described Trump as aWherever he goes in religious circles, Moore said, Trump is the dominant subject of discussion: How do we maintain the witness of the Christian church at a time when America seems to have gone crazy?Despite the critique voiced by Moore and other conservative Christians, Trump won a plurality of the white evangelical primary vote, often by margins well into the double digits in such former confederate states as South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Florida and Mississippi.In every recess of the right, the struggle between those who would accede to the political verdict rendered in the primaries so far and those who would stand on principle against Trump is playing itself out. Two influential Republicans on opposing sides are Erick Erickson, the Georgia-based conservative commentator, and Ed Rogers, who served in the Reagan and Bush administrations and is now chairman of the Washington lobbying firm the BGR Group.In his regular Washington Post column, Rogers affirmed his commitment to bend to the will of the Republican primary electorate:Erickson is having none of that. In an essay called The Will of the People is Crap, he declared:Its hard to see how Trump, if he wins the nomination, could emerge from the Republican wreckage he leaves in his wake to actually win the general election  an assessment supported by the findings of a March 9 ABC/Washington Post poll. Not only did Hillary Clinton beat Trump 50-41 in the surveys match up among registered voters, but 67 percent of voters had a negative view of Trump, 15 points more than Clinton.While only 37 percent of those polled considered Clinton honest and trustworthy, even fewer, 27 percent, believe that those words accurately describe Trump. When voters were asked if Clinton and Trump have the experience and personality to serve as president, Clinton beat Trump by 66-26 and 58-26 respectively.It is universally acknowledged, however, that this is not a normal election. One of Trumps talents is the destruction and humiliation of his opponents, as the Republican candidates who have dropped out one after another can testify.Trump is already testing highly provocative lines of attack against Clinton, including a video he posted on social media that shows the former Secretary of State barking like a small dog as Vladimir Putin laughs in the background.But more than anything else it is the class divisions within the Republican electorate that have provided the basis for the Trump offensive. As my colleagues Patrick Healy and Jonathan Martin put it on Jan. 9:The phrase fast changing demographics is a reference to the growing numbers of blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and other minorities, while the white share of the population steadily declines.Damon Linker, writing for The Week, put another spin on the sources of Trumps success:In his appeal to the bottom of the top-down Republican coalition, Trump has defied elite Republican orthodoxy that minimizes government responsibility for social insurance and he has repudiated classic Republican demands for the reduction or privatization of Social Security and Medicare benefits. In 2013, he warned the Conservative Political Action Conference:Earlier in the campaign, Moore of the Southern Baptist Convention produced an apt description of the contestants in the Republican nomination fight. He told Roll Call:For those who do not recall, Jimmy Swaggart was a hugely popular southern televangelist until the Assemblies of God defrocked him for moral transgressions.Elsewhere, Moores dissection of the Trump phenomenon was even more trenchant:Moore went on. Voters shouldTrump has become a human wrecking ball. He may be able to assemble the 1,237 delegates needed to win his partys nomination, but when he is done with that he will face the task of building a national coalition strong enough to make the old one he has destroyed irrelevant.In the face of this possibility, should we ask ourselves  whatever our beliefs are  to live up to Moores ethical values? What happens if we dont?"}

{"text": "President Obama began his speech to the Cuban people on Tuesday with humility and grace. Cultivo una rosa blanca, he said, reciting the opening line of one of the most famous poems by Jos Mart, the islands national hero. I plant a white rose.It was an inspired way of extending an olive branch to a neighboring nation with which America has feuded for more than half a century. Mr. Obama made a compelling case that the ties that bind Cuba and the United States are more powerful than their differences.I have come here to bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas, Mr. Obama said Tuesday morning at the Grand Theater of Havana, drawing applause. He spoke movingly about the human toll the acrimony between the two governments has taken on Cuban exiles and those who remained on the island. He hailed Cubas rich culture and the tenacity and resourcefulness of its people.And he made it clear that the United States has neither the capacity nor the intention to impose change on Cuba. What changes come will depend upon the Cuban people, he said. We will not impose our political or economic system on you. We recognize that every country, every people must chart its own course and shape its own model.His message included a healthy dose of criticism and a call for change, which were delivered with both force and tact. He said President Ral Castro, who attended the speech, need not fear the different voices of the Cuban people  and their capacity to speak, and assemble, and vote for their leaders. He said sustainable prosperity in the 21st century requires the free and open exchange of ideas.Mr. Obama said that the United States was not beyond reproach, but that in a democracy, freedom to choose a nations leaders and freedom to speak without fear can lead to change. There is too much money in American politics, he acknowledged, and America still wrestles with the legacy of slavery and segregation. But the fact that we have open debates within Americas own democracy is what allows us to get better, he said.That openness was also on display on Monday as Mr. Obama took a few questions from journalists while standing next to Mr. Castro. In Mr. Obama, Cubans saw an articulate statesman who is months away from stepping down from office. In Mr. Castro, they saw a cantankerous autocrat who failed to string together a few coherent sentences when a journalist asked why his government continues to detain people for their political beliefs.Leading Cuban dissidents who met with Mr. Obama at the American Embassy after the speech described his visit as a transformational moment.It was the speech we and millions of Cubans yearned to hear, Jos Daniel Ferrer, the leader of Cubas largest dissident group, the Patriotic Union of Cuba, said in an email. It was a light in the dark."}
{"text": "Jack Masey, a designer for the United States Information Agency whose model American kitchen, part of an exhibition in Moscow in 1959, provided the stage for an argument about communism and capitalism between Nikita S. Khrushchev and Vice President Richard M. Nixon, one of the Cold Wars most memorable confrontations, died on March 13 in Manhattan. He was 91.His death was confirmed by his wife, Beverly Payeff-Masey.In his nearly 30 years with the agency, Mr. Masey (pronounced Macy), an architect by training, presented a kinetic picture of American art, science and industry and the daily life of ordinary American citizens to audiences around the world, many of them, during the Cold War years, deeply suspicious of American culture and foreign policy.He made a point of engaging top architects and designers, including R. Buckminster Fuller and Charles and Ray Eames, to come up with imaginative buildings and sets to showcase nontraditional exhibition materials.Convinced that arresting images had more persuasive power than high-minded lectures, he put the accent on entertainment.At the American International Exhibition in Moscow, for example, he included fashion shows, current art by the likes of Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning and, to show how ordinary Americans lived, appliances like washing machines, dryers and electric ranges, which exhaled the aroma of baking cakes made from Betty Crocker mixes.For Expo 67 in Montreal, he had Fuller design a 20-story geodesic dome with a transparent acrylic skin. Expanding on the theme Creative America, Mr. Masey filled it with achievements in space technology and the arts.The section on American film included clips and props like the chariot from the 1925 movie Ben Hur, dismaying critics who would have preferred a more serious, official picture, heavy on historic documents and portraits of the founding fathers. Its not a safe exhibit, true, Mr. Masey told The New York Times. Its an experiment. But I hope it reflects dynamism and creativity.Jack Masey was born on June 10, 1924, in Brooklyn, where he grew up in dire poverty in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood. His father, who had been gassed during World War I, worked only sporadically as a house painter. His mother picked up occasional jobs as a seamstress.Encouraged by a teacher, he won entry into the newly created High School of Music and Art, from which he graduated in 1942.During World War II, he served in Europe with the Armys Camouflage Engineers, alongside the future fashion designer Bill Blass and the future painter Ellsworth Kelly, as part of the Ghost Army, a special 1,100-man unit that used visual and sound effects to impersonate larger forces.Mr. Masey spent much of his time designing inflatable rubber tanks and jeeps. Three guys could blow up a Sherman tank in a half-hour, he told The Times in 1969. Two guys, a jeep in about 15 minutes.After being discharged as a corporal, he studied architecture and graphic design at Yale, where he earned a bachelor of fine arts degree in 1950.A year later, while he was working in Manhattan for the architect John Peter, he was recruited by the State Department to help design international exhibitions sponsored by the United States Information Agency.His first assignment, in New Delhi, on the peaceful uses of atomic energy, was a highly technical exhibition that included a full-scale mock-up of the graphite reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Tennessee.The next year, when State Department officials noted with alarm that Communist governments were building official pavilions at the Jeshyn International Fairgrounds in Kabul, Afghanistan, Mr. Masey was asked to deliver an American pavilion in 12 weeks.He turned to Fuller, who designed and engineered a geodesic dome in seven days. It was manufactured in 30 days in North Carolina, flown to Kabul and erected in two days with Afghan labor. The exhibition itself was, to put it mildly, eclectic.The only thing we could find at the 11th hour was stuff that the American government had been using in trade fairs in Asia, Mr. Masey told The Guardian of London in 2008. Talking chickens, talking cows, bouncing ball bearings.For his efforts, Mr. Masey was put in charge of exhibitions aimed at audiences behind the Iron Curtain. After designing two exhibitions for international fairs in West Berlin, he turned his attention to the Soviet Union, where, after his 1959 show, he organized exhibitions on plastics, transportation, medicine, technical books and graphic arts.The 1959 exhibition, designed by Fuller and George Nelson, was seen by more than three million Russians, despite a barrage of hostile government propaganda against the consumer culture and avant-garde art on display.The only good thing about it was that it would end, as far as they were concerned, Mr. Masey told The Wall Street Journal in 2009. He added, I think they were very relieved when it ended and the torture was over.Back in the United States, Nixon, poised to run for the presidency, gained stature as a tough anti-Communist in his set-to with Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union.As a pivotal moment in the Cold War, the exhibition has become a classic case study, its politics and aesthetics explored in Cold War Modern: Design 1945-1970 at the Victoria and Albert Museum in Londonin 2008 and Face-to-Face: The American National Exhibition in Moscow, 1959/2015 at the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art in 2015.After designing the American Pavilion at Expo 70 in Osaka, Japan, Mr. Masey, on loan from the State Department to the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission, designed the traveling exhibition The World of Franklin and Jefferson with the Eameses.In 1979, he left the State Department and, with the designers Ivan Chermayeff and Tom Geismar, founded Metaform Design International. The companys projects included exhibitions at the Ellis Island National Museum of Immigration and the Statue of Liberty in New York, the Harry S. Truman Library and Museum in Independence, Mo., the National D-Day Museum (now the National World War II Museum) in New Orleans and the Johnstown Flood Museum in Johnstown, Pa.Mr. Masey, who lived in Manhattan and leaves no immediate survivors other than his wife, was the author, with Conway Lloyd Morgan, of Cold War Confrontations: US Exhibitions and Their Role in the Cultural Cold War, published in 2008.An exhibition of his work, Make-Believe America: U.S. Cultural Exhibitions in the Cold War, is on view at the Museum of Design Atlanta."}
{"text": "A buying spree by a Chinese insurance company that has emerged seemingly overnight is flashing a warning sign.An alliance led by the Chinese company, the Anbang Insurance Group, has for the moment been outbid for Starwood Hotels & Resorts, the owner of the Sheraton and Westin brands, by Marriott International. But that Anbang is even in the running  and may yet win out  is an indication of deal-making gone awry.Typically in a takeover battle, a strategic bidder should always triumph over a financial bidder like a private equity firm or Anbang, which has teamed up with two investment firms.The reason is simple. A strategic buyer is an operating company and almost always can pay more for a target. The strategic buyer can expect to earn more from the target through cost savings. There would be no need for two general counsels, for example.A strategic buyer should also be able to reap operating efficiencies or other benefits from putting two assets together  what deal makers call synergies. Think of the Walt Disney Company buying Marvel Entertainment to put the Marvel characters in Disneys movies and theme parks. This sort of strategic rationale is what is driving Marriotts bid.The last time financial buyers regularly beat out strategic buyers was in the months before the financial crisis as the credit bubble drove a huge private equity feeding frenzy. In those days, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Company could acquire First Data for $29 billion, borrowing more than the company was worth the day before the deals announcement.Anbang also announced deals for the Waldorf Astoria in October 2014 for $1.95 billion, 717 Fifth Avenue in February 2015 for an estimated $500 million and Strategic Hotels & Resorts for $6.5 billion from Blackstone only two weeks ago. Blackstone bought the company for $500 million less only three months ago. Its a nice deal for Blackstone, but one wonders why Anbang would pay so much more only a few months later.So what gives with all the hotel acquisitions?Anbang, which was founded in 2004, appears to be trying to build itself into a financial conglomerate along the lines of Warren E. Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway. Like Berkshire, Anbang is using insurance reserves to buy assets in a variety of businesses such as banking and real estate. It also spent over $2 billion on insurers in Belgium and South Korea in 2015.And Anbang is funding this spree by selling high-yield investment products to Chinese citizens.If this type of company existed in the United States, there would be an outcry. It may be reasonable for an Internet company to appear out of nowhere and be a giant after 10 years, but an insurance company? And one that is buying noncore assets abundantly? Weve seen this story many times before, and it typically doesnt end well.But a huge hunger for growth doesnt quite explain Anbangs attempt to buy more than $20 billion worth of hotel properties in the space of a year or so. There are the political connections, of course. Anbangs deal-maker chairman, Wu Xiaohui, is said to enjoy warm relations with the Beijing government. His wife is the granddaughter of Deng Xiaoping, the former leader of China.The companys explanation is that it is diversifying. It appears to view global real estate as a high-yielding asset that will allow the company to diversify its assets out of China at a time when Chinas economy is slowing. This is particularly important for a life insurer, since Chinas population is aging rapidly, so higher returns are a must.It is easy to compare the shopping spree by Anbang and other Chinese companies to the shopping by Japanese companies in the 1980s. Back then, the emerging giants of Japan sought out trophy properties in the United States, including Rockefeller Center. The Japanese mostly bought at the top and then suffered through the downturn in the early 1990s. Given the price of commercial real estate these days, as well as the price Anbang paid for the Waldorf Astoria  a record for a hotel in New York  one has to think that this might be the case again.But acquiring Starwood is even a step further afield. In the case of the Waldorf, Anbang entered into a 100-year contract with Hilton to manage the property.But who would manage Starwood? Anbang has partnered with the private equity firm J. C. Flowers & Company and the Primavera Capital Group. J. C. Flowers specializes in acquisitions in the financial services industry. Primavera is a Chinese private equity firm. Neither appears to have much hotel experience.Given the state of the hotel industry  with Airbnb shaking up the world  it is hard to see where Anbang would get the necessary experience. One supposes the life insurer could keep on the Starwood team, but Anbang has already had trouble managing its new non-Chinese subsidiaries.In the case of Anbangs Belgian acquisition, the management team left after a few months amid complaints of Anbangs management style.None of this justifies outbidding Marriott, which has more experience and can reap more savings from Starwood.Instead, this is probably just a grand currency play. Anbang is willing to overpay because it is converting Chinese currency. As the world knows, there are expectations that there will be a further devaluation of the Chinese currency, the renminbi. By moving its money out of China, Anbang can hedge against such a downturn.Anbang also buys further protection from interference by Beijing authorities. So even though there is a slow-motion flight of dollars leaving China that Beijing is trying to halt, Anbang is probably trying to get more dollars out. After all, if there is a devaluation, this will benefit everyone in China, at least.Anbang may have now pushed too far on this front. Caixin, a Chinese business publication, has reported that insurance regulators in China are said to be preparing to block the bids for both Starwood and Strategic Hotels & Resorts, because they would violate rules prohibiting insurers from investing more than 15 percent of their assets abroad. Well see how these politics play out.Should Anbang persevere and come out the winner in the bidding for Starwood, there will certainly be talk about national security and the review process by the Council on Foreign Investment in the United States. This will be akin to the review over Smithfields when it was bought by Shuanghui International Holdings. There will be some hand-wringing about a Chinese buyer, but ultimately there will be no issues except perhaps some forced sales of hotels near strategic areas, like Starwoods hotel near the White House.But national security is not the real issue.The important question is this: If a 10-year-old opaque American financial conglomerate with no hotel experience were to buy Starwood, funding the transaction in part with the sale of high-yield investment products to retail investors, wouldnt that give us pause?Not only that, wouldnt we wonder about the future of Starwood?One answer is that we wouldnt. Starwood should be sold to the highest bidder, no matter the circumstance. But lost in all of this are the employees and operation of Starwood, and whether Anbang can even capably run this company. Shareholders, meanwhile, including its two largest shareholders that are activist funds, would probably just take the money.Perhaps the more prudent answer, one our current financial system doesnt address, is that there is too much risk here. The acquisition raises all sorts of issues about takeovers and the responsibility to look out for the company itself.It seems to be a conversation worth having."}
{"text": "The publisher and TriBeCa resident Judith Regan was in her reliable old neighborhood restaurant the Odeon the other day when she smelled something different in the air, and it certainly wasnt a new entree on the menu.Youre very hip again, Ms. Regan told the headwaiter.She was right. The joint is jumping. The bartender with her glasses and slash of red lipstick looks like a younger Jenna Lyons. Whos that by the window eating a nioise? Jonathan Burnham, the senior vice president and publisher of HarperCollins. And by the wall near the bar, having an omelet? Pamela McCarthy, the longtime deputy editor of The New Yorker. And that guy in the booth by the back? The clothing designer Steven Alan.They make a fantastic burger, Mr. Alan said.Mayor Bill de Blasio has been here recently, as has Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney. Not together, stressed Aimee Bell, the deputy editor of Vanity Fair and another regular.In recent years, the Odeon, mellowed in middle age, had been a favored setting for the sort of celebrity interviews Ms. Bell and her cohort assign, its dark corners and relative desertion offering privacy as well as pedigree. Now, thanks to the arrival of Cond Nast at nearby One World Trade Center and the subsequent influx of editors and executives, its probably too noisy to capture the musings of Jennifer Lawrence or Kanye West.Pilar Guzmn, editor in chief of Cond Nast Traveler, is another new regular; so are the dude-itors from GQ. And the Voguettes come, two by two as if to Noahs Ark: on a recent Monday Chioma Nnadi, the fashion news director of Vogue.com, and Chloe Malle, the magazines social editor and the daughter of Candice Bergen and Louis Malle. They were accompanied by Shala Monroque, a statuesque fashion world fixture and ex-girlfriend of the gallerist Larry Gagosian.Its the new Lambs Club, Ms. Nnadi said of the Odeon, which regulars refer to as the O.The only other place is the mall, said Ms. Malle, referring to Brookfield Place, a tribute to global capitalism that has become the commercial hub of ground zero.Ms. Malle, who likes to conclude her lunches by polishing off a dish of house-made ice cream, compared Brookfield Place to the Dubai airport. And Ive been to Dubai, she said.The Odeon arrived in TriBeCa in October 1980, opened by the British-born Brian McNally, his younger brother Keith McNally, and Keiths American girlfriend, Lynn Wagenknecht, with $150,000 in seed money from their families and a couple of close friends.Keith McNally had acquired a substantial customer Rolodex after working as a headwaiter at One Fifth, a restaurant near the north end of Washington Square Park that was decorated like the inside of a cruise ship and had become popular among artists, writers and the cast of Saturday Night Live, which had many of its post-show-parties there. (Brian had been the bartender there and Lynn had waited tables.)The three were taking a significant risk. Back then, getting south of the Holland Tunnel was for taxi drivers an endeavor somewhat akin to passing through the Bermuda Triangle. High-end furniture showrooms did not yet exist.Odeon, said the author Jay McInerney, who helped put it on the map and is now a wine columnist for Hearst, was: an oasis in the desert. There wasnt much down there. There was commercial industrial activity during the day, and at night they were very dark streets.Seated on a recent afternoon at a table by the wall, Brian McNally said, All of us thought it would last a week. Mr. McNally, a stout man of 67 whose streaks of gray and other markings of middle age do little to detract from his boyish demeanor, was surrounded by the deco furnishings that have ornamented the place since the days of Janice Dickinson and Bolivian marching powder.The McNallys and Ms. Wagenknecht, 62, who has a degree in art history from Stanford and spends much of her spare time painting, had both a voracious appetite for culture (Keith, 64, had briefly been an actor, starring in plays by Alan Bennett) and coolheaded business sense.We didnt do drugs, Ms. Wagenknecht said. We were actually sort of nave about them.The food was always good, mostly impervious to the loopy trends (verticality, foam, pig trotters) that overtook restaurant culture over the next two decades.During that time, Ms. Wagenknecht and Keith McNally would marry and then divorce, Brian would break off from Keith in a feud that lasted many years, and each brother would open other restaurants.But Odeon hung on, in part because of the influx of art galleries and the opening of nearby nightspots. People would repair there before and after the Mudd Club, before and after Area, the artist Ross Bleckner said.We would pull down the metal gate in front at 4 a.m. and people inside could stay until 6 a.m., Brian McNally said.The writer Dirk Wittenborn, who often accompanied his good friend John Belushi there, said, No place was open that late. (And it no longer is, closing down no later than midnight these days, reflecting the new lock step of affluent Manhattanites to the Google calendar.) Many longtime customers recall Mr. Belushi taking over the kitchen one night, although getting the particulars is about as likely as explaining the Cuban missile crisis.There were other actors as well, like Harvey Keitel, who went there with a date early on, using the occasion to try out a long-coveted belted leather trench coat like the ones he used to see in movies about World War II but was nervous to wear himself.I thought Nows the perfect time, because no ones around on the street, Mr. Keitel said. So I put on the trench coat, I go down to the Odeon, and theres a guy sitting there in a booth on the opposite side of the bar, and he looks at me and he says, Harv. Real slow. I peer down and its Jack Nicholson. And the next thing out of his mouth is Youre wearing a leather trench coat? That was the first and last time I ever wore it.Another evening that didnt end so well was a party celebrating the gallerist Mary Boones 30th birthday, with the sort of crowd that she described in New York glitterati shorthand as everybody.This meant a pile of big artists, among them David Salle, Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Sometime during the course of the evening, Mr. Schnabel and Mr. Basquiat went downstairs to the bathrooms and decided to do a little art project of their own, soaking all the toilet paper in the toilet bowls, after which they threw them up on the walls.Like snowballs, Ms. Boone said, describing perhaps the duos only creative efforts from that time not to be sold later on by her or Mr. Gagosian, another super-gallerist regular at the Odeon, for millions of dollars.Keith just threw us out, Ms. Boone said. We didnt get to have birthday cake.Over the next few years, the Odeons supremacy (a downtown Elaines, is how the publisher Morgan Entrekin put it) only seemed to increase. Keith Haring began coming in, as did Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe and Calvin Klein.But by the publication of Mr. McInerneys first novel, Bright Lights, Big City in 1984, which had a picture of the Odeon on the cover and scenes set there, the relationship between Brian and Keith was beginning to fray.Keith was the driving pulse of the place, Brian McNally said. I was, by definition, less responsible. (Keith said at first that he would prefer to answer questions about the Odeon over email. When asked for a little more than that, he said hed like not to be interviewed at all.)Brian left the operation and went on to start a number of restaurants, including 150 Wooster Street, the Canal Bar and, most successfully, Indochine. During the aughts, he moved to Saigon, Vietnam, where he still spends part of the year.Keith and Lynn began colonizing the rest of the city, heading first to the Upper West Side with their second successful update on the French bistro Caf Luxembourg (Odeon for the Central Park set). After that came Nells, a dinner spot and nightclub on West 14th Street that Ms. Wagenknecht ran until 2006. In 1989, the couple opened Lucky Strike on Grand Street.Following the couples divorce in the early 90s, Ms. Wagenknecht bought Keith out of Caf Luxembourg and the Odeon, both of which she operates today; Keith kept Lucky Strike. She deserved it, Brian said. Why not?After a brief detour in film direction, Keith began building his empire. Many of his restaurants have been remixes of the original concept: Balthazar (which one might think of Hard Rock Odeon) in SoHo, Pastis (Sex and the City Odeon) in the meatpacking district, Schillers Liquor Bar (hipster Odeon) on the Lower East Side and Minetta Tavern (hedge-fund Odeon) in Greenwich Village. There was also Pulinos on the Bowery, an upscale pizzeria recently refashioned as, you guessed it, yet another French bistro, Cherche Midi. (Bowery Odeon).Meanwhile, the original was changing in profound ways.AIDS killed many of the restaurants loyalists, as well as its employees. I cant tell you how many waiters died, Brian McNally said. Others overdosed (see Mr. Belushi 1982) or moved away, particularly as the city and the economy changed.Out went the artists. In rolled the bankers and their blond wives, their bodies honed at nearby Flywheel, followed by Bugaboo strollers. TriBeCa became what it is today, and I left, Mr. Bleckner said.And though the McNallys and Ms. Wagenknecht remained and even capitalized on the transformation of the city, they are smart and introspective enough to feel somewhat conflicted about it.Looking out a packed dining room, Ms. Wagenknecht offered that even now, when creative people have returned to the fold, she can barely identify anyone eating there. The expression on her face was actually a little sad, like a person who appears to have gotten over the death of a loved one decades ago and then finds the persons picture buried at the bottom of a desk drawer. Later this year, Keith is opening a new restaurant near ground zero in the coming Beekman Hotel and Ms. Wagenknecht is aware it will take some of her new customers away.But with Elaines gone and the idea of a convivial lunch in New York increasingly old-fashioned, the regulars at the revivified Odeon seem merely grateful its still here.They chalk up its success over the years  including as a local refuge after 9/11 and through two financial crises  to its excellent service (no one at Odeon seems to wait more than 15 to 20 minutes for anything, and thats on a bad day) and a broadly appealing menu that now includes a kale salad (In the 80s it was kiwi, Ms. Wagenknecht said of the ingredient du hour) along with ye olde reliable oysters and soft, perfect omelets.Speaking of the food at Elaines, Mr. Entrekin said, If you did a steak or a veal chop, you were O.K., adding, The food at Odeon is better.Ms. Regan is particularly partial to the frise with poached egg. The crowd waxes and wanes, but the truth is, it makes no difference, she said. Its like the boyfriend youre still friends with. The one you like even after you broke up with him.She praised the service, yes, but also the lighting.That amber lighting, which becomes more important to you as you get older, Ms. Regan said. Its home."}
{"text": "I dont mean to be a skunk in the March Madness garden party, but did you notice that just before the tournament began last week, the plaintiffs in OBannon v. N.C.A.A. petitioned the Supreme Court to hear the case? Earlier, the defendant N.C.A.A. had asked for  and received  an extension to file its own petition. (Its due April 14.) Although the Supreme Court agrees to hear only a small fraction of petitioned cases, OBannon is worth its attention.Its central question is whether the N.C.A.A.s amateurism rules  which currently restrict compensation for college athletes to a scholarship and a few thousand dollars to cover the full cost of attendance  are unreasonably and perhaps illegally restrictive. Its not a question fans like to think about as they wallow in the best sports event of the year, but it is one that only the court can ultimately resolve.The lead plaintiff is Ed OBannon, the former U.C.L.A. basketball star who, long after his playing days were over, saw his avatar in a college basketball video game and wondered why he wasnt being compensated for the right to his image. Though that narrow question led to the filing of his lawsuit, it evolved into a much broader class-action suit that put amateurism itself on trial. Were the N.C.A.A.s amateurism rules outlawing pay for athletes a necessary component of college sports, helping ensure competitive balance and providing the special sauce that persuaded fans to love it? Or were they an illegal restraint in a multibillion-dollar industry, a violation of the nations antitrust laws?After a three-week trial in June 2014, Claudia Wilken, the federal judge hearing the case, ruled that the N.C.A.A.s amateurism rules did indeed violate the antitrust laws. The OBannon plaintiffs were the official victors in the case.But it also turned out that she bought much of what the N.C.A.A. was selling. If, by limiting compensation to a college scholarship, the N.C.A.A. was violating the law, then the obvious solution would be to disallow those limits and leave the business of compensating athletes to the universities or conferences. Some might choose to pay their athletes, and some might not, but it would be their choice to make. Competition  which is why the antitrust laws exist  would be fostered.Instead, Wilken put her own limits on what athletes could reap from playing college sports. She said, for instance, that they should not be allowed to endorse products because it would undermine efforts to protect against the commercial exploitation of student-athletes. She allowed universities to add on the full cost of attendance, something that was already in motion. And though she ruled that the universities could set up a trust fund for athletes, she capped the fund at $5,000.In other words, while ruling that the N.C.A.A.s compensation limits violated the law, she was allowing the association to continue placing limits on athlete compensation  just slightly different ones.This was a huge win for the N.C.A.A. And it only got better when the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit weighed in more than a year later. In a 2-to-1 decision, the court agreed with Wilken that the N.C.A.A.s rules amounted to antitrust violations. But it actually took away the trust fund and limited compensation beyond the scholarship to the full cost of attendance. Why? Because, it said, cash compensation not related to education would damage amateurism. In other words, the N.C.A.A.s amateurism rules were illegal  but amateurism had to be preserved.Its easy enough to understand why both sides would want to appeal to the Supreme Court  but its just as easy to see the risks for each of them if the court agrees to hear the case. In practical terms, the N.C.A.A. won the OBannon case, since the appeals court has said that it doesnt have to allow compensation beyond what it is already permitting. But the fact that the N.C.A.A.s rules have now been officially labeled antitrust violations could someday come back to haunt it.There are other cases in the pipeline, including Jenkins v. N.C.A.A., which is being brought by Jeffrey Kessler, the lawyer who helped N.F.L. players win free agency. Kessler has made no secret of what he hopes to accomplish with the Jenkins suit: He wants to strip the N.C.A.A. of the right to set compensation limits for college athletes. The antitrust ruling by Wilken and the Ninth Circuit can only help him.In a statement, Donald Remy, the N.C.A.A.s general counsel, said, We continue to maintain that the N.C.A.A. operates well within antitrust laws, but we also agree with the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals recognition that benefits to student-athletes should be tethered to higher education.The worst outcome for Remy and the N.C.A.A. is if the Supreme Court views the OBannon case solely through the prism of antitrust  in which case they will most likely lose. When adults sue the N.C.A.A. on antitrust grounds  as a group of assistant coaches did in the mid-1990s, after the association passed a rule capping their pay  they often win. (After losing at trial, the N.C.A.A. paid $54.5 million to settle the case.) When college athletes sue, however, they have a much harder time winning, in large part because judges are often swayed by the N.C.A.A.s argument that because they are students, they shouldnt be paid.For the OBannon plaintiffs, an appeal brings the risk that the Supreme Court could overrule the Ninth Circuit and conclude that the N.C.A.A.s amateurism rules are legal after all. In 1988, in a case brought by Jerry Tarkanian, the mens basketball coach at Nevada-Las Vegas, the Supreme Court ruled that the N.C.A.A. did not have to provide due process when it accused someone of wrongdoing. From that moment onward, no athletes or coaches had any chance of winning a lawsuit based on the argument that they had been unfairly accused or unjustly punished. Should the court decide in favor of amateurism, the same would happen with compensation lawsuits. The Jenkins case would be dead in the water. No lawyer would be brave enough  or foolish enough  to bring new cases.(OBannons lawyers, led by Michael Hausfeld, would also lose the $48 million in legal fees they were awarded for winning the case.)Paying the players has become a public issue in a way that it never has before. Partly, this is because of the visibility the OBannon case has given to the issue. Partly its because advocates like Jay Bilas, the ESPN college basketball analyst, who has more than 1.1 million Twitter followers, are speaking out forcefully in favor of paying athletes. But its also because it is simply impossible to avert ones eyes to the billions of dollars pouring into college sports, virtually none of which go to the players.You can see it in just these first two rounds of the mens N.C.A.A. tournament. All weekend, ESPNs sports business reporter, Darren Rovell, tweeted out one money-related statistic after another. The Atlantic Coast Conferences success  it has six teams in the round of 16  will reap the conference $30 million. Nine of the teams still in the tournament are Nike programs; only two have contracts with Under Armour. A Duke season ticket costs $12,000 (including a mandatory donation). Wichita States coach, Gregg Marshall, whose base salary is $3 million, was due to get a bonus of nearly $100,000 had the Shockers beaten Miami. (They didnt.) Michigan States basketball team made $7.5 million last year. And on and on. The scent of money is inescapable.There is no secret where I stand on this issue: I believe the athletes should get some of that money. There are lots of people who disagree and think that a free education is more than enough compensation for playing college sports. The OBannon court decisions to this point simply havent provided a clear answer.In May, a month or so after the N.C.A.A. files its own appeal, its likely that the Supreme Court will decide whether to take the case. I hope that it does, and that it will provide, at long last, some clarity. As Hausfeld put it to me recently, We need to know."}
{"text": "BRUSSELS  Simon OConnor, a European Commission official, had parked his car and was about to walk toward the departure terminal, en route to Rome for work. Salom Corbo, an actress from Montreal, was at the Air Canada counter, about to check her luggage. Elouan Preaud and his wife, Angelina Centeno, were having breakfast, waiting to board an American Airlines flight to her native Colombia.Then came the blasts.The first one tore through the check-in area at Brussels Airport just before 8 a.m. on Tuesday. Another followed, seconds later, near a Starbucks.Mr. Preaud and his wife, who is pregnant, hit the ground as people screamed, Get down, get down! After the second explosion, he looked up to see a giant fan  part of an air-conditioning unit  that had landed near them. They had been eating at a Dlifrance, talking about Salah Abdeslam, the terrorism suspect who was arrested in Brussels on Friday after a four-month global manhunt.In 10 seconds, everything changed, Mr. Preaud said. It was an apocalypse. There was blood everywhere.Ms. Corbo, like other witnesses, said the second blast was stronger than the first.I felt myself pushed forward as if by a force of air, she said in a phone interview. People dove to the ground. Parts of the ceiling fell in. There were some injured people lying on the ground. I saw a foot that had been blown off.Mr. OConnor, the European Commission official, described hearing two deeply rumbling crashes as he approached the terminal from the parking lot.I saw the glass side of the terminal blown out, a lot of agitated people streaming out, he said in a phone interview. There were people with blood on their faces, people with injuries on the ground outside the terminal building. It was the kind of stuff you hope to never see.Nearly seven miles away, in the heart of Brussels  as paramedics, police officers and other emergency workers were still evacuating hundreds of passengers at the airport and taking scores of injured people away for treatment  a bomb went off on a subway train as it departed the crowded Maelbeek station. It was 9:11 a.m., just after the height of the morning rush.The train was coming into Maelbeek station, said Brian Carroll, 31, a communications consultant from Washington, who was on the train heading to a conference downtown. There was suddenly a loud explosion. There was smoke everywhere. Everyone dropped to the ground. People were screaming and crying. I was on the ground.My immediate reaction was, We are getting attacked by terrorists,  he continued. For all I knew, there was a gunman going from car to car and shooting people.After a couple of minutes, Mr. Carroll pried open a door of the subway car. I thought to myself, Ive got to get out of here,  he recalled. I headed toward an exit. There was smoke and soot everywhere. There was glass everywhere. It was like running through a cloud of dust.He eventually joined a friend near the Berlaymont, the headquarters of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union. Im a bit shaken up, but Im O.K., he said.Both the airport terminal and the subway station became scenes of carnage. Roughly 10 people were killed at the airport and 20 at the subway station, while 200 others were injured, officials said Tuesday evening, cautioning that the death toll could rise.Among the dozen or so witnesses interviewed on Tuesday, a theme recurred with striking consistency. None said they had thought an accident occurred. All of them said they had immediately thought of terror, specifically the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in and around Paris, which killed 130 people and were largely plotted in Brussels.We were scared that there were people with guns coming, said Johannie Hoedenaeken, a traveler who, like Mr. Preaud and Ms. Centeno, was eating at the Dlifrance when the airport explosions occurred. Thats what happened in Paris. I really thought I was going to die.Mr. Carroll, the visitor from Washington, said he had followed news coverage about Belgiums fractured governance and its response to the Paris attacks.This has been going on for a while, and the whole world is looking at Belgium, he said. All of us have doubts that the Belgian government can manage this situation. There are so many competing language groups. The police dont cooperate well together.But amid the chaos, there were acts of altruism.A kid came out bleeding a lot, said Ilaria Ruggiano, who was traveling with her mother and five others. I tried to help him with a tissue, but it was not enough.Ms. Corbo, the actress, credited a security guard for escorting her and other passengers to a secure area on the tarmac.There was a lot of humanity amid all the horror, she said. We received water. I was hungry, and a stranger offered me some nuts. People were helping each other.Even in their shock, people sought to alert or protect others.A lady was crying and yelling at me in French, said Murat Ueranuez, who was in the restaurant of the Sheraton Hotel across from the airport terminal, preparing for a conference of fraud examiners, when the blasts occurred. She was panicked. I said, I am sorry, I dont speak French. She switched to English and, speaking with a heavy accent, said: Dont go out, dont go out there. There are explosions. She was still crying and yelling and was obviously in shock.In the early evening, Belgian officials released a photo of three men captured from surveillance cameras, saying that two were suicide bombers and that they were looking for the third  who may have had a bomb that failed to go off. All three looked calm. Like many of their victims, they were pushing airport luggage carts."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   The Supreme Court weighed moral theology and parsed insurance terminology on Wednesday in an extended and animated argument that seemed to leave the justices sharply divided over what the government may do to require employers to provide free insurance coverage for contraception to female workers.A 4-to-4 tie appeared to be a real possibility, which would automatically affirm the four appeals court decisions under review.All four ruled that religious groups seeking to opt out of the requirement that they pay for the coverage must sign forms and provide information that would shift the cost to insurance companies and the government. A tie vote in the Supreme Court would not set a national precedent, and religious groups in different parts of the country would have conflicting obligations if they object to covering contraception.Other appeals courts have also agreed that the accommodation offered to religious groups is lawful. But the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, which hears cases from federal courts in Arkansas, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota, ruled that it violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993.Wednesdays case grew out of a regulation requiring many employers to provide the coverage for contraception under the Affordable Care Act. Religious institutions like schools and churches have said that forcing them to comply with that violates the religious freedom law. They also objected to an alternative offered by the government that would allow them to opt out of the requirement by completing a form.The courts four more liberal members appeared ready to endorse that alternative.There has to be an accommodation, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said. And thats what the government tried to do.But it appeared unlikely that the liberal justices would be able to attract the crucial vote of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who repeatedly questioned whether the accommodation was making the groups complicit in the moral wrong by hijacking their insurance plans.Though Justice Clarence Thomas asked no questions, there was little doubt where the three more conservative justices stood. Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., for instance, citing arguments in supporting briefs, said the governments approach represented an unprecedented threat to religious liberty in this country.Much of the argument concerned whether the government could provide free contraception coverage without using the groups insurance plans. Justice Alito suggested, for instance, that the government could use the insurance exchanges created under the Affordable Care Act.The burden on women would be minimal, Justice Alito said. So shell have two insurance cards instead of one, he said.But Justice Sonia Sotomayor said it was important to make obtaining coverage easy.When contraceptives are provided to women in a seamless way, she said, the number of unintended pregnancies dramatically falls, as does the number of abortions.Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., representing the Obama administration, said Justice Alitos alternatives would be cumbersome and would not come anywhere close to being equally effective in ensuring that women get this coverage.Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. seemed to view that answer as a major concession.Your compelling interest is not that women obtain the contraceptive services, the chief justice said. Your compelling interest is that women obtain the contraceptive services through the insurance plan or the third-party administrator hired by the religious groups.The petitioner has used the phrase hijacking, and it seems to me that thats an accurate description of what the government wants to do, Chief Justice Roberts said.But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said a cumbersome process involving two insurers would dissuade some women from obtaining contraception. He added that this is not hijacking because there is a federal regulation that says the infrastructure of the insurers contraceptive-related plan belongs to the insurer, not to the person who buys the insurance.Mr. Verrilli agreed, saying the alternatives would result in significantly less use of medically necessary services.The answer did not seem to satisfy Justice Kennedy. Thats why its necessary to hijack the plans, he said caustically.The church plans here, religious organization plans here, are, in effect, subsidizing the conduct that they deemed immoral, Justice Kennedy said.Paul D. Clement, a lawyer for the order of nuns the Little Sisters of the Poor and other challengers, said his clients should be entitled to the outright exemption offered to houses of worship like churches, temples and mosques. Houses of worship do not have to file any paperwork if they choose not to provide contraception coverage.He added that many other employers were also effectively exempt from the contraception requirement. Small employers need not offer health coverage, and some insurance plans that had not previously included contraception coverage are grandfathered, so long as they do not make substantial changes.Chief Justice Roberts said the argument had force: If you have a lot of exemptions, it undermines your argument that this is such a compelling interest.Mr. Verrilli said, No line is perfect, and Im sure this line isnt perfect. But he said the government had drawn sensible and commonplace distinctions.Justice Breyer questioned Noel Francisco, a lawyer for a second group of challengers, describing a federal program filled with haphazard exemptions and asking whether it would violate the religious freedom law.Mr. Francisco said sure.O.K., Justice Breyer said. Ive just described to you the United States tax code.On this point, at least, Justice Kennedy seemed to take the governments side. Its going to be very difficult for this court to write an opinion which says that once you have a church organization entitled to an exemption, you have to treat a religious university the same.All of the justices who addressed the issue agreed that the challengers religious objections were sincere. But the more liberal ones said a pluralistic society required compromise.Sometimes when a religious person whos not a hermit or a monk is a member of society, he does have to accept all kinds of things that are just terrible for him, Justice Breyer said. Think of the Quakers who object to Vietnam. Think of the people who object to laws protecting blasphemy. Think of the people who object to shoveling the snow in front of the walk that will lead to the abortion clinic.The more conservative justices were more apt to credit the challengers objections. Youre saying, Justice Kennedy told Mr. Verrilli, Dont worry, religions, youre not complicit.The case, Zubik v. Burwell, No. 14-1418, is the courts fourth encounter with President Obamas health care law. It builds on a case from 2014, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, which said that requiring family-owned corporations to pay for contraception coverage violated the religious freedom law. Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last month, was in the 5-to-4 majority in that case.The Little Sisters of the Poor, which operates nursing homes, objects to playing any role in providing any form of contraception approved for women by the Food and Drug Administration. Other challengers object only to covering intrauterine devices and so-called morning-after pills.The religious freedom law says that government requirements placing a substantial burden on religious practices are subject to an exceptionally demanding standard of judicial scrutiny.At the start of the argument, which lasted for more than 90 minutes rather than the usual hour, Justice Sotomayor asked how the case differed from prosecutions of conscientious objectors to war who refused to register with the government.Mr. Clement saved his most direct response for the end of the argument.My clients would love to be a conscientious objector, but the government insists that they be a conscientious collaborator, he said. There is no such thing."}
{"text": "The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation will give $4.8 million to the South Street Seaport Museum, which is recovering from severe damage incurred four years ago when Hurricane Sandy flooded streets around the seaport, according to state and museum officials. That damage came as the museum was just beginning to emerge from a decade of economic difficulties.The grant is part of a package of that Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced in recent days that will use $50 million from the development corps legal settlement with a construction company. The money will be used to finance 14 cultural, recreational and educational projects, including a new complex in TriBeCa for the Flea Theater, improvements to a Lower East Side community center run by University Settlement and the Chinatown Y.M.C.A., and several initiatives meant to increase public access to the Hudson and East River waterfronts.Jonathan Boulware, executive director of the seaport museum, said it would use the money to pay for improvements, including an elevator and new electrical, lighting, fire safety and security systems, to its five-story Thompson warehouse on Water Street and three adjoining storefronts that it owns. The grant will also go toward a new 11,000-square-foot educational community center on the warehouses upper floors.The L.M.D.C. funding is absolutely critical, Mr. Boulware said by telephone. The museum is vital to New York but has been hit very, very hard by 9-11, by the recession, by Sandy.The 2015 legal settlement stemmed from a lawsuit between the development corp and the construction company, Lend Lease Construction LMB, over costs connected to the demolition of the Deutsche Bank Tower, which was badly damaged in the attacks of September, 11, 2001. That project, which was plagued by delays, political disputes and a fire in 2007 that killed two firefighters, became one of the countrys most expensive and long-running demolitions.Earlier this month the South Street Seaport Museum opened its first exhibition since 2012. That show, Street of Ships: The Port and Its People, includes art and artifacts from the museums permanent collections related to the 19th-century history of the Port of New York, once the worlds busiest shipping hub."}

Tom Wolf of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, has backed off his latest threat to veto the budget after nine months of partisan gridlock that threatened to close schools and forced social-service agencies to lay off employees. Mr. Wolfs drive for a multibillion-dollar tax increase to fund a record increase in public school aid ultimately failed. A Republican-written, $6.6 billion no-new-taxes spending package will become law on Monday, though Mr. Wolf refused to sign it.

{"text": "Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights from New York Times staff members. In this article, David M. Herszenhorn, a congressional correspondent and former Moscow correspondent for The Times, whose wife and children live in Brussels, offers an on-the-ground perspective on security.I woke up on Tuesday morning in a hotel room in Madison, Wis., where I am on a reporting trip, to a flood of texts, emails and phone messages inquiring about the safety of my family in Brussels. I knew they were safe. My wife had tried to reach me  as I slept  to let me know that she and our three sons were O.K.Since December, when my family moved to Brussels so my wife could take a new job, the citys airport in Zaventem has become one of my favorite places. Arriving there, as I have at least a half-dozen times in recent weeks, means that I am minutes from seeing my boys, ages 13, 11 and 4. (My work is based in the United States, so I travel to see them as often as I can.)Typically, my wife picks me up and we head straight from the airport to the Saturday-morning outdoor market in Stockel, where we pick up brioche and cheese for breakfast and fresh vegetables for the weekend.Yet, much as I love arriving at Zaventem, there is no denying that security has been lax.In Moscow, where I worked as a correspondent for The Times for four years, it was impossible to enter any of the airport terminals without doing an initial baggage scan and going through a metal detector. That meant long lines often stretching outside in the bitter cold of Moscow winters. Once inside, this was followed by the customary security screening  relinquish all liquids, etc.  before entering the gate areas.Russia had learned the need for vigilance the hard way. In January 2011, eight months before I arrived to take up my assignment for The Times, a suicide bomber struck the international arrivals terminal at Domodedovo International Airport, killing 37 people. In 2004, two planes that had just departed from Domodedovo were brought down by Chechen suicide bombers.At Zaventem, there is no such screening (nor, by the way, is there such screening at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City or any number of other United States airports).Terrorist bombers placed suitcases filled with explosives onto luggage carts and wheeled them straight into the departure hall without anyone challenging them.That security at the Brussels airport has remained lax is particularly remarkable considering that the city was in virtual lockdown after the terrorist attacks in Paris in November. In the weeks following, Belgian soldiers were deployed throughout Brussels in a show of force and deterrence.Whenever my family would go to buy groceries at the Carrefour supermarket in Auderghem, a quiet neighborhood outside the city center, a military troop carrier would be stationed in the parking lot, with armed soldiers in fatigues posted at the entrances to the small shopping center. The show of force seemed more show than real security, with no added bag screening, or other checks, and soldiers incongruously smiling and greeting children.Such soldiers can be seen at the airport, but not in a way that suggested any sort of heightened security concern.Terrorism is a sad, ever-present threat. My family knows this well. And we were lucky this time.On another day, my wife or I could just as well have been on our way to catch a flight at the Zaventem airport  she heading on a business trip within Europe, or I heading back to the United States. Wed have been thinking more about the workday ahead or our kids than about the possibility of an Islamic State operative lurking nearby."}
{"text": "HONG KONG   There is a Vancouver Forest in Beijing, a Thames Town in Shanghai and an Oriental Yosemite in Dalian, China.Chinas suburbs have been filling up lately with housing developments whose names and architectural styles are meant to evoke the United States, Europe, Canada, Australia, anywhere but China. And the authorities dont like it.The minister of civil affairs, Li Liguo, said on Tuesday that bizarre names that damage sovereignty and national dignity or violate the socialist core values and conventional morality would be stamped out, the state news agency Xinhua reported.And it is not just foreignness he objects to. The report quoted Mr. Li as saying that excessively grandiose or strange names for roads, bridges, buildings and residential compounds would also face scrutiny.Housing developments have been the biggest generators of odd names. Beijing alone has a Chateau Regalia, a Rose and Ginkgo, Merlin Champagne Town, Le Leman Lake Villa, Beijing Riviera and International Wonderland.Developers say the international flavor helps sell houses. On the outskirts of Beijing, the Jackson Hole resort community, known in Chinese as Hometown America, attracts residents dreaming of a free and uncomplicated life.Tides of embrace or rejection of foreign arts, styles and philosophies have ebbed and flowed through Chinese history. In recent years, officials have tried to push back against Western values in textbooks and English-language acronyms in television and radio broadcasts.The concern over place names has been raised as part of an official Chinese geographical survey that began in 2014. Along with an explosion in foreign names, there has also been a noticeable disappearance of traditional names, Mr. Li said. The survey found that since 1986, 60,000 township names and 400,000 village names had fallen out of use as a result of development and urbanization, The Beijing News reported.It was not supposed to happen. There has been a regulation on the books in China since 1996 that prohibits the use of the names of foreign people or places for locations in China, including housing developments, The Beijing News said. But the rule has had little impact.Once a name is in use, though, changing it can be problematic. Officials tried to rename a street in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, ostensibly because the Chinese character used to represent its foreign name was often mispronounced by people unfamiliar with the place, China National Radio said. But residents objected and filed a lawsuit to block the change, citing the potential loss of historical identity.Previous efforts to change foreign place names in China have not been wholeheartedly embraced, either. In the southeastern city of Fuzhou, a housing development known as Fontainebleau was ordered by local officials to change its name, which became Gaojiayuan. Afterward, one resident complained to a local newspaper that she missed her bus stop after the signs were changed.And a real estate agent confessed that while the official name was now Gaojiayuan, for the purpose of selling houses it would always be called Fontainebleau."}
{"text": "The title of Jackie Sibblies Drurys stylishly contemplative new play, which opened on Wednesday night at the Abrons Arts Center, is unadorned by punctuation. But it comes with its own built-in question mark, or ellipsis, or both.Really it is called. And though really is a really overused word in everyday conversation, it automatically invites skepticism when seen by its naked self. Living with our shifting perceptions and even more variable memories, we can seldom say, with unconditional certainty, what really happened at a given moment, or even how we really felt.With the collaboration of the always intriguing experimental director (and dramatist) Richard Maxwell and his New York City Players, Ms. Drury has created a work that focuses on fixed images culled from lifes flux. Really is a play about photography. And it asks provocative questions about the value of what is seen in pictures that freeze fleeting moments for posterity.Ms. Drurys three-character drama may tackle issues commonly debated in aesthetic philosophy seminars, but its tone is never academic. Its language is prosaic, and its basic setup is one that has been recycled throughout modern domestic drama: The possessive mother of a young man who, it would appear, has died recently visits the woman he loved and lived with.As expected, the notion of which woman has the more truthful, complete memories of the absent man  who bore the uncompromising name of Calvin  is discussed with increasing sharpness. Such a battle of perspectives was particularly popular in the Freud-besotted plays of the first half of the 20th century. (Paging Eugene ONeill.)But it soon becomes clear that Really is interested in this familiar friction only as far as it serves the larger idea of photography as an art that misses as much as it captures. Ive said that this play is not academic, but it is highly cerebral, and any personal emotional resonance it may have for you is less likely to involve the relationship between these women than their relationship with Calvins art  and, by extension, yours, with pictures of yourself and people you know.Calvin (embodied here by Tavish Miller), it seems, was widely acknowledged as a first-rate photographer. The character identified only as Girlfriend, played by Kaneza Schaal (whose diffidence about her own extraordinary beauty works perfectly here), is also a photographer, though, by her description, not nearly on the same level.I think it might be difficult to actually take the photograph of what youre picturing, she says. The words are addressed to Calvins Mother (Elaine Davis), who has come to the clean, well-lighted loft that Girlfriend once shared with Calvin (and where she continues to live) to pose for a portrait.Clearly, the women have high and anxious expectations for this session, hoping they might discover something new and illuminating about each other and the man they both loved. It seems equally clear that such expectations will not be fulfilled.The production deftly uses the self-consciousness of its characters to create a more pervasive, self-examining consciousness about the artistic process that sets the rhythms for their dialogue. The production begins with Girlfriend slowly and methodically setting up lights, loading a camera, adjusting a lens.As Mother sits awkwardly in a chair, discussing mundane subjects with numbing velocity, Girlfriend remains silent, except for the occasional monosyllabic answer to a question, or a directive like the one she issues when she asks Mother to keep still.I mean you shouldnt be still, you can move, she says, but dont, like, move move, if thats okay. This contradictory instruction hints at more complex paradoxes to come.Calvin shows up as a full-bodied, present-tense memory. We see him as the willful, difficult, overachieving boy that Mother recalls, and as the hypnotically confident  and maddeningly patronizing  lover of the Girlfriend, whose beauty seems to expand in his vision of her, even as she shrinks in her own estimation.Really turns out to be, among other things, about the selfish  and, in this case, sexist  mono-focus of the artist. Here is Girlfriends assessment of her boyfriends perspective on people: I dont think that Calvin thought about you or about anyone, like thinking about what they did or didnt do. I think he thought about what he did and saw what people do but didnt think about it.Girlfriend, on the other hand, cant stop thinking about not only the motivations of those around her but also the larger world of short, brutal lives on which art makes little impact. The reductionism of photography troubles her. Still, theres no ignoring the transcendence of a great photograph or the value of finding form for thoughts (a subject that Mother touches on obliquely and affectingly).Designed by Michael Schmelling (set and lighting), who is also a photographer, and David Zuckerman (sound), Really takes place in a stark, simple box of a set. The performances are pitched at the level of heightened neutrality that is the signature of Mr. Maxwell (who titled one of his own plays Neutral Hero). Words are spoken calmly and with minimal inflection, as if an excess of shading might block the view of what is really (that word again!) being said.As is often the case with Maxwell productions, Really induces in its audience an intense sobriety that begets dizziness. As we watch Girlfriend arrange lights, pose her subject, click the shutter, photography seems a dry and technical business.But every so often we hear  and feel  a sonic thrum that suggests something ineffable emerging from this mechanical process. And then, in one ravishingly realized moment, we seem to enter the camera itself and exist in a world between fluid life and stationary image.Magic has happened, and its as unsettling as it is irrefutable. Does any photograph do justice to the reality it tries to capture? I think that Girlfriend would say no (and be right).And yet, and yet. The focused mind reels. Really is unusually clearsighted about the ambiguities of its subject."}

{"text": "Malik Taylor, the wry and agile rapper known as Phife Dawg, who as a member of A Tribe Called Quest brought left-of-center hip-hop to the masses, died on Tuesday at his home in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was 45.Mr. Taylors family and his manager, Dion Liverpool, confirmed the death and said the cause was complications of diabetes.Mr. Taylor learned he had diabetes in 1990  When was the last time you heard a funky diabetic? he once rapped  and received a kidney transplant in 2008. His health problems and self-proclaimed sugar addiction were a point of tension in the 2011 documentary Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of A Tribe Called Quest, which followed the group during a reunion tour.A Tribe Called Quest formed in New York in 1985, when Mr. Taylor was 15 years old, and went on to release five albums, including the jazz-sampling rap classics The Low End Theory and Midnight Marauders.With hits like Scenario, Can I Kick It? and Bonita Applebum, the group sold millions of albums while also serving as a more socially conscious and overtly political alternative to the gangster rap and pop rhymers of the day.The group disbanded for the first time in 1998.On recordings, the proudly diminutive Phife Dawg played a more frenetic and high-pitched counterpart to his childhood friend Q-Tip (born Jonathan Davis), A Tribe Called Quests lead M.C. The group also included the D.J. and producer Ali Shaheed Muhammad and occasionally the rapper Jarobi White.Phife Dawg and Q-Tips repartee was the most obvious manifestation of Tribes magnetic, brotherly bond, a chemistry that was almost palpable on record. You on point, Phife? Q-Tip volleyed to his fellow M.C. on Check the Rhime.All the time, Tip, Phife Dawg replied.We bounce off of each other like yin and yang, nice and smooth, you know? Mr. Taylor said of the partnership in an interview last year, as A Tribe Called Quest marked the 25th anniversary of its debut album, Peoples Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm.Mr. Taylor added that he never expected the group to be so successful: I just thought we were going to be celebs in the hood.Malik Isaac Taylor was born in Queens on Nov. 20, 1970, and throughout his career referred frequently to his home base, Linden Boulevard and 192nd Street.After meeting as children in church and playing Little League baseball together, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Davis began experimenting with music as protgs of the local Native Tongues Posse, which also included the group De La Soul. A Tribe Called Quest went on to sign with Jive Records on the strength of its 1989 demo tape.In a recent post on Reddit, Mr. Taylor said of making music: We were happy to be doing something to keep ourselves out of trouble. Eventually we were able to take care of our families. We were happy.After a decade together, A Tribe Called Quest split up after the release of its fifth album, The Love Movement. In a review of its last concert together, Ben Ratliff wrote in The New York Times that the group had produced music that a fan could grow up with a bit rather than discarding after adolescence.Phife Dawg released his only solo album, Ventilation: Da LP, in 2000. Before his death he had announced plans for further releases, even teasing online a new single, Nutshell, produced by J Dilla.A Tribe Called Quest reunited multiple times, including at the Rock the Bells festival in 2004, 2008 and 2010 and more recently in 2013, as an opening act for two New York shows on Kanye Wests Yeezus tour. Q-Tip called those the groups final concerts.The documentary Beats, Rhymes & Life, directed by the actor Michael Rapaport, chronicled the constant tensions over control and leadership among A Tribe Called Quests members.I think it is ludicrous that we are not performing together, Mr. Taylor told Rolling Stone last year. Were doing the fans a great injustice by not getting together and rocking.A Tribe Called Quest performed once more together as a quartet, reuniting on The Tonight Show in November for a vibrant rendition of Can I Kick It? Phife Dawg, in his hometown Mets gear, referred to the politics of the day in invoking the name of David Dinkins, the former mayor of New York: Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?/Youll be doing us a really big favor.His family said of Mr. Taylor in a statement, His love for music and sports was only surpassed by his love of God and family. Information on survivors was not available.At a concert in Australia on Wednesday, Kendrick Lamar led the crowd in a chant of Phife! Dawg! and thanked the rapper for allowing me to do what Im doing on this stage.The rapper Chuck D of Public Enemy responded to Mr. Taylors death on Twitter, calling Phife Dawg a word warrior, simple as that. Breathed it & lined rhyme into sport. A true fire social narrator.Questlove of the Roots, in a tribute on Instagram, said that Mr. Taylor was an inspiration from the moment he heard the track Scenario, in which Phife Dawg raps, Im all that and then some/short, dark and handsome.THAT was the moment I knew I wanted to make THIS type of music when I grew up, Questlove wrote.More tributes poured into social media as the news of the death spread. The hip-hop veteran Russell Simmons called him one of the greatest to bless the mic, while Mark Ronson said he made some of the most beloved hip-hop ever."}

My parents spend a lot of time traveling, so theyre nice enough to let my girlfriend and I stay as glorified house sitters, said Matt FX, whose full name is Matt FX Feldman (and who is no longer with his girlfriend). I see Westbeth as one of the last bastions of the Village that Bob Dylan sang about.Claim to Fame Matt FX is a prodigal music supervisor for Comedy Centrals Broad City and Hulus Difficult People. He also supervised the music for MTVs remake of the British controversial teenage drama Skins in 2011.Big Break After a childhood steeped in classical music and choral performance, Matt FX enrolled in LaGuardia High School. There, a friend, the future rapper Azealia Banks, inculcated him into the world of pop music. She played me the indie bands of the time, A Tribe Called Quest and Nelly, Matt FX said. She caught me up. He began as a D.J. with the party collective Tribes NY. Around the same time, a friend introduced him to the Skins creator, Bryan Elsley, who hired him to select music for the show.Latest Project Matt FX is cutting the music for the third season of Broad City on Comedy Central. He said of working with the shows creators and stars, Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson: Its a dream. Our tastes are a Venn diagram, and that middle circle is really, really big. He also released an EP in September called Scooter Island with his collective of the same name.Next Thing He is working on a full-length album and is supervising the music for the indie thriller film Urge, which stars Pierce Brosnan and Danny Masterson. It was fun to use scary, terrifying electronic music for the first time, he said.Need for Speed Scooter Island is named after Gulangyu Island in China, which Matt FX visited as a child. The island banned cars and bicycles. I brought my Razor scooters from New York, he said. They werent widely available in China yet, so the island hadnt had a chance to ban them.

{"text": "M. Crow & Company, a new boutique at 16 Howard Street in SoHo, is filled with lust-worthy, whimsical wares you probably never knew you needed.A marshmallow roasting stick made of oil-rubbed walnut, copper and leather ($60). A childs leather tool belt with a toy hammer made of cherry and Osage wood ($250). A pickle jar handcrafted from local clay and glazed with wood-stove ashes ($260). A pot of hair product made with homemade beeswax and hand-expelled oils ($120).The stores interior was just as laborious to build. By the entrance, the floor is a mosaic of hand-painted white-and-blue ceramic disks; deeper inside, the floor is maple marquetry recalling the layered feathers of a bird.Taken together, the shop evokes the edited yet wide-ranging output of an obsessive, eccentric master craftsman whos dedicated to hyperlocal production. And thats precisely what it is.M. Crow is the latest endeavor of Tyler Hays, who is better known as the owner and designer of the upscale furniture company BDDW, known for exquisitely handcrafted pieces that cost upward of $100,000. The 1,500-square-foot store may be just months old, but it is actually the second location. The first opened 108 years ago.The original M. Crow is a general store in the tiny town of Lostine (estimated population: 209) in northeastern Oregon; it is down the road from Mr. Hayss hometown, Joseph, Ore., at the base of the Wallowa Mountains. When the store was set to close in 2012, Mr. Hays bought it and remade it in his own vision.Its the oldest operating store in Wallowa County, said Mr. Hays, 47, a hearty man with the scruff and broad fingers of a woodsman and the warmth and storytelling ability of a cool uncle. I couldnt watch it fall apart knowing that my great-great-grandparents were watching, when I could do something about it.Today, M. Crow in Lostine still serves as a general store, albeit one that also sells local produce and beef, hardware, beer brewed in the back room and ceramics made with clay dug a few miles down the road. It also carries discounted items from Mr. Hayss line of meticulously produced accessories.But the larger vision for the brand is to extend the loving craftsmanship that BDDW is known for to products that address every aspect of daily life. Indeed, Mr. Hays said it stems from a childhood dream to personally make every object in his life from scratch.Im a junkie for making everything myself, he said. Im not interested unless I can control the entire process. I learned to use a sewing machine that my grandma gave me when I was 5. When I was 9, I welded a go-kart. My brother and I rebuilt engines, and made cannons and guns. He also built primitive furniture in his parents yard with a circular saw.Hes got a fearless approach to all materials, from food to furniture to clothing, said Tom Sachs, an artist who is a longtime friend of Mr. Hays. Tyler is an artist who happens to specialize in furniture. He takes that artist approach to whatever he does.Since founding BDDW in the late 1990s, Mr. Hays has been thrilling design purists with gorgeously handcrafted, minimalist furniture like dining tables with weighty live-edge claro walnut slab tops and cast bronze legs, and credenzas constructed from contrasting hardwoods perched atop blackened steel bases.He opened his first showroom at the entrance to Freeman Alley on the Lower East Side in 1998, long before every Brooklyn furniture designer with a table saw claimed to do the same. I said I was going to put the cool back in craft, Mr. Hays said at the time.BDDW relocated to its current 6,000-square-foot showroom on Crosby Street in SoHo in 2001, and developed a cult following.With business booming, Mr. Hays now runs a 150,000-square-foot production facility in Philadelphia with about 100 employees. But rather than focusing on maximizing his companys bottom line, he views the operation as infrastructure for exploring his every creative whim.In addition to furniture, his workshop now produces ceramics (using clay dug in Philadelphia and Lostine), clothing (sewn from fabric he machine-weaves and hand-dyes, with buttons he carves by hand), knives (crafted from repurposed band-saw blades), leather boxes (lined with sheepskin), stereo speakers (constructed from select woods) and pretty much anything else Mr. Hays can dream up, including bows and arrows for his archery club.And yet, hes just getting started. For now, most M. Crow products are made in Philadelphia, even though many of them use raw materials from Oregon. Mr. Hays said he plans to build a workshop in Lostine that will take over much of M. Crows production while creating jobs for area residents.But he will begin by building what just may be Oregons most extravagant microbrewery.A guy I grew up with is a barley farmer, and his grandpa invented a strain of barley thats gone out of favor, Mr. Hays said. Were planting 15 acres this spring, and Im developing this brewery in the field.The M. Crow brewery will produce not only its own beer, but also its own sculptural ceramic bottles from local clay. Im building a wood-fired kiln, and the waste heat of the kiln will power the brewery, he said.Like many BDDW and M. Crow products, all that labor and care will probably result in hefty price tags. M. Crow already sells ceramic growlers containing its beer and cider for $600 a jug. Its like an art object, Mr. Hays added, and probably not the kind of thing you would crack open to relax after a long day.The beer and the vessels are just parts of his larger vision for a complete lifestyle of his own making. Most of the products are things I want for myself, he said. Its all based on the idea of making everything I touch."}
{"text": "Enrichetta Ravina thought the professor was her mentor, helping her get access to an invaluable trove of data for her research into how workers allocate their retirement savings. It was scholarship, she believed, that could help her earn tenure at Columbia Business School.But then, she said, the comments started. The professor told her about watching pornography and his sexual exploits, she said. He started making advances toward her, calling her sexy. And, she said, he had the ability to have that crucial data set taken away.In a lawsuit against the university filed on Tuesday in Federal District Court, Ms. Ravina said she complained repeatedly to Columbia officials about the situation, but that they only dismissed and belittled her. The suit claims Ms. Ravina was subjected to gender discrimination and sexual harassment, and asks for more than $20 million in damages. She also wants more time to apply for tenure.I never really wanted to be in this position, but this was the only thing I could do, Ms. Ravina, 40, an assistant professor of finance and economics at the business school since 2008, said in an interview on Tuesday. I felt really betrayed. I thought the university should have solved this.Beginning in May 2014, Ms. Ravina brought her complaints to senior faculty members and administrators at the business school, the lawsuit says. One dean, the lawsuit says, called her circumstances a soap opera. Others told her to forget her complaints and to walk away from her research project. In November 2014, the lawsuit says, the office that ensures the university is in compliance with Title IX, which prohibits gender discrimination in educational institutions, found no violation.University officials told Ms. Ravina in June that she would be put on paid academic leave for the 2015-16 academic year, a period during which no action was expected to be taken regarding her tenure, the lawsuit says. By September, it claims, the leave was revoked, and in December she was told her tenure process would begin and run on an accelerated basis, the lawsuit says. With less time to prepare, Ms. Ravina feels she has little chance of getting tenure.The university declined to discuss Ms. Ravinas case because of the pending litigation, but said in a statement on Wednesday that the university treats allegations of harassment with the utmost seriousness.As part of her research, Ms. Ravina examines data sets to track the personal finance decisions of individual households.In the 2009-10 academic year, the lawsuit says, Geert Bekaert, a professor of finance and economics at Columbia since 2000, told Ms. Ravina that he could help her get access to a large set of data because of a relationship he had with the company that owned it. In the contract with the datas owner, Ms. Ravina said, the company had the right to revoke access, and Mr. Bekaert could influence it to do so.Ms. Ravina spent more than two years preparing the data for her research. Once she reached the point where taking the data away would have derailed her project, the lawsuit says, the harassment by Mr. Bekaert began.She claims that he retaliated against her when she rebuffed his advances by delaying and impeding her work. At one point, the lawsuit says, he told her that if she were nicer to him, he would allow her work to proceed faster.Ms. Ravina has filed a separate lawsuit against the professor.On Wednesday, Mr. Bekaert denied the allegations, and argued that the claims had been investigated by the university and found to be baseless.I am sickened that a colleague  I was never Prof. Ravinas supervisor or superior  would manufacture false stories, statements and events and attempt to destroy my reputation, Mr. Bekaert said in an emailed statement.In reality, he added, this is a sad example of no good deed goes unpunished: We collaborated for years doing research with a unique data set I had obtained from a company I worked for, and in return she fabricated a series of completely false allegations about me, some today for the first time.Ms. Ravina said the ordeal has been damaging to her professional reputation but also to her well-being. The lawsuit says her emotional distress is so severe that, for the past two years, she has seen a psychiatrist weekly to cope with her symptoms. The psychiatrist said she had a general anxiety disorder.I think my story is awful, but my sense is that many women go through this, Ms. Ravina said. The school has failed me, and it might have failed other people as well."}
{"text": "UBUD, Bali  It was his friends sixth sense that led the Indonesian architect Hendra Hadiprana to settle on the site that has become his Balinese home. Mr. Hadiprana had given over his expansive family rice farm in nearby Ubud, the islands cultural hub, to create the Chedi hotel. Now he wanted to find a suitable place to build a replacement getaway for himself.He happened upon a plot of unkempt land about 20 minutes drive from Ubud. Local residents were scared of the site at the time. The Petanu River runs along one edge of the property, carving out a narrow gorge thick with trees. But Mr. Hadiprana saw potential.The friend said he had a vision of two angels who told him that they had lived and played in that spot for 1,000 years. They would consent if Mr. Hadiprana wanted to build a house there, but they didnt want to be evicted.He would have to create a home for them as well.A dual, well-tended shrine in front of an ancient banyan tree on the property was created as a result. The homes dominant decorative theme is of twinned females. This is how Bumi Duadari, or the Land of Two Angels, got its name.The Petanu is like the Rhine  there are a lot of legends, Mr. Hadiprana said. If you live in Bali, you must respect them, right?Mr. Hadiprana shaped the rest of the site into tiers that echo Balis rice paddies. Then Mr. Hadiprana, who is ethnically Chinese and originally was called Hoo Tjoe Heng, built a home for himself and his wife, as well as a bungalow with three bedrooms for the families of his three adult children.Between them is the bale barong, an open-sided building that the family uses for entertaining  it can seat 24 for dinner. The entire grounds span 3,000 square meters, or about 32,000 square feet, a third of which is built on. Its location in the Petanu vale provides an escape from the equatorial sun.Its never, never hot, Mr. Hadiprana said. An avid collector, he likes to invite local artists to use the property as a studio. The wind comes through and back again. You can sit there the whole day.Members of the Hadiprana clan, who live and work in Jakarta, spent every significant holiday here until the patriarch, now 86, found it too stressful to make the trip from the Indonesian capital regularly. His monthly trips have devolved into irregular visits, and his daughter Puri looks after the home.In a travel-magazine clich, Bali is the Island of the Gods. Its Hindu inhabitants do spend an inordinate amount of time in ceremonies  you are sure to run into one if you drive around the island for any length of time. Small canang sari  daily offerings of banana-leaf boxes containing orange, red, blue and white flowers on a bed of rice  crop up in front of small shrines, homes and roadside shops.Bumi Duadari has its own share of offerings: birdbath ponds filled with the same splash of flowers. Mr. Hadiprana is Catholic and his private quarters at Duadari are filled with religious iconography, a statue of the Virgin Mary here, a painting of Jesus on the cross there. On the grounds, however, is a life-size white guru, seated with hands clasped in prayer. Stone statues of two female angels, 10 feet tall, face each other, also praying. Under the eaves, pairs of foot-tall female angels stand side by side, a motif repeated again and again across the width of the buildings.The dominant decorative pattern of the furnishings is the black-and-white checkered fabric that in Bali represents rwa bhineda, the duality of good and evil, life and death, yin and yang. Black and white fantail doves flit in and out of dovecotes dotting the property. Near the home of Mr. Hadipranas children is an oval lake where black swans swim in front of an island that is home to white ducks.The pitched roofs of the buildings are topped with traditional clay tiles from a nearby village. The basic structures are whitewashed brick, sometimes supported by pillars of unfinished concrete, which stand up to the tropical weather. But columns made from the trunks of aged coconut trees lend warmth to the verandas, as does the dark-chocolate teak of the roof beams, balconies and window frames. The teak carries through to the interiors, where the undersides of the roofs are an update on traditional alang-alang thatch. They are formed of straw-colored reed-thin strips of bamboo from the village of Kayuambe in northern Bali, known as the best on the island for this purpose.In one corner of the estate is a 30-foot pillar made from paras, a gray stone from the river. Atop this sits the family shrine and a small gold-plate statue of the ultimate god. As tradition dictates, it is in the kaja-kangin corner of the site: the northeast, which is the most auspicious. Although Mr. Hadipranas two-story private quarters are on a slope in the other corner, he made sure that the column topped the height of his home.The whole property faces the Petanu River, hidden in its 60-foot chasm. The Balinese now collect the water of the springs that feed the Petanu for ceremonies. But its formation dates to the legend of the evil king Mayadenawa, who forbade prayer to the gods. This caused Bhatara Indra, the god of war, to raise an army and attack him, finally killing him with a magical arrow.The wicked kings voice is said to echo down the Petanu, which means still voice. Legend has it that its waters course with his blood and make rice fields irrigated with water from the Petanu run red when harvested.Mr. Hadiprana said he could not remember the exact original price of the property. Construction of the buildings cost about 5 billion rupiah, or $372,000. Locals estimate the land is now worth close to $900,000. Neither the property nor the buildings are for sale.To him, the price of the property is immaterial. It has its own feeling, Mr. Hadiprana said of Bumi Duadari. The air is different already. The people are different. The Balinese are different people."}
{"text": "PARIS  Frances interior minister announced on Thursday that a French citizen had been arrested on suspicion that he was involved in a terrorist plot in the advanced stages of planning.Bernard Cazeneuve, the minister, said on Thursday evening that Frances domestic intelligence services were raiding an apartment building in Argenteuil, a northern suburb of Paris, after that arrest.At this stage, there is no tangible evidence linking this project to the attacks in Paris and in Brussels, Mr. Cazeneuve said, referring to the attacks that killed 130 in the Paris area in November, and the ones in the Brussels area on Tuesday that left at least 31 dead and 300 wounded.Mr. Cazeneuve said that the apartment building in Argenteuil had been evacuated and that a bomb squad was going through the building to ensure optimal conditions for police operations.Local residents and witnesses told French television stations that the surrounding area had been blocked off.This operation followed an important arrest carried out this morning by the General Directorate for Internal Security, Mr. Cazeneuve said, referring to Frances domestic surveillance agency, adding that the arrest had made it possible to thwart an attack plot in France that was in advanced stages of planning.Mr. Cazeneuve, who was speaking from the Interior Ministry in Paris, said the person arrested was suspected of being involved at a high level in the plot and was part of a terrorist network that planned to carry out attacks in France. The minister did not address whether the suspect had any Islamic State connection.He did not identify the individual or provide further details.France has been under a state of emergency since the Nov. 13 attacks, which were carried out in Paris and its northern suburb of St-Denis by coordinated teams of suicide bombers and gunmen. The suicide bombers who targeted the Brussels airport and subway appear to have been part of the same network.Mr. Cazeneuve said that 75 people linked to terrorist activities had been arrested this year. Of those, 37 were placed under formal investigation and preliminarily charged, and 28 had been detained, Mr. Cazeneuve said.After the attacks in Brussels, the French government announced that 1,600 additional police officers were being deployed to guard border crossings and transportation hubs across France."}

{"text": "BEIJING  A lawyer who was detained in southeastern China while defending churches that were being forced to remove their crosses has been released by the police, according to a post on his main Chinese social network account.The lawyer, Zhang Kai, was detained in late August and made a televised confession last month, apparently under coercion.The brief message posted to Mr. Zhangs account on the WeChat social network late Wednesday said that he was back home. I have returned to my home in Inner Mongolia safely, it said. Thank you to all my friends for your concern, caring and giving consolation to my family during this time. And thanks to the Wenzhou police, who have taken care of me during this time.Officials had announced criminal charges against Mr. Zhang earlier, and it was unclear whether he had been released on bail pending a trial. He and his family members could not be reached for comment, but China Aid, a Christian rights group based in the United States, said that it had confirmed his release with his relatives.Mr. Zhang was detained Aug. 25 in Wenzhou, a commercial city in Zhejiang Province with a strong Christian influence where officials have been waging a campaign to make churches remove their crosses. That push has been going on for two years across Zhejiang, where President Xi Jinping was once the Communist Party chief. More than 1,200 crosses have been removed from churches and other buildings.The authorities have also detained religious leaders and pressed criminal charges against them. Last month, a pastor, Bao Guohua, and his wife, Xing Wenxiang, were sentenced to 14 years in prison and 12 years in prison after they were convicted of corruption, financial crimes and gathering people to disturb social order.Mr. Zhang was advising a Wenzhou church when he was detained. The police issued an order to place him under secret detention for up to six months, a colleague of Mr. Zhangs, Yang Xingquan, said in an interview at the time. That procedure, called residential surveillance in an undisclosed location, has been used liberally by the Chinese police under the rule of Mr. Xi, who is overseeing a widespread clampdown on dissent in China and a dismantling of civil society.Mr. Zhang had made an appointment last August to meet with an American State Department official to discuss religious freedom in China but was not able to attend the meeting because of his detention. The authorities charged him with endangering state security and assembling a crowd to disrupt social stability.Last month, Mr. Zhang appeared in a locally televised video in which he said he had worked with foreign groups to stir up trouble over religion. He said he had received payment from China Aid each time he had tried to defend a church or Christian group. He said the group was trying to change Chinas political system.Bob Fu, China Aids director, denounced what he called the Communist Partys propaganda efforts after the video was made public. On Wednesday, China Aid said in a written statement that Mr. Zhang had legally defended about 100 churches affected by the cross-removal campaign.Mr. Fu said of Mr. Zhangs release: As a close friend of Zhang Kai, I am very pleased to hear this good news, although further details about the conditions of his release are still unknown.The Communist Party has been cracking down on human rights lawyers in China since July. As of November, more than 300 had been detained or interrogated. Most were released by December, but some are still in detention and awaiting trial on criminal charges.The party has also been restricting the work of foreign nongovernmental organizations, and it is discussing a law that would limit their activities and bring them under the control of the Public Security Ministry. Peter Dahlin, the Swedish director of a Hong Kong-registered nongovernmental organization that worked with Chinese lawyers, was detained for 23 days in January by the Ministry of State Security and then deported from China. Like Mr. Zhang, he appeared in a televised confession, in which he apologized for hurting the feelings of the Chinese people."}

Garland, has noted that Judge Garland is opposed by the National Federation of Independent Business and that the small-business lobbying group has never before inserted itself in a high-profile court fight.The point Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, is trying to make is that Judge Garlands record is so egregious that even a normally reserved lobbying group is taking on the nominee. But there is another reason as well.The 325,000-member group, known universally as the N.F.I.B., has a new president, Juanita Duggan, and the Garland fight is providing an opportunity to showcase an aggressive posture for the lobbying organization and for her to establish herself.We cant sit this one out, Ms. Duggan, the former head of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said when the nomination was announced.Federation officials say that Judge Garlands record in finding for regulators over businesses might have spurred the organization regardless, but that Ms. Duggans taking the reins last month eliminated any question about whether it would jump in. The group is a plaintiff in two challenges to the Environmental Protection Agency on water and energy regulations moving through the courts.The organization is expected to have much more to say about Judge Garland as the Senate impasse over his nomination continues.\nFollow the New York Times Politics and Washington on Facebook and Twitter, and sign up for the First Draft politics newsletter."}
{"text": "DUBAI  An abandoned oil barrel in the Qatari desert. A line of empty buses that had been used to transport passenger loads of migrants.These images of the modern Middle East, captured by the Syrian photographer Jaber al-Azmeh, were a subtle yet poignant reminder of the world outside Art Dubai, the annual fair that just concluded its 10th edition.The work has political and social undertones, and it also poetically and critically analyzes whats going on around the world and specifically in the region, said Yasmin Atassi, director of Green Art Gallery in Dubai, which represents Mr. Azmeh and showed his work at the fair.Ms. Atassis gallery was among 94 participants from 40 countries at Art Dubai. The fair drew in more than 27,000 visitors to this years edition, which took place March 15 to 19.In addition to collectors from around the world, some 90 museums sent representatives, including the Guggenheim, the British Museum, the Tate, the Pompidou Center and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.There were many discoveries, and it was clear that most galleries brought some of their best work, Glenn Lowry, director of New Yorks Museum of Modern Art, said in an email.Art Dubai is as vital as ever and continues to provide a unique opportunity to see some of the best art in the region, he said.Art Dubai also featured, in addition to the exhibits, the Global Art Forum, a program of talks that included panelists such as the Serpentine Gallerys Hans Ulrich Obrist, the Italian curator Germano Celant and the artist Francesco Vezzoli.Art fairs routinely feature works that reflect the social and economic tenor of the times. Mr. Azmehs starkly modern images  allegories for the recent drop in oil prices and the wrenching migrant crisis  attracted interest, Ms. Atassi said, even if the grittier issues did not come up in conversations with collectors or curators.In fact, Antonia Carver, director of Art Dubai, said that this years turnout was a pleasant surprise.Some collectors from Lagos were saying, These are tough times for us in Nigeria, but were still here, she said.And the turmoil in the region was, for some participants, an incentive rather than a deterrent to attending.Mona Atassi, a former art dealer who moved to Dubai from Damascus in 2012, set up the Atassi Art Foundation last year to preserve and support modern and contemporary Syrian art. This was the foundations first year at Art Dubai.Im not just introducing Syrian art  Im introducing Syria in its natural state, said Mrs. Atassi, who is an aunt of Yasmin Atassi. I dont want to protest or align  this patrimony is all I want to do.A diversity of Syrian art was scattered throughout the fair, which was divided into a Contemporary hall, which featured the majority of galleries, and a Modern section.Its Keith Haring meets Bedouin art, Khaled Samawi, the founder of Ayyam Gallery, said of the paintings of the late Syrian artist Moustafa Fathi, whose estate is represented by the gallery. Its as contemporary as folkloric art can be.Ayyam, which operates in Dubai, Beirut and Damascus, helped 25 of its artists flee Syria at the onset of tensions and seek refuge in Europe and the Middle East.Our whole history is being destroyed, Mr. Samawi said. I feel it is my responsibility to preserve the art and culture of today.Art Dubais Modern section was introduced in 2014 and has become a regular stop for museum curators looking to deepen and broaden their regional holdings, Ms. Carver said.International museums have tended to come through the Contemporary, and now theyre looking back at the 20th century and thinking, Hang on, this was a global decade  the world was always moving and artists were moving more than anyone else, she said.Among the modern Middle Eastern artists on view this year were the Iranian-born Maliheh Afnan, a graduate of the Corcoran School of Art, whose work was inspired by script and ancient relics, and Pakistans celebrated calligrapher and painter Syed Sadequain.Though it is in Modern where six-figure artworks hang, the Contemporary exhibits a variety of midrange works  a financial positioning that Art Dubai has maintained over the last decade.We dont advertise ourselves as a fair for the million-dollar collector, Ms. Carver said.Still, six-figure sums were paid for sculptures by the Spanish artist Jaume Plensa (300,000 euros, or $337,000) at New Yorks Galerie Lelong, and by the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama (between $400,000 and 600,000) at Londons Victoria Miro gallery.The Contemporary section featured the German-Iranian artist Timo Nasseris sculpture Unknown Letter 2. The work was inspired by the 10th-century calligrapher Ibn Muqla, who created four additional letters that he believed the Arabic language was missing. Attacked by clerics for blasphemy, he died after his right, working arm was amputated and his tongue cut off.To create the piece, Mr. Nasseri used the planetarium software Stellarium to study the constellations over Baghdad in the year 935, believing, as scholars did then, that the answers lay in the stars.He located two of Ibn Muqlas letters and rendered one of them in walnut. It sold to a collector for $50,000 at Beirut and Hamburgs Sfeir-Semler Gallery, which has been coming to Art Dubai since the fairs inception.Im committed to this part of the world, and this is why I keep coming back, said Andre Sfeir-Semler, the gallerys director, who also sits on the fairs selection committee.Another Art Dubai regular, Agial Art Gallery, from Beirut, presented sculptures by emerging Arab artists such as Abdelrahman Katanani, a resident of Beiruts Sabra refugee camp. A piece of his, made from barbed wire, found a buyer at the fair.I think Art Dubai is the most accomplished platform where a gallery coming from Beirut, which is a little marginalized today, can meet the people it needs to meet on a global level, said Saleh Barakat, the founder of Agial Art Gallery. Coming here, I see everybody."}
{"text": "Memo to the Republican senators who refuse to consider President Obamas Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland: When it comes to business issues, Judge Garland is about as good as you could hope for.Thats because if there is any overriding philosophy in Judge Garlands writing and opinions, dating to his earliest law review articles, it is judicial restraint  a deference to decisions by elected officials and those they appoint. Judicial restraint is a doctrine long cherished by conservatives and Republicans, as well as many judicial scholars across the ideological spectrum.Since Judge Garland sits on the United States Court of Appeals in Washington  in what is known as the District of Columbia Circuit  his docket has been heavy with appeals of decisions by administrative agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency or the National Labor Relations Board. In the overwhelming majority of those cases, he deferred to those agencies decisions. The Supreme Court justice whose language his most closely resembles is none other than Antonin Scalia, the conservative justice whom Judge Garland would replace.Justice Scalia delivered a ringing endorsement of judicial deference to administrative decisions in a 1989 speech at Duke University's law school. The legislative process becomes less of a sporting event, he said, when administrative disputes will be resolved, within the bounds of permissible interpretation, not by the courts but by a particular agency.Of all the Supreme Court justices, Scalia was the most outspoken proponent of judicial deference to agency actions, said Richard J. Pierce Jr., a law professor at George Washington University and the author of the widely cited three-volume Administrative Law Treatise.Still, the analogy can be taken only so far; no one expects Judge Garland to be another firebrand in the Scalia mold. Justice Scalia was the strongest proponent of deference, but the weakest practitioner of it, Professor Pierce said. Judge Garland shares the first of those values and not the second. In that regard, he said, Judge Garland more closely resembles Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.(In a ranking of all 35 Supreme Court justices from 1946 to 2011 based on friendliness to business by two law professors, Lee Epstein and William Landes, along with a federal appeals court judge, Richard A. Posner, Justice Roberts ranked second. Justice Scalia was ninth.)Business interests have a tremendous stake in the next justice, since the loss of Justice Scalia ended a five-to-four pro-business majority on the court that has endured since the Reagan administration. Among issues of intense interest to business expected to wend their way to the court are the status of class actions, the rights of organized labor, employment discrimination, access to courts and political contributions by business and labor.The District of Columbia Circuit gets relatively few explicit business cases; far more end up in the Second Circuit, which includes New York. Judge Garlands reputation as a moderate comes primarily from his rulings in criminal cases favoring prosecutors and law enforcement officials. But even those opinions can be viewed as showing deference toward elected or appointed officials, which most law enforcement officers are.In and of itself, the doctrine of judicial restraint is neither liberal nor conservative. The ideological outcome depends on the particular presidential administration and the legislative agenda to which a judge is deferring. Justice Scalias remarks at Duke came during the early days of the administration of President George H. W. Bush and just after the Reagan era of deregulation, when administrative decisions reflected the mostly conservative values prevailing in those administrations.Many of Judge Garlands recent opinions upholding administrative actions, including numerous appeals from National Labor Relations Board decisions that have been interpreted as favoring organized labor, simply reflect the ideological cast of the Obama administrations appointees to the board. Judge Garland was also a federal appeals court judge during the George W. Bush administration, when he appears to have been no less willing to uphold agency decisions.Alarmed by the pro-labor outcome in many of these recent cases, some have been quick to oppose Judge Garlands confirmation. The National Federation of Independent Business said it opposed his confirmation because Judge Garland would be a strong ally of the regulatory bureaucracy, big labor and trial lawyers.But the small-business federation is not exactly an impartial observer: It has two challenges to the authority of the Environmental Protection Agency pending before the Supreme Court. The small-business lobby may well want an activist justice who it believes will rule in its favor, but thats self-interest, not principle.Hannah Belitz, a student at Harvard Law School who contributes to the blog On Labor, analyzed 22 Garland opinions involving the National Labor Relations Board and found that he sided with the agency in all but four. She acknowledged that while the language of his opinions speaks repeatedly of a need for judicial deference to agency decision-making, nonetheless the effect of that deference is favorable to labor and unions. Her work has been widely cited as evidence that Judge Garland is a captive of Big Labor.But since the Supreme Courts landmark ruling in Chevron v. National Resources Defense Council  the very ruling Justice Scalia praised in his speech at Duke  it has been settled law that courts should defer to most administrative rulings. Even the most conservative appeals court judges tend to agree.Nearly all of Judge Garlands opinions were in unanimous decisions by three-judge panels of the District of Columbia Circuit, which includes many Republican appointees and some very conservative judges. In one labor relations board case, Judge Garland was joined by Judge Janice Rogers Brown, a 2005 Bush appointee considered by many to be a libertarian in the mold of Justice Clarence Thomas. And Laurence Silberman and David Sentelle, two of the courts most conservative judges, have lavished praise on Judge Garland.I dont see much significance in the N.L.R.B. cases, said Professor Pierce of George Washington University. I read all the D.C. Circuit opinions. Ive always thought of him as a moderate and I still do. The fact that he has rarely issued separate opinions from his Republican colleagues suggests he isnt strongly influenced by political or ideological considerations.In an example of Judge Garlands approach that resulted in a pro-business opinion, he sided with banks and brokerage firms  and against consumer advocates  arguing that judges should defer to a Securities and Exchange Commission ruling that exempted broker dealers who provide fee-based investment advice from the Investment Advisers Act. The opinion is one of Judge Garlands rare dissents from a majority ruling, which was written by a judge nominated by President Bill Clinton.I spoke this week with David Rivkin, a partner at Baker & Hostetler in Washington, a prominent libertarian who was a leading architect of the legal campaign to declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. Judge Garland is an extremely impressive lawyer and judge, he said.While Mr. Rivkin said he would like to see the Supreme Court impose greater constitutional checks on the power of the executive branch, he nonetheless agrees that judicial restraint and deference to administrative authority are not really partisan issues.It all depends on who the political masters are, Mr. Rivkin said. Administrative agencies can make bad decisions that are both liberal and conservative. Im really surprised my progressive friends seem so eager to confer this boundless faith on the wisdom of bureaucrats. The next political master could be Trump.Judge Garland has drawn opposition from the left, though it has been relatively muted. The Democratic candidate Senator Bernie Sanders said he would not have chosen him, and if elected president before Judge Garland were confirmed, he would ask that Mr. Obama withdraw the nomination in favor of someone more progressive. The National Organization for Women said it was unfortunate that Mr. Obama chose someone whose record on womens issues was a blank slate. Mark Joseph Stern in Slate called him an extraordinarily disappointing choice. And hes a Harvard-educated white man with a wife and family. No diversity there.Judge Garlands judicial philosophy on the appeals court suggests Republican senators should consider shifting course and confirming a bird in the hand.Judge Garland is an accomplished lawyer and a respected judge with a powerful legal mind, Tobias Barrington Wolff, a professor of constitutional law at the University of Pennsylvania, said. He is also the most centrist nominee that the Republican leadership could reasonably have imagined from a Democratic president."}

The news was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.When the Playboy Mansion was listed for sale earlier this year, the person said, it prompted potential buyers to begin expressing interest in buying the entire company, and Playboy decided to explore that interest. Those potential buyers are based both in the United States and abroad but none are domestic media companies, the person said. They have not yet met with Playboy, which would be valued at around $500 million.Playboy, which was founded by Hugh Hefner in 1953, now makes most of its money from licensing its ubiquitous brand and logo across the world, for bath products, fragrances, clothing, liquor and jewelry among other things. About 40 percent of that business comes from China, though the magazine is not available there."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re When Did Porn Become Sex Ed?, by Peggy Orenstein (Sunday Review, March 20):We cant shift the sex education paradigm until we acknowledge the monumental changes in American society and in young peoples physiology that have coalesced to create a 12-to-13-year gap between sexual and reproductive maturity and age at first marriage. In the absence of adult preparation and guidance, how surprised should we be that so many young people turn to pornography and hookup culture?In the parent groups I work with, I ask: Who is responsible for teaching your children how to have an informed, caring and ethical sexual life? Arent these the values we teach in every other aspect of child development? Why would sexuality be different?Educating for yes means helping young people make wise decisions by asking themselves, Under what circumstances is participating in a particular sexual experience right for me and another person, and under what circumstances is it better, or even vital, that I decline?What young people wont ever get from pornography or hookups is an understanding of the profound connections among sex, intimacy and the willingness to bring your whole self  not simply your body  to a sexual experience. Thats up to us.DEBORAH M. ROFFMANBaltimoreThe writer, a teacher of human sexuality at the Park School of Baltimore, is the author of Talk to Me First: Everything You Need to Know to Become Your Kids Go To Person About Sex.To the Editor:Peggy Orenstein posits a scenario in which boys are in control, get what they want (orgasm) and girls are victims, taking a subservient, unsatisfying role. But equating a boys orgasm with getting what he wants is wrong.Boys, too, want love and connection. It is precisely because of a lack of education that boys have no idea about their partners needs or that there should be more to sex than orgasm. And they miss out.When I look back on my own sexual life, I am filled with regrets. All I had to go on were rumor and instinct.Without honest discussion and education, both boys and girls miss out on truly meaningful sex and the love that can blossom in the nurturing context of a loving, mutually satisfying sexual relationship.JOHN R. DORCHESTERMedia, Pa.To the Editor:As a gynecologist and sexual health expert, I am aware that too many of my adult patients have quietly given up or drastically compromised their expectations of having enjoyable sex beyond satisfying a partner. In the 2013 Revive survey of sexual behavior, 72 percent of women admitted that they silently endured painful intercourse to please their partner.Most women are never given the information or the tools to help them reach orgasm, alleviate pain or overcome a loss of libido. Studies consistently show that it is the rare woman who asks for help, and if she does, most physicians are ill equipped to offer meaningful suggestions.So yes, we need to have the conversation with our daughters about a womans entitlement to sexual pleasure, but first we must find a way to educate the mothers.LAUREN F. STREICHERChicagoThe writer, medical director of the Northwestern Center for Sexual Medicine, is the author of Sex Rx: Hormones, Health and Your Best Sex Ever.To the Editor:Peggy Orenstein leaves the impression that American society is completely lacking in more honest and value-sensitive alternatives to abstinence-only sex education. If only she had mentioned the programs of secular organizations like Planned Parenthood, and those of religious groups that aim to infuse sexuality education with values of interpersonal responsibility and mutual respect.Among such religious groups, Our Whole Lives, a curriculum developed jointly by the United Church of Christ and the Unitarian Universalist Association, presents factual information and encourages values-centered dialogue in several developmentally appropriate versions across a wide age span, from kindergarten through mature adulthood.Parents and young adults alike who have participated in such programs strongly testify to their value in dispelling ignorance and grounding sexual decision-making in a moral perspective of human values and relational mutuality.(Rev.) JAY ATKINSONEl Sobrante, Calif.The writer is a research scholar at the Starr King School for the Ministry, a Unitarian Universalist seminary in Berkeley, Calif.To the Editor:There is another disturbing trend in adolescent sexual activity that wasnt mentioned. There is an apparent need by some teenagers to perform sexual acts in public places (including the Internet) or before peers. This lack of privacy and absence of intimacy create a setting that disallows the very behaviors that Peggy Orenstein promotes: consensual, responsible, loving and (yes) enjoyable sex.Sex is not a performance. Girls should never be coerced into behaviors that are painful and demeaning or that they merely endure. Young women need to be told to expect sexual gratification from their partners. Kudos to Ms. Orenstein for daring to bring this topic to our attention.JAN CHARLTONNorth Eastham, Mass.The writer is a former high school principal."}
{"text": "GONE WITH THE MINDBy Mark Leyner250 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $25.An absurdist autobiography is either a contradiction in terms or a redundancy, depending on how you look at it. Either the purpose of an autobiography is to make sense of the writers life, in which case absurdity would be a severe impediment  or else life itself is absurd, and all autobiographies are too. In his new autobiographical novel, Gone With the Mind, Mark Leyner seems to split the difference: He makes sense of his life by unpacking just how ridiculous it is to be alive.Gone With the Mind is a blindingly weird novel: a book-length stand-up routine in which a man free-associates about his life to a mostly empty room, mixing the philosophical and the scatological with abandon. At times, it seems to be an argument against autobiography, as well as a lament about the impossibility of actually communicating with an audience. But after Leyner gets done slicing the fictionalized version of his life into small and disconnected fragments, the slivers turn out to draw blood.The protagonist of Gone With the Mind is a frustrated author named Mark Leyner, theoretically reading from his autobiography in the empty food court of a mall deserted because of flash-flood warnings. The only audience members are his mother and two restaurant workers who insist theyre not there to listen to Leyner  not that they have much choice. But instead of reading from his book, the fictional Leyner delivers 200-odd pages of remarks that circle endlessly and encapsulate what T.S. Eliot probably meant by the boredom, the horror and the glory.The real-world Leyner is well known for playing such postmodern games in his books, though in Gone With the Mind he has knocked his fictional counterpart down a few pegs. In his acclaimed 1992 novel, Et Tu, Babe, the protagonist is the famous novelist Mark Leyner, a Schwarzeneggerian bermensch who lives in a lavish compound called Leyner H.Q. and is worshiped by a legion of fans called Team Leyner. And his follow-up novel, The Tetherballs of Bougainville, features another hero named Mark Leyner, a prizewinning teenage screenwriter.Along with the fictional Leyners new reduction of fortunes comes a narrowing of focus. Here there are no state-sanctioned assassins or nonagenarian cyborg bodyguards, not even the offbeat gods who starred in Leyners previous novel, The Sugar Frosted Nutsack. Instead, the narrator obsesses about the minutiae of his childhood, along with his recent prostate cancer and the resulting prostatectomy, his fetish for womens armpits, random things he saw on television. These details really become bizarre only when theyre held up to the light, but they remain personal and occasionally poignant.The books main surreal touch is the Imaginary Intern, a figure the fictional Leyner conjures from the pattern of cracks in a restrooms floor tiles. The Imaginary Intern serves as a kind of amanuensis as Leyner conceives his autobiography, which starts out as a first-person-shooter video game in which the player has to travel backward through Leyners life, undoing each incident until at last Leyner is unraveled in his mothers womb. (Benito Mussolini, in a flying balcony, carries the player from scene to scene.) The autobiography, we are told, has mutated away from that initial concept, but we never really find out what it has become.If the books running monologue seems aimless, this is completely intentional. The fictional Leyner keeps coming back to the idea that all narrative conventions, including anecdotes and vignettes, are debased and to be avoided; his hope, he says, is that one could eradicate all the quaint handicraft synonymous with an autobiography. He occasionally cites a maxim coined by Japanese manga artists: Yama nashi, ochi nashi, imi nashi, meaning, No climax, no resolution, no meaning.But along with the main characters penchant for taking tiny details and magnifying them until they appear wildly silly, much of the energy in Gone With the Mind comes from his audience. The main characters mother, who arranged the food-court appearance, delivers a 40-page introduction before he speaks, and were periodically reminded shes there listening to him, as he overshares about his childhood and occasionally insults her. Then theres the small Greek chorus of food-court workers, who are vexed to listen to this nonsense and appear to be a proxy for some real-life readers who might not appreciate the Yama nashi, ochi nashi, imi nashi of it all.But if you learn to roll with the Tristram- Shandy-on-nondrowsy-cough-syrup circumlocution, Gone With the Mind may worm into your brain. Leyner makes the case fairly late in the book for a kind of meaning through randomness: In the same way that tarot cards, taken in a group, signify something, a burst of vivid, unconnected images can leave a powerful impression.When you strip away the conceit that its a metafictional author presenting a nonexistent autobiography, and ignore the two workers from Sbarro and Panda Express, Gone With the Mind begins to seem more like a man speaking to his mother about his life. His fear of mortality in the wake of a cancer scare, joined to his obsessive reclamation of childhood, add up to a kind of Freudian desire to be reunited with his mother, whos right there listening to all this. As the narrator says at one point, the mother is the great hole in your life, and the more you fly away from her, the more you actually fly toward her. That insight is, like this book, truly absurd and absurdly true."}
{"text": "Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, dropped a memorable line at the end of his letter this week recommending no prison time for Peter Liang, the former New York City police officer convicted of manslaughter last month in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man in a housing project stairwell.There are no winners here, he wrote.Mr. Thompson was referring primarily to the two chief players in the tragic drama: Mr. Liangs victim, Akai Gurley  a completely innocent man who lost his life for no reason  and Mr. Liang himself, who has already lost his job and who stands to lose his freedom when he is sentenced next month.But along the way the case has had winners, and losers, though it has at times been hard to tell them apart. When Mr. Thompsons letter was released on Wednesday, Mr. Gurleys family and criminal-justice reform activists expressed outrage, just several weeks after having applauded Mr. Liangs conviction, and before that his indictment. In a stark but mirroring contrast, the citys police unions and many in its Chinese-American community denounced the indictment and conviction, but they are now praising prosecutors and cheering the prospect that Mr. Liang, who is of Chinese heritage, might avoid prison.If the best settlements are those in which each side leaves unhappy, then it could be that Mr. Thompson has himself emerged a winner, if a battered one, near the end of the sort of polarizing police misconduct case that can define a district attorneys career. A first-term prosecutor with electoral potential, he had much to lose by even pursuing the case, which was fraught from the start with legal hurdles and political pitfalls.A blameless man had been killed by the police, but the officer was not one with a history of violence or who had obviously acted out of malice. Instead, he was a rookie officer on a dangerous assignment who had only recently left the Police Academy.In the end, Mr. Thompson has arguably managed to get the best he could: praise and fury from nearly everyone involved.What is all but impossible to divine is how, or even whether, Mr. Thompson, a Democrat, weighed the unofficial but unavoidable considerations: the politics of a diverse borough that made him the first black district attorney in Brooklyns history; the tension that prosecutors face in weighing justice and mercy; and the powerful influence of the Police Department, whose officers work closely with him and his staff and which once counted his mother among its ranks.Or perhaps, Mr. Thompson, who declined to be interviewed for this article, just went with his gut.Prosecutors face enormous pressure, said Representative Kathleen M. Rice, a Democrat who once served as the Nassau County district attorney. If youre not prepared to be disliked by one or both sides in a criminal case, then being a D.A. is probably not the job for you.From the moment in November 2014 that Mr. Thompson learned of Mr. Gurleys death  by a ricocheting bullet in a dark stairwell of the Louis H. Pink Houses in East New York  he found himself confronting bedeviling facts: the innocent victim, the broken lights in the notoriously dangerous housing project, and the inexperience of Mr. Liang and his partner.On the other hand, as Mr. Thompsons prosecutors pointedly noted at the trial, Mr. Liang and his partner failed to assist Mr. Gurley even after they realized the bullet had actually struck someone.Politically, Mr. Thompson faced a mix of competing constituencies, none of which were timid in expressing their opinions. Much of the police force, which carries out most of the investigative legwork for a district attorneys prosecutions, said Mr. Liang should not be indicted. Large swaths of the citys growing Asian-American population expressed the same sentiment.At the same time, the shooting came only four months after the death of Eric Garner, another unarmed black man, who was killed in an encounter with the police on Staten Island. The case fueled protests in New York and across the country, especially after a grand jury declined to indict the officer who had placed Mr. Garner in a chokehold, which was a cause of his death.Adding to the already considerable pressure was Mr. Thompsons own biography: He was both Brooklyns first black district attorney, who had campaigned as a reformer promising to restore a sense of fairness to communities of color, and the son of a police officer who understood, from personal experience, the exigencies of police work.He was in an extremely difficult spot because he had to reconcile a number of different interests, said Alan Vinegrad, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Mr. Thompson in the late 1990s on the Abner Louima police brutality case. Forget about the politics, strictly from a do-the-right thing perspective, it was hard to achieve justice for the victim.For nearly a year and a half, Mr. Thompson has been saying that his decisions in the Gurley case have been driven by the evidence, not politics. And yet it remains that the office of district attorney is an elected one. Even many of his loudest critics, including those, like Mr. Liangs lawyer, who thought that an indictment should never have been brought, have said his sentencing decision was at the very least reasonable.Mr. Thompsons letter is only a recommendation, and the final sentencing decision rests with Justice Danny K. Chun of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, who could give Mr. Liang as much as 15 years in prison.But by urging only probation and a brief period of house arrest, Mr. Thompson, wittingly or not, has created a situation in which a sentence that includes any time behind bars could seem a tough penalty and perhaps mollify some of those who opposed his recommendation.Whatever political fallout there is from his decision is likely to emerge only in time as he seeks re-election or tries for higher office. As People v. Liang returns again to the courthouse for the sentencing on April 14, legal questions will take precedence.Did the officer win? No, Mr. Vinegrad said. Did the victim win? Obviously not.

{"text": "CAIRO   The Egyptian authorities pressed ahead Thursday with a case against the founders of two prominent human rights organizations, part of a crackdown on civil society organizations that have documented government abuse.The accusations against the founder of Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, Hossam Bahgat, and Gamal Eid, the founder of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information, include charges of illegally receiving foreign funding and appear to be a continuation of a criminal investigation brought in 2011 against foreign groups operating in Egypt.Officials have threatened to expand the prosecution of Egyptian nongovernmental organizations for more than two years; Thursdays hearing is the latest indication that the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi intends to follow through.In the hearing, the judge, Mohamed Shorbagi, was weighing whether to freeze the assets of Mr. Bahgat, who now works a journalist, and Mr. Eid, along with the assets of Mr. Eids wife and their 11-year-old daughter.Defense lawyers argued that the hearing was premature because investigators had yet to formally present their clients with evidence of wrongdoing. Judge Shorbagi adjourned the case until next month.The government has already barred Mr. Bahgat and Mr. Eid from leaving Egypt. In recent weeks, the authorities have also detained and threatened criminal charges against Negad al-Borai, another prominent rights advocate who was in court Thursday supporting Mr. Bahgat.Groups that document abuses have come under intense pressure. The authorities have threatened to close the Nadeem Center, which counsels victims of torture, and called for the interrogation of the director of a leading womens advocacy group, Nazra for Feminist Studies.These actions against the groups indicate that the government is broadening its battle against perceived opponents after several years of mass arrests of Islamist and leftist dissidents. And it comes at a time when Mr. Sisi has shown growing impatience with his detractors as his government struggles with domestic discontent, economic difficulties and threats from a jihadist insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula.When the investigation into foreign nonprofit groups started in 2011, the Egyptian authorities charged American and German groups with receiving foreign funding in violation of Egyptian law. The government has threatened for more than two years to bring similar charges against Egyptian groups that rely at least in part on financial contributions from international foundations and agencies.The governments effort has also underscored the persistent view in Egypts ruling circles that domestic civil society groups are little more than a front for foreign governments seeking to undermine the countrys stability.In a television interview in late January, Ahmed el-Zend, who until recently was justice minister, said that nongovernmental groups were using funds from the United States and other countries as part of a conspiracy against Egypt and vowed that the authorities would take action.It will not pass, he said. Everyones turn will come.For days before the court hearing on Thursday, international organizations and even some of Egypts allies, including the United States, Britain and Germany, warned about the escalating crackdown by the government.On Wednesday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, condemned the governments pursuit of civil society groups, saying it serves to stifle the voices of those who advocate for the victims.Mr. Bahgat, one of the defendants, said shortly before his hearing that he was not optimistic about the outcome and believed the asset freeze was a precursor to more serious criminal charges. I think the current regime is very aware of the drop in domestic approval and of the loss of international support, and they are convinced we are to blame, he said.The international pressure may have affected the outcome of the hearing. In an unusual request, it was the prosecutor, rather than defense lawyers, who asked to delay the hearing without a ruling."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  Tensions between Yahoo and its most outspoken shareholder, the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, were already running high when the two sides agreed early this year on a face-to-face meeting in Manhattan.But on the morning of that meeting on March 10, Yahoo surprised Starboard when it filled two vacancies on its board without consulting the hedge fund, in what many viewed as a poke in the eye.For Starboard, the meeting was yet another bad omen. And on Thursday the hedge fund made good on its months-old threat to try to unseat the ailing web pioneers board.In running nine candidates to try to oust all the incumbent directors, the hedge fund is seeking to claim its biggest corporate scalp yet. And Yahoo must defend itself while also trying to explore a potential sale of its core business.The slate  which includes a former executive at NBCUniversal and a former technology banker at Deutsche Bank as well as Starboards chief executive, Jeffrey Smith  represents the strongest challenge to a board of a major American company in some time. Just 30 or so companies have experienced the ouster of their full boards as a result of activist campaigns, according to data from FactSet.The most prominent victim in recent years was Darden Restaurants, the owner of Olive Garden, whose entire board was ousted by shareholders. Its tormentor: Starboard, which memorably accused the restaurant operator of insufficiently salting its pasta water and overserving breadsticks.As you know from reading our prior letters, we have been attempting to work with Yahoo for the past 18 months, Mr. Smith wrote in a public letter to investors on Thursday. Over this time frame, we have repeatedly requested an opportunity to work with the company, including offers to join the board and work constructively with the current directors. At every step of the way, management and the board have pushed us away.Yahoo said in a statement that it would review Starboards slate of director candidates. The board election will take place at Yahoos annual meeting, expected sometime in June or July.Robert Peck, an analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, said that shareholder dissatisfaction with Yahoo was broad, and that Starboard has a good chance of winning the proxy contest.Shares of Yahoo closed up slightly on Thursday, at $34.86.It is unclear whether Starboard would ever have settled for less than majority control of Yahoos board. But people with knowledge of the hedge funds strategy, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the firm had lost faith in Yahoos ability to find a turnaround strategy that would work and then doubted the companys sincerity in exploring a sale of its mainstay web operations.Eventually it came to the conclusion that wholesale change would be needed to ensure a sale.Yahoo has argued that it is serious about potentially selling itself, pointing to the hiring of three investment banks and reaching out to a constellation of potential bidders, ranging from telecommunications giants like Verizon to media companies to private equity financiers.Several potential bidders have had talks with Microsoft over whether it might back a bid for Yahoo, according to a person briefed on the matter. Such an investment would most likely be in the hundreds of millions of dollars.The talks were reported earlier on Thursday by Recode.But in its letter, Starboard, which owns a 1.7 percent stake in Yahoo, contends that there are reasons for shareholders to be highly concerned about the sale process. Some potential buyers have questioned whether the company is serious.Despite what appears to be strong interest from large strategic and financial buyers, as referenced in the media, nearly two months have gone by since Yahoo officially publicly announced its intention to pursue strategic alternatives for the core business, and it seems little progress has been made, it said.Since first emerging as an investor in the Internet company in late 2014, Starboard has repeatedly criticized Yahoos management, led by Marissa Mayer, the chief executive, as well as the companys board.The embattled technology company has struggled to find a successful new direction as it has been eclipsed by rivals of all stripes.Starboard has not always succeeded in its efforts to push for change at Yahoo. The hedge fund twice has called for the company to merge with its fellow first-generation web company AOL, but failed to persuade either company to pursue such a deal.Yahoo is no stranger to activist shareholders, who seek to change up a businesss strategy, often by waging noisy public battles. Nearly four years ago, the hedge fund titan Daniel S. Loeb took aim at the company and helped orchestrate the ouster of its chief executive, eventually claiming three seats on the board and pushing for the hiring of Ms. Mayer, a former top Google executive.Yahoo executives have repeatedly expressed frustration over the pressure from the latest wave of activist investors attacking them. In an interview on the Charlie Rose program two weeks ago, Ms. Mayer argued that the company had served shareholders well by applying most of the proceeds of its previous sales of Alibaba stock toward buying back Yahoo shares.Yahoo has also noted that its initial plan to spin off its 15 percent stake in Alibaba, announced in January 2015, was adopted in response to pressure from shareholders, including Starboard.When the Internal Revenue Service declined last fall to affirm that the spinoff would be tax-free, many shareholders, including Starboard, urged the company to abandon the plan.In December, Yahoo did just that and said it would instead seek to spin off its core operating businesses to minimize the tax bill.But Yahoo has clearly been reluctant to pursue the top objective of Starboard and other activists: selling the companys core business of search, websites and mobile apps. That business has continued to decline over the nearly four years since Ms. Mayer took over as chief executive.Although the company formed a strategic review committee to consider possible offers a month ago, potential bidders have complained that the company has dragged its feet.The company seemed to halfheartedly embrace the concept of pursuing strategic alternatives, said Scott Kessler, an analyst with Standard & Poors Global Market Intelligence.Yahoo has always been reluctant to consider a sale of its core business, dating back to its wholesale rejection of Microsofts $45 billion offer for the company in February 2008, he noted."}
{"text": "The Zika virus now spreading widely throughout the hemisphere probably arrived in the Americas in a single traveler in the second half of 2013  almost a year earlier than previous estimates  according to a new study of the viruss genome led by Brazilian and British researchers.Experts were divided in their opinions of the new study, published Thursday in the journal Science. Some praised the work, while others said it was too limited to draw such a specific conclusion.By counting mutations in the viral genomes in different blood samples over time, the scientists created a molecular clock that estimates how fast the virus mutated.The researchers then compared new samples with earlier ones from Asia, where the Zika virus had circulated for decades, and from the South Pacific, where it began circulating in 2007. The team calculated that the Zika virus arrived in the Americas between May and December 2013.They also concluded that it probably  but not necessarily  arrived in Brazil first.The virus was not positively identified in Brazil until May 2015. But by then it had clearly been circulating in the countrys northeast for many months, because cities there were experiencing large outbreaks of a mysterious disease causing rash, fever and bloodshot eyes.(The virus did not become headline news around the world until December, when health officials in Brazil, alarmed over a surge in infants born with tiny heads, warned women not to become pregnant. The World Health Organization declared a global health emergency on Feb. 1.)The new study relies on just 23 viral genomes. They include samples of Zika virus obtained in Thailand, French Polynesia and the Cook Islands and 20 in the Americas, including nine from Brazil and the rest from Colombia, Martinique, Haiti, Guatemala, Suriname and Puerto Rico.The Haitian virus was noted as being particularly unusual, because it was collected in December 2014  more than a year before the viruss presence in Haiti was confirmed by the W.H.O. this past January.The gene sequences from the Americas were all closely related, and most resembled one collected in French Polynesia in November 2013.Two earlier studies have suggested that the virus reached Brazil either with the influx of athletes and tourists arriving for the 2014 soccer World Cup, which was played in host cities all over Brazil in June to July that year, or for the Vaa World Sprints, a set of outrigger canoe races held in Rio de Janeiro in mid-August of that year.Those assumptions were based on air traffic patterns, not viral sequencing. A large Zika outbreak in French Polynesia began in 2013 and spread to New Caledonia, the Cook Islands and Easter Island.No soccer team from the South Pacific played in the 2014 World Cup, but many teams from the affected South Pacific nations were among the 2,000 paddlers competing in the Vaa.The new study notes, however, that French Polynesias outbreak peaked and crashed in only five months, and was nearly over by February 2014, making it unlikely that the virus left there for Brazil in July or August.I think we can now discount the whole World Cup connection, said Kristian G. Andersen, a disease geneticist at the Scripps Research Institute, who said he felt the number of sequences used in the study was fairly small but enough so that the main conclusions are likely to be valid.The new studys researchers also noted that, in June 2013, the FIFA Confederations Cup, a prelude to the World Cup, was played in Brazil. It included a team from Tahiti, which is part of French Polynesia; the team played one game in Recife, one of the northeastern cities where the outbreak was first seen.Oliver G. Pybus, a disease geneticist at Oxford University and one of the papers authors, said the viruss arrival during the Confederations Cup was within the range of possibilities but not something you can capture scientifically.That tournament took place before the first cases in French Polynesia were reported. Until this year, however, few doctors had even heard of Zika, and it was often misdiagnosed as dengue or other diseases.Peter Palese, the chairman of the microbiology department at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who has calculated molecular clocks for flu viruses, said he felt that calculating a viruss geographical movements based on so few genome sequences was to be quite harsh, ridiculous.You need hundreds or even thousands of strains to really say anything, he said.But Michael Worobey, a disease geneticist at the University of Arizona, said he found the new studys findings robust because the genetic sequences were long and had what he called a clear, clocklike signal.People have a tendency to not imagine that viruses can circulate under the radar for a long time, Dr. Worobey added. But H.I.V. circulated for decades in Africa before it was noticed.Yes, the tip of the Zika iceberg rose up in Brazil, he added. But the base of the iceberg might be a little more complicated than some people getting on a plane for a sporting event."}

{"text": "SEOUL, South Korea   A man claiming to be a naturalized American citizen held in North Korea since October confessed to committing crimes against the country and pleaded for mercy on Friday, news agencies reported from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.The man, Kim Dong-chul, appeared at a government-arranged news conference and apologized for trying to steal military secrets in collusion with South Koreans, the Kyodo News agency of Japan reported. Xinhua, the Chinese news agency, carried a similar report.Mr. Kim, in a blue suit, kept his head bowed and his hands folded in front of him as uniformed North Korean officials escorted him to the news conference, according to photos carried by Kyodo on its website.Mr. Kims detainment was disclosed when the North Korean government arranged for CNN to interview him in Pyongyang in January.In that interview, Mr. Kim said he was a 62-year-old naturalized American citizen from Fairfax, Va., and used to run a trading and hotel services company in Rason, a special economic zone that North Korea operates near its borders with China and Russia.Mr. Kim said he had begun spying on behalf of South Korean conservative elements in 2013, by bribing North Korean residents to collect data about the Norths military and its nuclear program. He said he was arrested in October while he was meeting one of his local sources, a former North Korean soldier.The United States State Department has declined to comment on the case, saying speaking publicly about detained Americans can complicate its efforts to secure their freedom.Last week, North Koreas Supreme Court sentenced an American college student, Otto F. Warmbier, to 15 years of hard labor. He was convicted of trying to steal a political banner from his hotel in Pyongyang.Over the years, North Korea has detained several Americans on accusations of illegal entry or spying and other antistate crimes. It has often permitted them to speak to outside news media in interviews or at news conferences in Pyongyang.They invariably confessed to committing crimes and apologized, asking North Korea for leniency and urging their governments to facilitate their release. But some told reporters after their release that officials had coerced them into making such statements.Relations between North Korea and the United States are particularly delicate. The North conducted a nuclear test on Jan. 6 and launched a long-range rocket last month, prompting Washington and its allies to seek tougher United Nations sanctions on Pyongyang.The North has also used American detainees to increase its diplomatic leverage against Washington, releasing some only after prominent American officials like former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter visited the country."}
{"text": "The beams are still bare in Yogasmogas first Manhattan store, juice bar and fitness studio. But Rishi Bali raves that he is building the next Lululemon  only better.He certainly brings a hip pedigree to the table. Mr. Bali is from the foothills of the Himalayas, a birthplace of yoga, which he says flows in his blood. He honed his business skills at Goldman Sachs, where he was an operations executive.And he is off to a fast start. His company, which started in 2013 by selling yoga gear online, has already expanded to 12 brick-and-mortar stores. He plans to build as many as 25 stores this year, including the store in Manhattans chic NoHo neighborhood, which opens in June. He is investing his venture capital money  he has raised $12.5 million  in high-tech performance fabrics and American manufacturing.Were going to be better than Lululemon, just more authentic, Mr. Bali said. Were different from other brands jumping on that athleisure bandwagon.That may be easier said than done.Seemingly every clothing brand and retailer wants in on so-called athleisure, a category that has become so prevalent that it has won an entry in the next update of the Merriam-Webster dictionary: casual clothing meant to be worn both for exercising and for doing almost everything else.Louis Vuitton is selling athleisure. So are Victorias Secret, Gap, Tory Burch and H&M. Online-only portals have introduced options: Net-a-Porter now runs Net-a-Sporter. Gyms and workout companies, like SoulCycle, are creating clothing lines.Nike, Under Armour and Adidas, the traditional sportswear giants, are all stepping up their offerings for the yoga-mat-toting demographic, promoting splashy collaborations with celebrities like Pharrell Williams and Rihanna. Sweaty Betty, the fast-growing British athleisure brand, is expanding in the United States.A result: The $97 billion athleisure market  including athletic apparel, footwear and accessories  is being stretched more than Lululemons stretchiest yoga pants.Already, some signs of strain are showing. Nike spooked investors  many of whom had bought into the athleisure boom  by reporting slowing sales on Tuesday. The athletics giant warned that revenue growth could slow further this year, to the midsingle digits, down from initial estimates of almost 10 percent.That came after Urban Outfitters in October scaled back its promotion of the companys athleisure brand, just a little more than a year after introducing it. Theory said early this year that it would not move forward with its stand-alone activewear line, Theory Plus.Kit and Ace, the start-up operated by the family of the Lululemon founder Chip Wilson that specializes in a soft, washable, stretchy fabric it calls technical cashmere, laid off about 35 people or 10 percent of the staff at its headquarters in Vancouver, British Columbia, last month. Even Lululemon, the athleisure pioneer, has been struggling with falling profit margins and rising inventory.Theres a lot of wannabes out there creating noise, said Matt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the NPD Group, a market research firm. The shakedowns started. A lot of these brands are going to go away.Few retail and fashion analysts expect that athleisure and active wear, as a category, will stall. Surveys show participation in group fitness and exercise classes is up among young adults in the United States. A cultural shift in the workplace, led by start-ups and other newer companies, has made it more acceptable to wear sneakers, and even sweatpants, to the office.In cities like New York and Los Angeles, spinning classes are starting to replace cocktail bars as after-work hangouts, marketers say. And they say younger shoppers increasingly aspire to the idea of a hip, healthful lifestyle  cold-pressed juice and yoga class, documented and broadcast on Instagram  over a new Coach handbag or MaxMara dress.Retailers have jumped on that trend as a way to inject an edgier, younger, experience-based element into their clothes and accessories, as a lack of decisive fashion hits has depressed sales.Still, the growing athleisure universe makes it harder than ever for brands to stand out. And retailers are finding that the trend does not present a quick or easy fix to their woes.These retailers feel they have to participate, otherwise theyre losing share, said Lupine Skelly, a retail analyst at Wedbush Securities. But theres just a slush of products in the market, and relatively little brand loyalty. How do you differentiate yourself so youre just not competing on price?Gaps experience offers one example. Though Gap does not break out sales for its high-end Athleta activewear, where jogger pants can go for $79, Ms. Skelly says growth has softened. But the retailers less expensive label, Old Navy, has found traction with athletics wear starting at less than $20, a trend mirrored in Gaps core brands.Still, Gaps chief executive, Art Peck, told investors last month that Athleta is right in the sweet spot of the lifestyle trend. That was after a quarter in which companywide comparable sales slid 7 percent from a year earlier, and the company gave a weak outlook for 2016.Even companies that specialize in the athleisure category, like Lululemon, are having to adjust. The company is fighting back against the competition by expanding its mens business and growing globally. The company has said that it intends to open 60 stores this fiscal year, including eight stores each in Europe and Asia, where Lululemon runs just a handful of stores. It has 354 stores worldwide.Nike, meanwhile, has struggled with mounting inventory, aggressively marking down its shoes and hoodies at factory stores and selling to third-party discounters  both steps the athletics wear giant has historically been loath to take.But Trevor Edwards, the Nike brand president, signaled that Nike would double down on athleisure trend. More and more women are blending running, fitness and sports style in their lives, and this shift is fundamental to how this business operates, he said on a call with investors on Tuesday.With such a deluge, can Yogasmoga hope to make a mark?Yes, says Mr. Bali. Yogasmogas shirts and pants are the softest and most durable, made from a line of high-end fabric it calls Aurum, a blend of Lycra and Supplex, a pile-resistant type of nylon. They are made in the United States, allowing Yogasmoga to respond to trends in real time.The company spent two years developing its Carbon 6 black dye for pants Mr. Bali promises will never go see-through, a product mishap that previously plagued Lululemon. And shoppers appreciate Yogasmogas authenticity and commitment to social causes, he said: There is no Photoshopping in any of its ads, and the brand has set up a nonprofit organization that finances womens health, education and microfinance projects in India.Weve put so much love into this, Mr. Bali said. Were not going to be the silly brand nobody remembers in a few years."}
{"text": "Dont obsess about the svelte new iPhone or the price cut for the Apple Watch.Dont worry too much about Apples courtroom battles over privacy and national security, at least not now. Those issues moved to the back burner on Monday when the Justice Department said that it might not need Apples help to break into an iPhone connected to a mass shooting.Instead, if youre interested in Apple as the worlds most valuable company, and not just in Apple as a maker of cool gadgets, the biggest news affecting it lately has arguably come from another quarter: the foreign currency markets.For a reading on where Apples share price may be heading, look to the dollar.The underlying reason is this: The dollars rise and fall have a direct effect on Apples earnings, which ultimately drive share prices. When the dollar strengthens, sales of iPhones abroad are worth less in American currency, hurting profits and, sooner or later, knocking down share prices. When the dollar weakens, on the other hand, those overseas profits become more valuable.Despite a partial recovery over the last few days, the greenback has been weakening and Apples shares have been rising. Apple has been getting a dollar bonus.And whats true for Apple is true for many of the multinationals in the Standard & Poors 500-stock index, which declined last year and fell sharply for much of the start of this one. Corporate profits fell 5.1 percent in 2015, the largest drop since 2008, the Commerce Department said on Friday. Profit margins continue to be pressured, but the turn in the value of the dollar gave earnings a nudge upward, helping American multinationals prosper. It is no accident that the S.&P. 500 began to recover in late January, as the dollar began to weaken.Apple is a case in point. When it reported earnings on Jan. 26, the dollar had been rising for months, and Timothy D. Cook, its chief executive, discussed the repercussions during an earnings call with Wall Street analysts. Two-thirds of Apples revenue is now generated outside the United States, he said, so foreign currency fluctuations have a very meaningful impact on our results.He illustrated that impact this way: Between the last three months of 2014 and the same stretch in 2015, every dollars worth of sales that Apple earned outside the United States lost 15 cents when translated into dollars. In its latest quarter alone, he added, Apple lost six percentage points of sales growth to the rising dollar.The iPhone is the companys profit engine, but the strong dollar chipped away at its power. The average sales price for the iPhone globally at the end of 2015 was $691, according to Luca Maestri, Apples chief financial officer. But he said the strong dollar reduced the effective sales price by $49, or roughly 7 percent.Apples share price, which buoyed the overall stock market in past years, fell 4.6 percent in 2015 and dropped more than 11 percent through Jan. 27. Since, then, though, Apple shares have risen more than 13 percent.The dollars direction has been changing recently as well. On a trade-weighted basis, after gaining more than 9 percent in 2015, it has weakened by nearly 2.5 percent this year. That has helped American companies with significant international earnings, especially technology companies. Within the S.&P. 500 index, half of that sectors earnings come from outside the United States.Compare that with the utility companies in the index: They obtain only 4.4 percent of their earnings abroad. Over the last 12 months, utilities, which pay hefty dividends and have been insulated from the dollars fluctuations, have returned 15.5 percent, compared with 6.6 percent for information technology shares. Since late January, tech shares have nearly kept pace with utilities. The decline in the dollar has helped account for that.Where the dollar heads now is a matter for pure speculation. Clearly, the Federal Reserves shifting monetary policy is important. As John Higgins, chief markets economist for Capital Economics, put it, the Fed appears to have turned more dovish, which has undermined the dollar. In an election year in which the trade deficit is a major issue, you wouldnt be sticking your neck out very far in assuming that the Fed might retain a dovish bias and that the dollar might remain fairly weak.That said, the Fed couldnt entirely control the dollars value, even if it wanted to do so. Foreign exchange rates are determined by traders who compare currencies, many of which have been weakened by their own sputtering local economies and by central banks that have adopted near-zero or negative short-term interest rates. In comparison, the United States may be a bastion of stability, and the dollar could rise.It is quite possible, in short, that the dollars ebb has given companies like Apple only a temporary reprieve. And the dollar is only one ingredient in Apples corporate mix. Other transient factors  the iPhones shape and power, the Apple Watchs price and appearance, and the security of Apples devices  may play a more dominant role in determining Apples fortunes.Obsess about that if you must, but dont underestimate the dollar."}
{"text": "The Islamic State is desperately lashing out in Europe because its base in the Middle East is rapidly eroding, Secretary of State John Kerry said on Friday in Brussels, where he traveled to demonstrate the United States support for Belgium three days after bombs killed 31 people, including at least two Americans.We will not be intimidated, we will not be deterred, Mr. Kerry said, directly addressing Islamic State militants who have struck Paris; Ankara, Turkey; Tunis; San Bernardino, Calif.; and elsewhere. And we will come back with greater resolve, with greater strength, and we will not rest until we have eliminated your nihilistic beliefs and cowardice from the face of this earth.Mr. Kerry, standing next to Prime Minister Charles Michel of Belgium, said that 66 nations, including Belgium, had joined a coalition devoted to fighting the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL.The very reason that Daesh is resorting to actions outside of the Middle East is that its fantasy of a caliphate is collapsing before their eyes, he said, using the Arabic acronym for the organization. Its territory is shrinking every day, its leaders are being decimated, its revenue resources are dwindling, and its fighters are fleeing, he said.Mr. Kerry said that basic decency and humanity were the most effective responses to terrorism. He singled out Dr. Laura Billiet, an American who rushed to a police station after bombs ripped through Brussels Airport, and who immediately set up triage operations, tending to victims with burns and shrapnel wounds, with limited supplies at hand. No statement could be simpler, and yet no statement could really be more powerful, he said.Mr. Kerry confirmed that at least two American citizens were among the dead in Brussels, although their names have not been made public.The United States, I want you to know, is praying and grieving with you for the loved ones of those who have been very cruelly taken from us  including Americans  and for the many who were injured in these despicable attacks, he said.The United States has become keenly attuned to the Islamic States use of social media to disseminate its propaganda, and Mr. Kerry appeared to have carefully calibrated his remarks to appeal to Muslims.Those whose lives were torn apart this week were not combatants in any kind of conflict, he said. They posed no threat. They wished no one any harm. They were simply going about their lives: airport and subway workers; a Peruvian mother of twins who was training to be a chef; an American personal trainer flying home for Easter; an Indian employee of a high-tech firm; Mormon missionaries; public servants; teachers; tourists.He added: Contrast these good people, innocent people, with the twisted killers who planted the bombs, terrorists whose sole aim was to kill and maim and sow fear. There, in the sharpest relief possible, we see in that, the difference between life and death, between decency and evil, and between civilization and those who revel in destruction.Mr. Kerry and Mr. Michel spoke together at the prime ministers residence. Mr. Michel kept his remarks brief, acknowledging that we need to improve the fight against terrorism in Europe and in Belgium.He added: The history between the United States and Europe has been a steady one. Theyve always been side by side. Switching to English, he said, I wish also to express my condolences to the American victims."}
{"text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon   One admirer of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria compared him to Charles de Gaulle, the French leader stubborn and confident enough to defy a more powerful ally, the United States, even after its decisive help against Nazi Germany.His critics offer another analogy: the fable of the scorpion that persuades a frog to carry it across the river, then stings it, drowning both. Russia, having rescued Mr. Assad with its air force, is the frog. Now it is swimming for a political settlement to the Syrian war, hoping to cement its renewed status as a global power  but given Mr. Assads history, he may very well sink the negotiations and explain, as several diplomats put it, that making deals is not in his nature.Ever since President Vladimir V. Putins surprise announcement last week that Russia was scaling back its aerial bombing campaign in Syria, speculation has swirled about whether Mr. Putins next move is to force Mr. Assad to make a substantive political compromise to end the war.But while Mr. Assads dependence on Russias military, money and political influence has only grown during Mr. Putins six-month aerial assault in Syria, the campaign has also bolstered Mr. Assads confidence and ambitions as it has shored up Syrian government forces.Putin apparently thinks Syria needs Russia more than the other way around, said David W. Lesch, an Assad biographer and professor at Trinity University in San Antonio. But Assad and his inner circle probably arrogantly think it is quite the reverse.Mr. Assad inherited the presidency in 2000 from his father, who governed for 30 years. He relies on a small, cohesive ruling coterie, mostly members of his family and security officials. While Mr. Putins withdrawal appeared to take Syrian officials briefly by surprise, they quickly told diplomats that Russian support was undiminished and dismissed any notion that they were under pressure.Bushra Khalil, a Lebanese lawyer who has longstanding contacts with Syrian government insiders and has met several times in recent weeks with senior officials, including the interior minister and a powerful intelligence chief, Ali Mamlouk, described their mood as buoyant.Mr. Assads advisers believe not only that he has passed the risky period and will remain the president of Syria, she said in a recent interview, but also that his ability to stand up to the whole world will make him more prominent than ever as a leader in the region.They insist that Russia is steadfast, she added, but they also hold an insurance card: their even closer relationship with Iran and their ability to juggle two very different allies.They are like a man with two wives, said Ms. Khalil, best known for defending Saddam Hussein in his war crimes trial in Iraq. There is something you like in each one.Ms. Khalil, who compared Mr. Assad to de Gaulle, is a longtime supporter of his, with a flair for flamboyant statements, and her meetings with officials were not about the war but about a court case involving a son of Muammar el-Qaddafi, the deposed Libyan dictator.But her description of the inner circles mood and modus operandi was echoed by many others, both supporters and detractors, who have met with Mr. Assad or his advisers and allies in recent months. They include scholars, humanitarian officials, Syrian associates, diplomats and officials with the pro-government alliance that includes Iran, Russia and Hezbollah. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to preserve their access to government officials or to avoid reprisals.Over and over again in separate interviews, these people described a leadership that is expert in playing allies off one another; often refuses compromise, even when the chips appear to be down; and, if forced to make deals, delays and complicates them, playing for time until Mr. Assads situation improves.Mr. Putin seems bent on capping a triumphant return to the world stage by presiding over a political solution for Syria, hand in hand with the United States. Several diplomats said that Russia defined victory as a negotiated solution that would leave Mr. Assad in power  showing that Western aspirations for regime change had failed  but that Mr. Putin might back a deal that would ease the Syrian leader out later or diminish his power.While Iran appears more attached to keeping Mr. Assad in power, it is becoming clear that without Russian air power, Iranian support is not enough to help Syrian government forces advance, despite thousands of ground troops from Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militias.So Mr. Assad most likely realizes that he has to engage in some kind of political process, at least to satisfy Mr. Putin, said Mr. Lesch, the biographer, who regularly visited Mr. Assad from 2004 to 2009 and has met with high-level Syrian government officials and opposition members since the civil war started in 2011.But the Syrian government could drag out and complicate the process, Mr. Lesch said, and say no 49 times until saying yes on the 50th. He added that Mr. Assad probably figures he can game the system in a way that preserves the existing core in power.Another problem, analysts say, is that Mr. Assad and his father before him deliberately created a system dependent on a single leader, without strong institutions or deputies. Some believe it is so brittle that even the slightest compromise is likely to bring it down  the assessment that led Mr. Assad to crack down on protesters rather than accede to political changes in the first place.Mr. Assad has proved to be the ultimate survivor. He has held on through five years of upheaval, beginning with political protests that seemed to have the momentum of a widespread Arab revolt and American support, and devolving into a proxy war that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced half of Syrias population.His opponents, domestic and international, have time and again underestimated not just Mr. Assads readiness to use violence to preserve his authority, but also the staying power of his inner circle and core loyalist forces.Mohammad al-Shaar, the interior minister, sleeps in a paper-stacked office, still working long hours despite three attempts on his life  a poisoning and two bombs, one of which damaged his right hand  said Ms. Khalil, a longtime friend.Mr. Assads brother-in-law, Asef Shawkat, died in a bombing in 2012 along with three other top security officials; Mr. Assads brother Maher was maimed but remained a powerful general. Yet Mr. Assad still holds meetings in his ceremonial palace overlooking Damascus with only minimal visible security, leading several recent visitors to joke that they could have walked in with a gun.Opponents also miscalculated the willingness of a critical mass of ordinary Syrians, including many who dislike Mr. Assad, to remain quiescent for fear of uncertain alternatives.Mr. Assad excels at running the clock. His officials show up at peace talks but essentially refuse to negotiate. They broadly promise humanitarian aid access while denying the vast majority of specific requests. Mr. Assad agreed in 2013, under threat of United States military action, to destroy Syrias arsenal of chemical weapons, yet conventional attacks on civilian areas, and accusations of chlorine gas use, remain routine.As time passes, the rise of the Islamic State and the refugee crisis spilling into Europe have shifted Western priorities away from Mr. Assads ouster. Washington no longer insists he step down at the beginning of a transition.Mr. Assad and his allies believe that the West has concluded it needs him to control Syrias borders to fight the Islamic State and stem the flow of refugees, said an official with the pro-government alliance.Those who support Mr. Assad are counting, in part, on the fractured nature of the conflict, saying they do not believe Russia will be able to find a set of opposition figures who are both willing to share power with Mr. Assad and are acceptable to all parties.At the same time, Mr. Assad and his circle often test the patience of badly needed allies, according to a Syrian who, while deeply critical of the president, supports the government over the opposition. This Syrian, who speaks often with officials, said the government had tangled with Iran over bills, with Hezbollah over turf and with Russia over military performance.That is nothing new. A diplomat with long experience in the region recounted that in the 1980s, a British diplomat asked the Soviet ambassador about the superpowers relationship with Mr. Assads father, Hafez.They take everything from us, the Soviet said, except advice.Many Syrian officials, steeped in Arab nationalism and often educated in Moscow, feel comfortable with a secular Russia and its emphasis on preserving state institutions. But many also value a theocratic Iran for its commitment to a long fight in Syria and its confrontational policy toward Israel.Several prominent pro-Assad insiders have also sought to woo the United States. But a Western scholar and former official who met Mr. Assad and his advisers last spring said the Syrians demonstrated unrealistic hopes and had failed to grasp how brutal they appeared to Washington.But Western officials who hoped for a split inside the inner circle were also unrealistic, this scholar said. Russias aid has now most likely squelched any fears for their personal fate that could have tempted Mr. Assads closest confidants to leave.Mr. Lesch, the biographer, said that some advisers believed some decentralization of authority was needed, but that it remained to be seen if they can form a critical mass to convince Assad to negotiate seriously."}
{"text": "VERMILLION, S.D.  Visitors to this town of about 11,000 on a bluff near the Missouri River have long been surprised to learn that its home to a set of rare Stradivari stringed instruments, which are housed in a museum here along with the worlds oldest playable harpsichord, the oldest surviving cello and some 15,000 other historic instruments.But this month, visitors to the National Music Museum on the University of South Dakota campus have also found themselves face to face with another seemingly misplaced cultural treasure: a Shakespeare First Folio.The book, on loan from the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, drew a steady stream of visitors last Saturday, including Amy Redhage, who had driven seven hours from Lowden, Iowa, with her five children.I went to Stratford-on-Avon with my high school orchestra, but I dont think we got to see anything like a First Folio, she said with a touch of reverence.Other pilgrims have shown flashes of outright Shakespearemania, like a college student who visited later that afternoon and announced her intention to get a passage from Macbeth tattooed on her side.She stood next to the Folio and tried to keep herself from crying, said Patricia Bornhofen, the museums communications manager, who was keeping watch over the exhibition.The 400th anniversary of Shakespeares death is prompting celebrations around the world. But few efforts are more ambitious than the Folgers efforts to send a fleet of First Folios barnstorming to all 50 states and two territories, including 35 where the book seems to have never been displayed before.This traveling exhibition, First Folio! The Book That Gave Us Shakespeare, will offer a projected 750,000 visitors nationwide an up-close view of one of the enduring monuments of literary history, which is shown open to the page containing Hamlets To be or not to be soliloquy. Published in 1623, seven years after Shakespeares death, the Folio collected 36 of Shakespeares plays (most of his output), 18 of which were unpublished in his lifetime.Without the Folio, we might not have Macbeth or The Tempest or Julius Caesar  a timely reminder, Michael Witmore, the director of the Folger said in a telephone interview, of both the fragility of cultural survival and the power of print.In a moment where information seems to be everywhere, he said, its startling to be reminded that the sole conduit of some of these incredibly influential plays is a physical object made out of rag paper.Great pains are being taken over the handling of those five-pound, 900-page bundles  only 233 of which are known to survive, 82 of them in the Folgers vault in Washington. The library has built precisely sized casing to transport the 18 Folios being cycled into the tour, each of which differs slightly in dimensions, because of rebinding and recutting of the pages over the centuries. The carefully engineered display vitrine collects data on temperature and humidity, which is regularly sent back to Washington.But outside the case, the Folger has encouraged host communities to go crazy, with satellite exhibitions, performances and events that make Shakespeare their own, whether its a jazz funeral in New Orleans or, in Duluth, Minn., a screening of Shakespeare silent movies with live music by the local indie-rock heroes Low.In Vermillion, a two-day symposium, Shakespeare in South Dakota, Past and Present, made the point that the playwright is hardly a new arrival on the Great Plains.Even in territorial days, there were people here who cared about Shakespeare, said Darlene Farabee, a professor of English at the university and the lead organizer for the Folio stop. There just werent a lot of people here.The first outdoor theater in the United States built for performing Shakespeare, Professor Farabee said in a talk, opened in 1915 at Yankton College, 25 miles north of Vermillion. In the early 20th century, the state was also home to several womens Shakespeare Clubs  the forerunner of modern book clubs  like one in Aberdeen, in the states northeast corner, that has been meeting since 1901.The playwright also pops up in the states history in goofier ways. In a presentation on Shakespeare in 19th-century South Dakota newspapers, Chelsea Campbell, a recent graduate of the university, showed slides of several advertisements, including one for Hostetters stomach bitters declaring that nothing ailed Hamlet but indigestion.In the 19th century, Shakespeare was pop culture, Ms. Campbell said. The Folio coming to South Dakota almost feels like things coming full circle.Attendance at the exhibition last Saturday was about 200  big for the museum, if modest compared with the mostly Native American crowd that gathered across campus at the Dakota Dome that evening for the annual University of South Dakota Wacipi, or powwow, which featured hundreds of dancers in colorful traditional regalia.Several speakers at the symposium addressed the question of connecting Shakespeare with Native Americans, who make up roughly 9 percent of the states population.Armik Mirzayan, a professor of linguistics at the university, presented what he said was the first partial Lakota translation of the To be or not to be soliloquy, though he had only gotten through about nine lines so far. (The first challenge: Lakota has some 14 or 15 ways to translate to be, he said.)Jesse Bien, an English teacher at the Flandreau Indian School, 90 miles north of here, talked about the annual Shakespeare festival he started four years ago, where students perform their own 10-minute mini-versions of Shakespeare plays.Shakespeare has been held up as the ultimate symbol of Western cultural imperialism. But Mr. Bien, who is a member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate tribe of South Dakota, said that he saw Shakespeare as empowering for students at Flandreau, which enrolls roughly 300 students with some 40 different tribal affiliations from all over the country.We use Shakespeare as a device to push the students a little further out into the world, Mr. Bien said.On Monday, about 50 students from the school arrived at the museum to start their Shakespeare unit with a visit to the Folio. The last Friday in April, youre going to be onstage performing Romeo and Juliet, so get ready, Mr. Bien told them.Inside, Professor Farabee explained the volumes history and gave an impromptu lesson in Renaissance bookmaking, demonstrating how to fold a sheet of paper once to make a folio, then again into quartos and octavos.Students approached the case to peer at the Folio, in what for some was their first glimpse of Shakespeares written words. It lets you look back in time, said Isabell Leith, a sophomore.After lunch, Professor Farabee led the students in a collective performance of the prologue to Romeo and Juliet, calling them onstage in small groups to shout out pairs of lines in unison.Mr. Bien, who is also the boys basketball coach at Flandreau, drilled one group in iambic pentameter and urged a reluctant Shakespearean to breathe deep into his chest and project.You do it for me all the time on defense, he said. Now I want you to do it for Shakespeare."}
{"text": "After Art Sherman, the 79-year-old trainer of the 2014 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner California Chrome, arrived in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, from Southern California on Monday, he tried his best to sleep, but it was of no use.He wanted to lay eyes on his prized colt, who had been overseas with Shermans son Alan since January in preparation for Saturdays $10 million Dubai World Cup, the worlds richest horse race. So he showered, shaved and headed to Meydan Racecourse.I got up to the barn, and I yelled at him, Sherman said. I said, Hey, Chrome, what are you doing? He kind of looked at me and started making that little noise that he does.Sherman took advantage of their alone time, sitting with him and feeding him the same cookies he has devoured since he was young and remarking on how strong he looked. I said, Either Im getting smaller or hes getting bigger, Sherman said.The consensus in Dubai is that California Chrome, who finished second in last years Dubai World Cup and is this years favorite, looks more powerful than ever at age 5. If he wins on Saturday, California Chrome will become the leading thoroughbred in career earnings, with $12.5 million.I watched him grow into the individual he is, since hes been a 2-year-old, and now hes 5, and I said, Wow, what a big change,  Sherman said. He looks just absolutely terrific and is training great.California Chrome, the shiny chestnut colt with the signature white blaze, charmed rugged horsemen and casual fans alike during a thrilling Triple Crown run that ended with a thud when he finished fourth in the Belmont Stakes after getting banged up coming out of the starting gate. The fairy tale also ended for his Everyman owners, Perry and Denise Martin and Steve and Carolyn Coburn, who had endeared themselves to many when they hit the jackpot with their very first foal. After the Belmont, Coburn ridiculed the connections of the winner, Tonalist, for taking the cowards way out and entering him in only one Triple Crown race.After last years trip to Dubai, California Chrome headed to England for a shot at the Group I Prince of Waless Stakes at Royal Ascot, but he was scratched two days before the race with an injury that was later determined to be a bruised cannon bone. In July, Taylor Made Farm in Kentucky bought the Coburns share in California Chrome, with the intent to stand him at stud in 2017, and helped nurse him back to health. The colt returned to the racetrack in January, winning the Grade II San Pasqual Stakes at Santa Anita Park, and followed that with a victory at Meydan in a prep race for the World Cup.Through all the ups and downs, California Chrome has amassed quite a fan club, whose members call themselves Chromies. Now that club has an international flavor.Hes got a fan base that you cannot believe, all over the world, Sherman said. It is unbelievable. The day he won here, for a prep race, the people here gave him a standing ovation, and I said: Wow. They love this horse. It is cool, and it makes you feel good.During his time in Dubai, California Chrome has routinely come out at 7 a.m. to train, and fans from all over the world gather three or four deep just to catch a glimpse of the 2014 Horse of the Year.The jockey Victor Espinoza, who was able to capture the elusive Triple Crown a year later with American Pharoah, was among California Chromes many fans Thursday. He escorted him to the track, even though he does not ride him in the mornings, and walked him back to the barn when he was finished. He left his side only to do a quick interview with a Russian news outlet.As he did during his Triple Crown run, California Chrome seems to thrive on the attention. He stopped to take in the crowd and pose for the cameras, all while receiving pets from Team Chrome. You know, the horse just loves everybody thats attached to him, Sherman said. He just seems to blossom when theyre around. You have to be there to see it. Youd think, Wow, he looks part human.Also representing the United States in the field of 12 are the Grade I winners Mshawish, Hoppertunity, Keen Ice and Frosted, who is owned by Godolphin, the breeding and racing stable founded by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. Despite being thought of as California Chromes main competition, Frosted has been mostly out of sight, training at Marmoom, Sheikh Mohammeds private training complex on the outskirts of Dubai.Duncan Taylor, president and chief executive of Taylor Made, said he was enjoying the experience and not worrying about the next step for California Chrome, although the ultimate goal is the Breeders Cup Classic in November.It is quite an experience to be over here with all the different countries represented, Taylor said. It really gives you a sense of just how awesome the horse business is, and how many people from all around the world are involved.No matter what happens Saturday, California Chromes fans, from California to Dubai, will celebrate his unusual journey, one that has kept him on the racetrack well beyond the Belmont.Hes got fanfare like Ive never seen for a horse, Sherman said. Ive been around for a long time, and I know American Pharaoh had a great following, but I think the Chromies are different. Its a different group of people  you know what I mean  and hes probably their hero."}
{"text": "Northampton, Mass.  AS they enter the third round of the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament this weekend, the University of Connecticut Huskies have won 71 consecutive games. Seventy-one! And they won national championships in 1995, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014 and 2015  thats 10 times in the last 21 years, and nine times in the last 15. Now, thats major news. Only it isnt  because this is the UConn womens team.Even if this years Huskies win the tournament, the N.C.A.A. will pretty much ignore them, too. Certainly it will neglect them financially. Over at the mens tournament, the N.C.A.A. pays for success: Each game a team plays (not including the championship) earns the teams conference roughly $260,000 this year plus $260,000 each of the five following years. So the total value of a victory in the mens tournament is approximately $1.56 million. By contrast, a win in the womens tournament brings a reward of exactly zero dollars. Thats right, zero dollars.That sends a strong signal that the womens tournament is less significant and less worthy than the mens, and its a policy that perpetuates a historical pattern of discrimination against women in institutions of higher education. The N.C.A.A. needs to start rewarding women for their victories.The federal law Title IX requires equal opportunity for each gender in activities (including athletics) sponsored by institutions of higher education that receive federal funding. But the N.C.A.A., a nonprofit that makes its money from selling television rights, tickets and corporate sponsorships, does not get federal funding and is not considered by the courts to be a state actor. It does not have to follow the rules of Title IX.And it doesnt. The N.C.A.A. used to seriously encourage the compliance of member schools with Title IX and other regulations through a certification process every 10 years  a collaborative effort that involved faculty, students and administrators. But in 2011, an N.C.A.A. board put a moratorium on that certification process. Though the N.C.A.A. has devised a superficial substitute, there are now no adequate gender-equity compliance reviews in college sports.The N.C.A.A. also doesnt protest when its member schools engage in the counting chicanery  unfortunately permissible under federal guidelines  that overstates their numbers of female athletes. Male basketball players who practice with a womens team can be counted as female athletes. Women who run track can be counted as members of three teams: indoor track, outdoor track and cross-country. Female rowing teams sometimes list as many as 100 members, a preposterously high number that is obviously arranged as a Title IX offset to the average squad size of 120 men on Division I football teams.The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education is charged with enforcing Title IX, but it doesnt have enough resources to fully address all the complaints that come in about specific programs, let alone undertake its own compliance reviews of university athletic departments. Without either the N.C.A.A. or the Office for Civil Rights applying adequate pressure, gender equity has lagged in intercollegiate athletics. Last year 57 percent of all college students were female, yet only slightly more than 40 percent of college athletes were women. Over the past decade the number of male athletes in college has increased by 53,317, while the number of female athletes increased by only 44,474.The N.C.A.A.s policy of providing no financial reward for victories in the womens basketball tournament is emblematic of another problem: Athletic administrators and overseers treat college sports like a commercial venture. If men bring in the money, the thinking goes, then men should get the money. (Well, some men  the coaches, conference commissioners and athletic directors, but certainly not the players themselves.)This reasoning is faulty on two levels. First, the mens tournament may have higher ratings and sell more expensive tickets, but the womens tournament is also a moneymaker: It is broadcast by ESPN and sells out many games. Even by conventional commercial standards, the men shouldnt get $1.56 million per victory while the women get nothing.Second, college sports are not supposed to be treated as purely commercial activities. The N.C.A.A. constitution considers college sport an amateur activity with redeeming physical, social and educational value. There is no clause in Title IX that says except if one gender generates more revenue than the other.College sports benefits from preferential fiscal treatment in a variety of forms: no taxes on revenues generated by mens basketball and football, deductibility for individual donations that are required to buy good seats, exemption on interest payments for bonds to pay for stadiums and arenas, no requirement for player payroll taxes or unemployment insurance and so on. College sports programs also receive millions of dollars of subsidies from state governments annually.If intercollegiate athletics, under the auspices of the N.C.A.A., wants to continue to receive such preferential treatment, it has to adhere to the educational goals that it purports to represent. This means equal treatment of men and women in all aspects of the educational experience  including granting financial rewards for their March Madness victories. Go UConn!"}

{"text": "LOUISVILLE, Ky.   The Monkey Wrench, a bar in the Highlands neighborhood here, hosted a March Sadness event Friday night. Fans gathered to watch taped broadcasts of the three games in which the Louisville mens basketball team won national championships, in 1980, 1986 and 2013. Wearing red was required, and, per tradition, the song Mahgeetah by the Louisville band My Morning Jacket was played after victory was secured.I guess were going to play Mahgeetah three times, said the owner of the Monkey Wrench, Dennie Humphrey, because were going to win all three of these games.The somber get-together was a welcome distraction. The most college-hoops-mad city in the country  Louisville is routinely the top market when it comes to television ratings  is hosting the N.C.A.A. tournaments South Regional this week in the same year its favorite teams season was cut short by a scandal unsavory even by the low standards of big-time college sports.Louisville self-imposed a postseason ban in February in connection with an N.C.A.A. investigation into accusations that a former basketball staff member had paid prostitutes to entertain players and recruits in university housing. The charges, which have reportedly resulted in a criminal inquiry, have aggravated unrelated controversies involving the universitys administration.Adding insult to injury, Louisville, under Coach Rick Pitino, was terrific this season, finishing 23-8 and No. 14 in the Associated Press poll after the regular season. Its two seniors were transfers from less accomplished programs who said they had wanted to play in just one N.C.A.A. tournament.If Humphrey was on one part of the Kbler-Ross spectrum of grief, Larry Benz, the chairman of the University of Louisvilles board of trustees, described the citys mood this week as elsewhere: Theres a lot of ennui.Though the Cardinals would not have been eligible to play tournament games in their home arena, KFC Yum Center, locals still have experienced the indignity of four foreign fan bases coming to cheer their own. Outside the arena on Thursday night, the fans wearing red were there to back Maryland.For a city that prides itself on a few distinctive, idiosyncratic features  chiefly bluegrass, bourbon, basketball and an annual horse race  the circumstances have been as hurtful as the home teams postseason absence.There is a little-brother component to the city, said Aaron Yarmuth, executive editor of the alternative newspaper LEO Weekly. We want to be mentioned with Austin, Portland, Nashville.If Louisville the city can feel overlooked in favor of more prominent islands in the hipster archipelago dotting the country, Louisville the basketball program has its own overshadowing rival much closer to home: the Kentucky Wildcats. Kentuckys mens program has the most Division I wins in history, and a fan base that will not let anyone around here forget it.This was the first time in nine seasons that neither Louisville nor Kentucky had made the N.C.A.A. tournaments second weekend, and Kentucky was the one with the better excuse: It lost.A lot of fans are as equally relieved that the archrival is out of the tournament, Benz said. To prove his point, he noted that many residents of this city just across the Ohio River from Indiana give their secondary allegiance to the Hoosiers, who eliminated Kentucky last Sunday.Even so, the Louisville scandals unsavory nature and the accusation that it involved cheating in recruiting has caused soul-searching among Cardinals fans. They had felt that between their program and Kentuckys  whose coach, John Calipari, has had Final Four runs at two of his previous stops vacated by the N.C.A.A.  theirs was the clean one.Since Cal got there, there has been a sense that we did it the right way, Yarmuth said, adding, Now we dont have that to stand on.Pitino has denied involvement in, and knowledge of, the parties, which were said to have been arranged by a former Louisville staff member and player, Andre McGee. Many people here expect Pitino to survive the scandal. Instead, anger over the mess has flared out in multiple directions, with the N.C.A.A. an obvious target of Louisville fans.I feel frustrated, Henry Hopson, a Louisville fan, said at a bar around the corner from the arena Thursday night. The players involved were not around. Its like putting you on trial for your grandfather.Many have also tired of James Ramsey, the university president since 2002. Ramsey has been accused of misallocating funds and inappropriately drawing additional compensation from other sources, and he caused a stir last Halloween when a picture surfaced of him and his staff members dressed in Mexican outfits, complete with sombreros (he later apologized).James Ramsey hasnt been the most-liked person here lately, said Andrew Peterson, a senior at Louisville who comes from a town about 40 miles south of the city.Part of the reason is that it was Ramsey who made the ultimate decision to self-impose the ban, a pragmatic move even though the optics  a university pulling the rug out from underneath its players in the middle of the season  were less than optimal.Feels like U of L cares about the university, not the students and the team, another fan, Craig Shively, said.So this week, the big screen at Fourth Street Live, a blocklong complex of bars and restaurants downtown, would not be showing a Louisville game. Proprietors would not benefit from the extra income that comes with a Cardinals postseason run. The program and the community would have to wait until next year.The devastation of this year was really like taking your girlfriend away or something, said Humphrey, the bar owner, as he continued preparations for Fridays March Sadness therapy session.Others were more stoic. Rick Streicher showed up at a different bar near the arena Thursday night wearing several pieces of Louisville gear.What do you think Im going to wear? he said, going on to refer to one of the teams playing Saturday night. Villanova?"}
{"text": "Just in time for the start of spring, an icy blast poured from the stage at the Miller Theater on Thursday evening: Schnee had returned to New York.Completed in 2008, this hourlong work by Hans Abrahamsen, an ingenious set of five pairs of complex canons for nine instruments, has been embraced for its pervasive, persuasive chill and fierce details. It ushered in a period of mature mastery for Mr. Abrahamsen, whose rapt recent song cycle, let me tell you, won the prestigious Grawemeyer Award in the fall.Sounding delicate yet tenacious, members of Ensemble Signal, conducted by Brad Lubman, performed Schnee (German for snow) on Thursday as part of the Millers Composer Portraits series. Live, it is a grittier piece than it is on a 2009 recording, the sense of opposing groups within a larger ensemble more ominous. The works beginning here was ethereal yet stabbing, the way flurries feel on skin.Mr. Abrahamsen, his mode sometimes furious blizzards of notes and sometimes unsteady repetitions, handles his unusual complement  two pianos; a percussionist, whose sounds are largely rustles and quiet bells; a trio of strings; and a trio of winds  with skill. There are alluring textural contrasts (papery/liquid, hard/soft); at one point in the beautiful third pair of canons, the strings play drooping chords as the clarinets line accompanies, spare and doleful.Schnee sleds slowly downhill: The canons keep getting shorter  the final two are just a minute each  and the instruments gradually tune themselves downward. (Mr. Abrahamsen ingeniously designates these three tuning episodes as intermezzos.)Frigidity has been a preoccupation of Mr. Abrahamsens, from early works to let me tell you, the final section of which dwells on falling snow. He promised, in a recent interview, to move on from winter.But first, we can look forward to his coming first opera, The Snow Queen, based on the Hans Christian Andersen tale. Finally, a Frozen for grown-ups."}
{"text": "CHICAGO   A typical road game in the Atlantic Coast Conference can build a steely resilience for teams that regularly travel that circuit. A good squad must weather raucous arenas in places like Durham and Chapel Hill, in North Carolina, in order to prosper. Virginia has certainly done that.The No. 1-seeded Cavaliers (29-7) were one of the A.C.C.s best teams this season, and when they took the floor on Friday, they were prepared to be the unpopular road team, even wearing white uniforms.Normally, crowds in the later rounds of the N.C.A.A. tournament are not so one-sided. But United Center, home of Chicagos Bulls and Blackhawks, was overrun with the cardinal and gold colors of Iowa State fans, who had made the five-hour drive up from the universitys campus in Ames.They cheered and exhorted the No. 4-seeded Cyclones (23-12) with deafening roars at times, but aside from a few isolated moments, Virginia was unmoved. The Cavaliers cruised to an 84-71 victory in the Midwest Regional semifinal.Virginia, which advanced to its second regional final in three years, will play Syracuse, which defeated Gonzaga, 63-60, on Friday.The Cavaliers are seeking their first appearance in the Final Four since 1984. That team, led by Rick Carlisle and featuring Olden Polynice and Othell Wilson, lost to Hakeem Olajuwon and Houston in the semifinal.These Cavaliers look motivated to match their forebears. With their so-called pack line defense and their strong inside game, the Cavaliers never trailed on Friday.Iowa States last, best charge came with 6 minutes 6 seconds left, when Deonte Burton hit a 3-pointer, pulling the Cyclones to 68-58 behind. But Virginia pulled away after that, to the dismay of the heavily partisan crowd.It was like a home game for them more than anything, said the Virginia senior guard Malcolm Brogdon. But thats something that fires us up as competitors. We got to the point where we were playing well during away games towards the end of A.C.C. play, so we embraced it. It was a challenge, and we were able to overcome it.Anthony Gill led the Cavaliers with 23 points and 8 rebounds, Mike Toby had 18 points on 8-for-12 shooting, and London Perrantes added nine assists, controlling the tempo virtually throughout. Georges Niang, the 6-foot-8 senior guard from Methuen, Mass., had 30 points and 8 rebounds for the Cyclones, and left the floor with 25 seconds left in the game to a standing ovation and a hug from Coach Steve Prohm.My teammates did a good job of encouraging me, said Niang, who was saddled with four fouls, and Im just bummed that we couldnt continue this run.The Cavaliers can. But before they even left their hotel for the United Center on Friday, Bennett spent a few minutes with his father, Dick Bennett, the highly respected former college basketball coach.The elder Bennett, who coached his son at Wisconsin-Green Bay and is considered the architect of the pack-line defense, reflected on how the day before had been the 20th anniversary of his own fathers death.That prompted Tony Bennett to ask his father what his grandfather would have said before such a big game. Bennett noted that his fathers father, a steelworker from Pittsburgh, had not been highly educated, but had been full of wisdom, nonetheless.You know what your grandfather would tell you? Tony Bennett recalled. Hed tell you: Dont tiptoe into this one. No tiptoeing. I shared that with our guys. I said, Do not tiptoe in this game, and I shared that story, and that meant a lot, because you have to go into these games. You cant tiptoe.With those words in their ears, Virginia stormed out in the first half, shot 60.7 percent shooting from the field (17 for 28), and seized control of the game. The Cavaliers protected a double-digit lead through much of the game. Perrantes, Virginias junior point guard, led the way in the half with seven of his assists, including a handful of picturesque passes to his big men.Late in the half Niang began to show life. He finished the half with 15 points and had a chance to draw the Cyclones to within a dozen points going into intermission. With the clock running down, he took the ball on the right wing and made a forceful drive to the basket, directly in front of the Virginia bench. But Gill slid over and swatted the ball out of bounds at the buzzer.It gave momentum back to Virginia and quieted the many Iowa State fans, and not for the last time.Today was probably three quarters Cyclone fans, Prohm said, and youre disappointed for them. Youre obviously more disappointed for your players, but youre disappointed for every part of Cyclone Nation and Iowa State today.SYRACUSE 63, GONZAGA 60 Syracuse shot just 31 percent from the field in the first half (9 for 29), and Gonzaga built an 11-point lead, but the 10th-seeded Orange (22-13) shot their way back and managed to prevail in the final seconds in their improbable run to the round of 8. Michael Gbinije scored 20 points for Syracuse, including the go-ahead basket with just over 20 seconds to play.Kyle Wiltjer scored 23 for 11th-seeded Gonzaga (28-8), and Domantas Sabonis, the son of the former N.B.A. center Arvydas Sabonis, grabbed 17 rebounds for the Bulldogs.Gonzaga led by 9 (57-48) with6:30to play, but Syracuse finished the game with a 15-3 run.The next fight will be between Syracuse and Virginia, two orange-themed A.C.C. programs.I know them; thats the problem, Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim said. They know us, and we know them, and what I know about them, I dont like. Theyve got a great team. Im going to try not to think about that for another 10 or 15 minutes.On Friday night, with only 88 seconds remaining and Gonzaga leading by 2, Syracuse forced a 10-second violation but missed its ensuing shot. Sabonis missed a layup at the other end, and Syracuse grabbed the rebound and pushed the ball up the floor, where Gbinije scored on a follow-up layup with 21 seconds remaining to give Syracuse a 61-60 advantage.After a timeout, Gonzaga inbounded with 19.8 seconds to play. Following a scramble, Trevor Cooney appeared to have stolen the ball, but he was ruled to have stepped out of bounds. The referees reviewed the play and upheld the call.With two seconds left, the freshman guard Josh Perkins drove the lane, but Tyler Lydon blocked the shot, grabbed the loose ball and was fouled. He hit both free throws, Saboniss heave at the end missed the mark, and the Orange were left to celebrate.Few expected Syracuse to advance as far as it has, but Lydon said the Oranges run should not be considered a fluke.Weve been confident the whole year, he said. We believe in our ability and weve just come together as a team."}
{"text": "With a face as creased as a walnut shell and a smile as gleeful as it was toothless, 98-year-old Augustina Lamagril welcomed us into the small shop inside her adobe home. Rickety wooden shelves were stocked with sardines, cigarettes, beer, soda, kitchen utensils, light bulbs and other household goods. Beneath posters of the Virgin Mary and baby Jesus, two metal-framed beds were heaped with blankets. From the ceiling  rice sacks that had been stapled together  the corpses of hummingbirds dangled from strings, drying.In addition to being one of the few storekeepers in the village of Chaunaca, Augustina is one of the most highly regarded curanderas, or traditional healers, in the Cordillera de los Frailes, a serrated sub-range of the Andes in south-central Bolivia. Despite her remote location, the ill and the injured make their way to her door, traveling for hours or even days to get there. The dead birds were part of her natural pharmacy.My girlfriend, Kelly; our 9-year-old son, Luke; and I, along with our guide and translator, Rogelio Mamani, were invited to sit on low stools. As a black and white cat padded around our feet, Augustina explained the uses of the plants and animal parts that she kept around the house. Speaking in Quechua, she said aloe was good for throat problems; rosemary could heal bones; rue was prescribed when the wind makes you sick. She held out an enamel pot half-full with beige powder  a combination of black corn, barley, wild herbs, frog and owl parts and bat blood. Three drops of bat blood, she said, can cure heart problems.None of us required treatment, so we left the shop with bottles of water, a wool hat knit by Augustina, and a sense that wed been very lucky to have had this encounter with a master of the old ways.Chaunaca is on a well-established trekking route through the Cordillera de los Frailes, a jumbled geologic mass that rises just west of Sucre, Bolivias official capital, best known for its whitewashed Spanish colonial neighborhoods and universities. Though the edge of the mountains can be reached from the city in about an hour, the villages within them feel worlds away.The scenery would have been enough to draw me to the cordillera, with its upthrust layers of multicolored sedimentary rock set around a crater thats encircled by rugged river canyons. But I was equally intrigued by the indigenous Jalqa people who live there and who are known for intricate weavings that represent a fantastical underworld filled with spirits and mythical animals. In the same way that a place like Varanasi exudes a distinctly Hindu aura, and Cairo is palpably Islamic, I wondered how it would feel to be in a place where the culture is strongly associated with strange, subterranean dreamscapes.Though Ive trekked alone in remote regions around the world, I decided to go into the cordillera with a guide. If I hoped to talk to local people, I would need help from someone fluent in Quechua, the areas native language. Additionally, I had heard that some Jalqa were extremely reluctant to be photographed (I met one French couple who had stones thrown at them when they aimed their cameras at people), and I figured I would have a better chance of shooting pictures without upsetting anyone if I was accompanied by a guide who had local connections. It also sounded as if walking the entire route with a backpack would be a daunting prospect for a 9-year-old, so I wanted vehicle support.When I asked around about trekking companies in Sucre, travelers and locals alike pointed me in the same direction: Condor Trekkers. Their guides were reputed to be top-notch, and the companys profits support projects in the cordillera communities. To me, this meant that not only would my money be helping the villagers, but that the guides were likely to have positive relationships with them.I found the Condor Trekkers office inside the Condor Cafe, a restaurant run by the by the same nonprofit that is a magnet for travelers to Sucre, thanks to its cheap and delicious vegetarian food. There, I met the director, Alan Flores. After he described the standard two-, three- and four-day treks that Condor offers, we decided that none of them were right for us. With typical days involving eight or nine hours of strenuous hiking, Alan agreed that it would be no fun for my son. Additionally, I wanted to add an extra day to the four-day itinerary, so we could stay two nights in one place.Alan said it would be no problem  just a bit more expensive  to be accompanied by a vehicle, reducing our hiking to about three or four hours a day and eliminating the need to carry our backpacks.In early November, Rogelio met us at our hostel in Sucre, along with our driver, Luis Ibarra, known as Lucho, who was behind the wheel of a green Mitsubishi Montero. Rogelio was born in a village in the cordillera, and is Jalqa himself. He was studying tourism, English and French in Sucre, and was Condors most experienced guide, having been with the company since it started in 2008.Before we hit the trail, we stopped at a roadside stand to pick up bags of coca leaves. A mild natural stimulant thats normally chewed or brewed as tea, and from which cocaine is derived, its considered to be a gift from the Inca sun god, Inti, and is the essential social currency of the region. With coca, anything is possible, Rogelio said.We turned off the highway and followed a dirt road into the mountains, through pungent groves of pine and eucalyptus, until we reached a place called Chataquila, where a church sits atop the eastern ridge of the cordillera, at 11,800 feet above sea level. It was there, in 1781, that Tomas Katari, the leader of an indigenous rebellion against Spanish rule, was executed, adding to the spiritual and emotional potency of an important place of pilgrimage.Local people flock there in August to make offerings of coca leaves, incense and alcohol to Pachamama  mother earth, in Andean religions  in a shrine dedicated to the Virgin Mary. We believe that if you feed Pachamama, she will feed you, Rogelio explained.From there, we began hiking into the heart of the cordillera, down the so-called Inca Trail, which is believed to have been built about 550 years ago (though may be much older) and was used during pre-Hispanic times for communication and trade. Paved with smooth stones, it descends some 2,300 feet, switchbacking down rocky slopes speckled with cactuses and shrubby trees, into the Rio Ravelo canyon. Skies were sunny, and temperatures were in the upper 70s.In two hours, we reached Chaunaca. A patchwork of fields  some blanketed with purple potato flowers, others sprouting young corn stalks, and many barren and brown, waiting to be planted  terraced the hills and spread out on a plateau that overlooked the river about 25 feet below. Most of the villagers were campesinos, working small family plots, perhaps keeping goats and sheep along with rabbits, guinea pigs and cows.After lunch at a nearby waterfall and an exploration of the grounds of a magnificently derelict adobe hacienda once owned by the 26th president of Bolivia, Gregorio Pacheco, we checked on a new project that Condor Trekkers was funding. Three men were trying to hoist one end of a black polyethylene pipe from the riverbank up to the plateau. Their goal was to span the canyon with a drinking water line that would run from the main village to households across the gorge. The families over there haul their water from the river, and sometimes it makes them sick, said Benigno Romero, one of the workers, who also happened to be Chaunacas mayor.Condor bought the materials and the village supplied volunteer labor; other crews would dig a trench to the villages main well and lay the pipe to the homes that needed water. Mr. Romero explained that being mayor was also an unpaid position, and that he saw it as a privilege. Jalqa people, he said, work together for the good of the whole, and would not expect payment for doing so. It was just part of life.We spent the night in a community-run tourist cabana, several of which have been built in villages in the cordillera. All are variations on a theme: whitewashed stone walls, ceilings of wood and bamboo, liberal amounts of dust and dirt, and bathrooms with a variety of plumbing problems, but comfortable enough, and equipped with simple kitchens. Rogelio proved to be an enthusiastic and talented cook, improvising recipes around pasta, potatoes or quinoa.The next day, a combination of hiking and driving brought us to the village of Potolo, set in an undulating, Martian-red landscape at the base of a sharply hewed massif. One of the largest towns in the cordillera, Potolo is well-known for the weavings that women produce there.Jalqa weavings, called axsus, are made from sheep wool dyed black and red. In fact, the word Jalqa means two colors, in reference to this distinctive palette. Few details are known about the evolution of Jalqa weaving over the ages, but its clear that it was first used to decorate clothing before the idea of making tapestries took hold in the 1990s, when a Sucre-based nonprofit called Anthropologists of the Southern Andes (ASUR) began a program to revitalize Jalqa textile traditions, which were on the verge of disappearing. Its also known that, over the last few centuries, ancient geometric patterns were supplanted by representations of a psychedelic spiritual underworld called Ukhu Pacha.Swirling chaotically across the tapestries, animals with wildly exaggerated features are shown alongside mythical creatures called khurus, which include hunchback dragons and griffin-like bird-things. Within larger animals, smaller animals  called uas, or offspring  are woven, but earthly laws of biology dont apply: Condors can give birth to cats, monsters can give birth to men.According to the anthropologist Veronica Cereceda, the founder of ASUR, the Jalqa believe that Ukhu Pacha is the locus of the worlds primordial creative energy, a space of constant gestation of life, which may stay in the underworld, or emerge into the surface world (Kay Pacha) or the sky (Janaq Pacha).The ruler of Ukhu Pacha, who is often woven into the axsus, is a powerful spirit called Saxra or Supay. Often equated with the devil because of the location of his realm, Saxra is not evil, though he does have demonic aspects, derived in part from the fusion of Catholic ideas of hell with ancient Andean beliefs. If Saxra goes unappeased, he may kidnap people and bring them down to the underworld or cause mining accidents or other disasters. If the proper offerings are made  typically coca, liquor and cigarettes  Saxra can show people where to find silver and gold.Though the underworld is a ubiquitous feature of the indigenous Andean cosmovision, the Jalqa are the only people in Bolivia who depict it in their art. I was curious to talk to some of the weavers, so Rogelio led us to the homes of a few, including Juliana Choque, who looked to be about 30. She set her simple loom up against the wall of her adobe courtyard and began weaving finely spun yarn through the strands of the warp, adding to an axsu that was nearly finished. Ukha Pacha was taking shape before our eyes, and the effect was magical.Juliana said that she had been taught to weave when she was 9 by her mother, who had learned her craft in workshops organized by ASUR in the early 1990s. While the motifs she works with are traditional, each design is unique, a product of her imagination.Like other weavers I spoke with on the trip, Juliana said that, for her, weaving is not a spiritual act, its a purely artistic, and economic, one. Theres little doubt that the resurgence in Jalqa weaving in recent decades owes much to the money that women earn from it.If youre interested in buying any weavings, as we did from Juliana (paying 900 Bolivianos  about $132  for a medium-size piece), visit shops in Sucre before heading to the cordillera, to get a sense of what high-quality work and fair prices look like. A nonprofit cooperative of indigenous weavers called Inca Pallay runs a shop a block off Sucres main plaza, offering Jalqa axsus and other regional textiles, as does the shop at ASURs excellent Museo de Arte Indigena.After a night at Potolos tourist cabana, we set off for the village of Maragua, driving, then walking, then driving again. We hiked past dinosaur footprints, laid down some 65 million years ago by sharp-toed carnivores and round-soled herbivores, and Luke thrust his hands into the tracks with wonder.It wasnt hard to picture dinosaurs in the surrealistic setting that we were trekking through, with its layers of purple and green rock and oddly shaped boulders that seemed to have fallen from the sky. Even a khuru wouldnt have seemed out of place, and the Jalqas say that they may be seen when one is alone in a mountain mist, or in the crepuscular light of dusk or dawn.To reach Maragua, a small farming community, we climbed to the top of a ridge, then dropped down into a bowl-like crater formed by an unusual combination of geologic uplift and erosion. Garnet-colored earth covers the floor of the crater, which is ringed by pale chartreuse walls with arched tops that resemble a series of massive flower petals  imagine a giant greenish-yellow daisy with a dark red center.Since we had planned our extra day for Maragua, we had time to explore and visit with locals, including a self-taught historian named Crispin Ventura. In the modest museum that he runs in an adobe shed, he explained that since Maragua is set inside a crater, its thought to have a special association with the underworld, and he told tales of people whod had encounters with Saxra and the khurus. With these legends fresh in my mind, it was easy to imagine that a nearby cave, the Garganta del Diablo (Devils Throat), which looks like an open, toothy mouth, might actually swallow anyone foolish enough to sleep there.Rogelio also introduced us to the more earthly side of life in Maragua. We had breakfast at the home of Victoria Cruz, who taught Luke how to make buuelos  Bolivian doughnuts  over a fire in a soot-covered, chimney-less room.Later, we helped a family plant its potato crop. Following a pair of bullocks that pulled a wooden plow, a couple of the women dropped seed potatoes in the furrows, which the rest of us covered with manure. Though they had never worked their fields with foreign travelers, we quickly settled into a comfortable rapport and, as soon as Rogelio told them that he would bring them prints of my pictures, they were happy to be photographed.We took several breaks to reload our cheeks with coca and to drink chicha, sprinkling fermented corn alcohol over the ground as an offering to Pachamama. It seemed as if our gifts had been received: A pregnant spider scurrying over a freshly planted row was seen as a sign of fertility, and an omen of a good harvest.The best time to visit the Cordillera de los Frailes is during the dry season, from late April to mid-November.Condor Trekkers can be reached by email (condortrekkers@gmail.com, condortrekkers.org); phone (591-728-91740); or in person at Condor Cafe, 102 Calle Calvo, in Sucre, Bolivia.Standard two, three and four-day treks cost from 500 to 750 bolivianos ($70 to $113) per person, which includes food, guide, lodging and transportation. For our customized five-day trek with vehicle support, we paid 1,400 bolivianos per person.Staying in Sucre, we liked La Dolce Vita (dolcevitasucre.com), where room rates range from 60 to 210 bolivianos.Tourist cabanas, for visitors without a guide, are 60 bolivianos a night per person."}
{"text": "MOSCOW  An error by a crew member committed during adverse weather conditions may have been responsible for the crash of a passenger jet last week in the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don that killed 62 people, a report broadcast by Russian state television said.The Rossiya-1 television channel said late Friday that it had obtained a transcript of the pilot interactions a minute before the FlyDubai passenger jet nose-dived to the ground, killing all the passengers and crew members onboard. A source in the investigative commission with access to flight recorders provided the channel with the transcript.The channel emphasized that its interpretation of the transcript could not be considered the official version of what had happened.Flying from Dubai, the plane was not able to land on its first attempt because of heavy rain and wind, and it entered a holding pattern for two hours. On the second landing attempt, the crew decided to pull up and try again, but 40 seconds after beginning the ascent, one of the pilots switched off the autopilot, possibly in response to sudden turbulence, the report said. Seconds after the autopilot was turned off, the plane plunged to the ground.Dont worry, one of the pilots says, according to the transcript, which was translated into Russian, seconds before saying, Dont do that! The last words recorded were repeated calls to Pull up! Only inhuman screams could be heard for the last six seconds.The television channel cited experts who suggested that by turning off the autopilot, the pilots were trying to pull the plane back to a horizontal position. But at that moment a stabilizing fin at the jets tail was switched on.With the fin activated, the elevator is no longer working and the plane practically does not react to the pilots control panel, the report said. The channel suggested that the pilot could have accidentally hit the button that activated the fin because of his reported chronic fatigue.Russian investigators have opened a criminal inquiry into the crash. On Thursday, the investigative commission said that the flight recorders were in good condition and were being deciphered. The first preliminary reports of the commission could be made public within the next two weeks, they said."}

But that doesnt mean her relatives in India want her (or for that matter her aunt Neela, whos like a sister to Lakshmi) to cook for them. To this day, she writes in her memoir, Love, Loss, and What We Ate  new at No.14 on the hardcover nonfiction list  the elder women of my household in Chennai still regard Neela or me with suspicion whenever we enter the kitchen to make anything other than tea.Most of the buzz so far about this book has centered on Lakshmis ill-fated marriage to Salman Rushdie. And no wonder: Those two were tabloid fodder almost from the moment they met, near the turn of the millennium, when Rushdie was a glamorous international fugitive still married to his third wife (with whom he had recently had a child) and Lakshmi was an aspiring model and actress in her 20s. She was both besotted and intimidated by his writerly circle: I loved talking about books, she notes, but I was in constant fear that my English-lit-class knowledge would extinguish itself midsentence. That insecurity may explain why Lakshmi avoids real literary discussion in this book  its hard to know what she thinks of Rushdies novels or even whether shes read them. But shes unsparing about other aspects of their marriage, which ended in 2007 as a result (she says) of his sexual and emotional neediness. My husband argued with the same lethal eloquence he had used to woo me, she writes. I dont doubt he loved me. Nor do I doubt that what seemed like a desire for me was also in part a desire for what I provided  an adoring audience.Pudding Head: Mark Leyner (whose new novel, Gone With the Mind, will be reviewed in the March 27 issue) has never hit the fiction list.

(because all embryos start out female) and Why Do Men Fall Asleep After Sex? (because the hormones released during orgasm induce drowsiness, and we all know who orgasms more frequently). He also wrote, for O magazine, one of the stranger odes to pudding youre likely to encounter.

{"text": "LOS ANGELES   Within hours of ditching 70 pounds of cocaine at a security checkpoint and bolting barefoot out of the main Los Angeles airport, an off-duty flight attendant was flying across the country after clearing security at the same airport, law enforcement officials say.The flight attendant, Marsha Gay Reynolds, simply used an airline badge with her real name to board another flight the next morning at one of the nations busiest airports, officials said.Communication lapses, bureaucratic complications and special security privileges afforded airline workers all contributed to Ms. Reynoldss ability to remain out of the grasp of law enforcement authorities until she surrendered four days later at Kennedy Airport in New York.This is a security breakdown, said Marshall McClain, president of the union representing Los Angeles airport police officers. That could have easily been an explosive device and a terrorist running from the checkpoint. And we wouldnt have known until it went boom. Ms. Reynolds, 31, who was a flight attendant for JetBlue, was off duty when she arrived March 18 at a security checkpoint at the Los Angeles airport, wearing jeans and a black suit jacket and carrying her known crew member badge, according to an F.B.I. affidavit filed in support of the charge against her.When she was chosen for a random security screening, Transportation Security Administration officers reported, she became nervous and made a phone call in a foreign language before she dropped her bags, kicked off her shoes, ran down an upward-moving escalator and out of the airport, the affidavit said.Airport police officers found 11 packages of cocaine wrapped in green cellophane inside one of the bags Ms. Reynolds left behind, the affidavit said. The drugs had an estimated street value of up to $3 million.Employee badges allow airline workers to get through security faster to reduce lines and allow T.S.A. agents to focus on travelers. To obtain the badges, airline workers must submit to a background check that includes fingerprinting.Crew members do not have to be wearing uniforms or have a boarding pass when using the badges. But they are still subject to random screenings.The fact that Ms. Reynolds was able to fly so soon after her mad dash through the airport did not particularly surprise Jeff Price, an aviation expert, who said the system is designed to catch terrorists, not criminals.The involvement of the crew member badge might cause the T.S.A. to look at this program a little more closely, to see if this is going to be a problem from a terrorist perspective, Mr. Price said.Mr. McClain said the case came amid long-held fears about the threat of a terrorist gaining special access to airports and planes using the crew member program or about people who become radicalized after obtaining such access.The T.S.A. has said that full screening of all employees would cost too much. Instead, the agency has urged airports to increase random screenings of workers and to keep background checks up to date.No bulletin for Ms. Reynoldss arrest was immediately issued. The T.S.A. would not have flagged her name because she did not pose a terrorist threat, according to an airport security official with knowledge of the investigation.The Drug Enforcement Administration did not learn about the drugs until at least five hours after Ms. Reynolds fled and did not know her name until well after she had boarded a flight to her home in New York, according to a federal law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation.A T.S.A. spokesman, Mike England, said in a statement that the agency immediately notified and began working with local law enforcement to identify the individual.Following events such as this, we conduct a full review of our procedures to determine how best to improve upon an already strong security foundation, he said.The T.S.A. did not verify Ms. Reynoldss name until at least Saturday because no one at the airport is allowed access to the database that recorded the scan of her crew member badge, airport security and federal officials said.As a result, T.S.A. officials are recommending that someone with access to the database be required to be at airports across the country, an airport security official said. The agency declined to provide details about the crew member program, citing the investigation.Mr. Price confirmed that no one at airports can get into the database. He said the information went to a remote location. And he said he doubted that anybody was staffing that location on a 24-hour basis, simply because it is rare for anyone to need access to the database. If a crew member is turned away after a badge is scanned, that person could just go through a regular security screening, he said.Ms. Reynolds, a former Jamaican beauty queen and New York University track athlete, faces at least 10 years in prison if convicted of the federal drug charge against her.A spokesman for her family, Allan Jennings, said she may not have been fully aware of what was in the bags.On Friday, a judge in New York City ordered that Ms. Reynolds be returned to Los Angeles. She will remain in custody at least until an April 7 hearing."}
{"text": "I have a 6-year-old daughter who is very pretty. She didnt get her looks from her father or me, and we would find her beautiful no matter what. But people we meet love to point out how gorgeous and stunning she is. I worry that she may begin to internalize the message that her looks are her most important attribute. But saying, Shes really smart, too, seems like a bragging response to a compliment. And I dont want to chastise people who mean well. Any thoughts?ANONYMOUSWell, I Facebook-stalked your family (from the info on your note), and the bad news is that your daughter is pretty adorable. I also have enough experience on the playground to know that little boys are disproportionately asked what they like to do, while girls are more often reduced to their clothes or hair or general prettiness. So I share your concern.For starters, acknowledge the compliments in the friendly spirit in which they were given. A smile and thanks will do fine. Better to make this a teachable moment for your daughter than for clueless adults who think its O.K. to walk around commenting on peoples looks. Whats more, I know many adult women who still feel traumatized by their mothers scrutiny of their appearance as girls. Who knows how a 6-year-old would hear her mothers quibbling with a stranger over her prettiness?Then take one more step. You know, were lucky, because Janie is also very kind (or  good at math, or whatever quality you want to emphasize). I dont think that sounds like a braggadocio. Most people will understand that you are only compensating for their statement about her gorgeousness. But even if they dont, its more important to give your daughter a compass thats based on character and deeds than a looking glass that requires a constant stream of external adoration. Just take a peek at the selfie-loving Kardashian culture: When we need validation from others, theres never enough.I have a friend who works in the arts. I have donated to a few of her projects and charities. Recently, I received an email from her  asking not for a contribution but for the names of 20 friends who might be willing to back her latest art project. I am uncomfortable with this request. It seems pushy and intrusive. But how do I refuse her without hurting her feelings? (She has already sent a follow-up note.)C.A., New YorkAs the late Nancy Reagan warned us would-be tokers in the  80s: Just say no! Being a good friend does not entail falling in line with every request. Some pals, left unchecked, will solicit us (for their favorite museum or medical research or childrens travel soccer team) until we land in debtors prison. I dont blame them for their exuberance. It is probably not the meek but the pushy who will inherit the earth.To minimize hurt feelings here, I would pick up the phone. Say: You know I am a supporter of your work, but I dont feel comfortable sharing the names of friends for you to solicit. It seems like a violation of their privacy. If she disagrees, just repeat gently, Im sorry, I cant. If calling her strikes you as too uncomfortable, try a note. But an email (even one that you think is warmly written) may strike her as chilly.Another possibility: Offer to post about her project on social media, inviting friends who are interested to contact her. Her feelings may still be hurt, depending on her emotional makeup. But you will have done what you can by refusing a friend kindly.I am a 38-year-old woman. For the last 12 years, I have lived with my older sister and younger brother in a house my sister and I bought. I now have a boyfriend, and things are getting serious between us. But even before meeting him, my siblings insisted he could never spend the night. So far, I have respected their wishes. But my boyfriend lives an hour away, so we are spending far too many hours in the car. We would also like to have an adult relationship. How should I handle this?Sarah, DenverHave you tried that old standby of younger sibling assertiveness? You are not the boss of me! They arent, you know. I assume that you and your sister did not make ground rules about guests before moving in together. (Note to other prospective roommates: Please do. And also talk about chores, expenses and early exits.) Also assumed: You have tried to introduce your boyfriend pleasantly at a delicious meal prepared by you. If so, dont let yourself be pushed around any longer.What you do in your bedroom is your business. Invite your beau to stay. (Discourage lazy afternoons with him hogging the living -room sofa.) Your siblings will probably get used to him. If they dont, let them know that you will accept a lump-sum payment of one-half of the current value of the house and find lodging elsewhere. As Joni Mitchell addressed a similar problem, musically: For Gods sake, Im middle- aged, Mama, time moves swift, and you know, happiness is the best face-lift. Dont let your siblings jeopardize a loving adult relationship."}
{"text": "Le Dme,  a nearly 900-square-foot suite in Le Cinq Codet in the heart of Paris, is named for its striking views of the golden Dme des Invalides, under which Napoleon is entombed. But if that vista doesnt grab you, wander over to the other end of the private terrace, past a half-dozen deck chairs (all yours) and gaze at the Eiffel Tower. And should you grow tired of that, there is always the Jacuzzi, from which you can look out over the mansard rooftops of the Seventh Arrondissement and polish off the Champagne and chocolates that were left while you were out. Inside theres a couch shaped like a croissant, a curved OLED television, two bathrooms, a dressing room and a tub ringed with white rose petals.As for the bill, it starts at about $2,000 a night. Dont raise an eyebrow. Le Dme (or the prestige suite online) is one of the more affordable luxury suites to be found these days. Consider the new Imperial Suite at the St. Regis Dubai, which starts at about $20,500 a night. Or the Katara Suite at Excelsior Hotel Gallia in Milan, from around $22,000 a night. Or the more than 12,000-square-foot penthouse at the Mark Hotel in Manhattan, which can be yours for some $75,000 a night. That, incidentally, is about the amount of money researchers at Princeton said one needs to earn in a year to be maximally happy.Are such rooms worth the price?Some hotels are betting on it. Luxury spending among affluent households in the United States was predicted to spike by 6.6 percent over the past year, according to the 2015 Survey of Affluence and Wealth from Time Inc. and YouGov, a market research company. Spending among one-percenters is at unprecedented levels, the study said. Even millennial travelers are spending: 45 percent are willing to pay more for true luxury in lodging, according to the 2015 Portrait of American Travelers from MMGY Global, a travel and hospitality marketing firm. From the United States to Hong Kong, the most robust hotel sectors today are economy and luxury.Our political and economical evolution are literally tied to the hotel industry, said Parag Vohra, general manager of hotels for Sojern, a travel technology company. When the middle class was rising, so were middle-tier hotels. Now as we hollow out in the middle, he said, you effectively have lodging doing very well at the high end or bottom.For those seeking the former, theres a new booking site for luxury suites. Suiteness.com, which is funded by investors, including Structure Capital and Keystone Capital, went live last year with more than 5,000 suites in 15 Las Vegas hotels. Since then it has added suites in Los Angeles, Miami and New York. London suites are coming. To use the site, you must sign up. A recent search for a room in Los Angeles turned up 163 suites with starting nightly rates between $316 and $25,000  a vast range. And that brings us to a fundamental question: What constitutes a suite?Words like suite and luxury mean different things in different cultures, places and contexts. Indeed, the word suite wasnt always associated with luxury. It was an upgrade, Mr. Vohra said. A more spacious product. But not luxury.The idea of luxury itself varies globally. In the West it generally means understated elegance (subdued colors, lots of daylight), said Mr. Vohra, whose hotel experience includes stints with Wyndham International and Marriott International. In Asian and Middle Eastern countries, he said, luxury is typically about opulence and service; having staff members tending to you in your room or escorting you to a restaurant, as they would at the Oberoi Udaivilas in Udaipur, India.In other words, a luxury suite is not just about the physical room; it carries alongside it prestige and a certain caliber of service. In March, for example, Rocco Forte Hotels announced a three-tier suites program. Guests of the highest level, the Forte Suites, are picked up at the airport and taken to their suite  which is filled with their favorite items such as flowers  for a private check-in. Among the first Forte Suites is the new Kipling Suite at Browns Hotel in London, where rates start at $8,938 a night (including the value added tax).Luxury has never been just about space, Mr. Vohra said. To conflate luxury with space is to undermine luxury.This is why the word suite is elastic. It might be six rooms or it might be one room. It might be 500 square feet or 9,000 square feet. There could be a terrace with sweeping vistas, or no outdoor space at all. The bill might run you $20,000 a night or $200 a night. Last year, the Hilton Chicago OHare Airport introduced 485-square-foot family suites  one room  starting at $134 a night. The Ritz-Carlton, Buckhead, in Georgia last year renovated two of its suites and both start at $479. You would be wise to look at the particulars of the room before you book to ensure that your idea of a suite is the same as the hotels.For many travelers, $479 a night is a splurge or downright impossible. For some, its a steal, and infinitely less preferable than the Sterling Suite at the Langham, London  a penthouse with a piano, media lounge and a 24-hour personal butler  which starts at nearly $35,000 a night. However much youre considering plunking down, the question is: If youre going to pay up, whats the payoff?Six years ago I wrote about how social scientists found that spending money on an experience, such as a vacation, makes people happier in the long run than spending money on objects like a watch or a piece of furniture. The logic is that humans are highly adaptable; we quickly become used to things, and with time they lose their allure. And as some researchers have pointed out, another person can have, say, the same watch as you, which makes yours less special.That doesnt happen with experiences. Experiences are unique. Even when they are shared, you interpret them in your own way. You own them forever. Indeed, researchers have found that reminiscing, reliving scenes that brought you joy, also boosts happiness.Which brings us back to the logic of spending big bucks for a luxurious suite. For instance, if you had a spare $5,000 or so, you could have a gathering in the GuestHouse at the Dream Downtown hotel in Manhattan, a 2,500-square-foot duplex penthouse suite with a terrace that was introduced last year. It has a fireplace, an outdoor shower and a glass-bottom Jacuzzi that can be seen from the suites living room below (consider yourself warned). A vibes curator can help create a party playlist or procure hors doeuvres.Its, well, ostentatious. Can such a thing translate to happiness?Ive never spoken with a scholar who made an academic case for a $5,000 hotel room. But if youre thinking about a once-in-a-lifetime night, consider how different suites deliver different experiences.Sometimes, the experience you want most is the one that costs (slightly) less. Take the Shangri-La Hotel in Paris, which has about three dozen suites. A recent search for a room with a terrace in May turned up a 750-square-foot duplex Eiffel Tower view suite for about $2,700 a night with no outdoor space. Also available was a 535-square-foot room (not a suite), known as a terrace Eiffel Tower view room, with a private terrace and views of the tower for about $1,500 a night  thats more than $1,000 cheaper than the suite at a loss of a mere 215 square feet. Some people might miss those square feet. But if I had $1,500 to throw around, Id take the regular room with the terrace.Obviously your dollars can be put to nobler use than a fancy hotel suite. But lets say youve saved some money to have fun with. Perhaps you might consider splurging on a very special experience, be it a honeymoon, an anniversary or a 50th birthday party.I decided to tally the top moments, the experiences as social scientists would say, that resulted from my one-night stay in Le Dme  not comforts or bragging rights but joys; ripples of happiness.They include: Looking across the street to see French friends huddling on their balcony, wine glasses in hand, laughing and talking as the sun began to disappear; seeing the Eiffel Tower twinkle in the dark as I wore a bathing suit, still damp from the Jacuzzi; truffles from Angelina at turn down; the glow of the Dme des Invalides as the sun fought through rainclouds; and the ability, now and forever, to remember the time when I was lucky enough to spend a night in a magical aerie in Paris."}
{"text": "As a child, Linnea Sanderson always had a basketball in her hand. When at age 14, her steady rise as a player was cut short by a serious back injury suffered during a pickup game, she bounced back, becoming a competitive tennis player and swimmer.Ms. Sanderson is also said to be a crack fisherwoman. As with so many of her other activities, she is typically good at it without seeming to try hard.Shes one of those people who are lucky to be born athletic, and persistent, said her mother, Helena Sanderson of Nashua, N.H. Ive told her I hope she lives long enough to use all of the God-given gifts.A stable relationship was one thing that Linnea Sanderson, now 32 and a third-year medical student at Brown University in Providence, R.I., had not excelled at. During the years she spent living and working as a high school teacher in Manhattan, she had spent plenty of time dating, but nothing endured.In New York, there were fantastically interesting and attractive men around every corner, she said. But the relationships were always so fast and fleeting.Then she looked further afield.It was late and cold on Feb. 23, 2013, when Ms. Sanderson finished celebrating her 29th birthday with friends in the Morningside Heights neighborhood of Manhattan. She had trudged toward her studio apartment on West 109th Street and run into an old flame on the wintry street. They detoured to a bar, where the former lovers shared a few more drinks, and nothing more than a kiss. Ms. Sanderson arrived home in the wee hours of the morning, tired and alone.Before turning off the lights, she logged on to OkCupid and decided to look for men in New Hampshire, where she had grown up. She knew it to be a place where life and relationships may not be so hurried.She soon found a profile for Robert Davidson. He seemed outdoorsy and also intelligent, she said, and I knew that if he lived on 109th Street, wed probably already be dating.Dr. Davidsons profile indicated that he lived in New Hampshire, 223 miles to the north. As a woman who appreciated math and symmetry, the fact that his distance matched her birthday seemed a plus. She sent a message that said only, Isnt it a coincidence that we live 223 miles apart?At the time, Dr. Davidson couldnt fathom the significance, numerical or otherwise.I messaged her back and our conversation was definitely interesting, said Dr. Davidson, 42, who holds a Ph.D. in genetics from Duke and works as a principal scientist at Avitide, a firm in Lebanon, N.H., that purifies pharmaceuticals. She seemed kindhearted with absurd humor, but the distance just seemed too far, he said. And she didnt have a car. I eventually decided it just wasnt worth my time replying.Things changed a year later when OkCupids location algorithm let him know that Ms. Sanderson had moved to Providence, 150 miles away. He sent a note asking how she was doing in medical school. And although she didnt remember him, after perusing his profile again, she agreed to take a train and meet him for a January dinner in Boston.On the appointed night, they looked across a chilly Boston Harbor as lightning darted across the sky and a stream of planes took off from Logan Airport. Ms. Sanderson, who has an abiding interest in aeronautic design, surprised him with her ability to identify the model of every plane.After dinner, he offered to drive her back to Providence so she wouldnt have to rush to the last train. She was so striking, but a total nerd, he said. She knew all about cytokines and seemed obsessed with airplane mechanics and engineering. Id never been to Providence and thought it was as good a time as any to get to know Rhode Islands capital.Before the date, Sean Love, a medical school colleague of Ms. Sandersons and a devotee of The Millionaire Matchmaker, offered advice about finding Mr. Right. I insisted she stick to one of my cardinal rules on their first date, no more than two drinks and no getting physical, he said. Faithful Linnea adhered to this.More than once, Dr. Davidson took a chance and drove three hours to Providence just to see if she could squeeze in brunch with him. At first I wasnt sure if it was creepy or not, she said.Eventually, Ms. Sanderson spent a weekend at Dr. Davidsons house on the shore of Mascoma Lake, in western New Hampshire. And soon, the couple began spending every weekend together, sometimes at the lake, where they fished and cooked together.While cooking, Dr. Davidson revealed his meticulous nature. Ms. Sanderson said, The first time my mother met him, she was struck by the uniformity of his vegetable cutting, saying she thought the squash and carrots looked machine-chopped.Everywhere they went, including regular visits to Rhode Island and New York, they doted on Ms. Sandersons rescued terrier, Penny. Penny is the center of her universe, said Patricia Lomando, Ms. Sandersons friend since seventh grade. I knew Rob was the one for Linnea when she sent me a photo of Rob napping on the bed with Penny tucked under his arm.David Watts, Dr. Davidsons friend from graduate school, said: He started making decisions and sacrifices Id never seen before. He became generous with his time, thoughtful about his career and more careful as a listener. He felt strongly enough about Linnea to buy a condominium in Providence so she would have a safe place to live.It was on the basketball court that Ms. Sanderson most surprised Dr. Davidsons friends. She could execute an up-and-under move that could result in a college-level basketball player looking quite foolish, Dr. Davidson said with pride.Im not someone who loses well or easily, he said. But Linnea is naturally good at a lot of things I pride myself at being good at, so I have to learn the lesson of humility. She can play competitively at just about any sport you want to try to pick up: Ping-Pong, croquet, darts, pool. However, she really takes tremendous pride in none of it. Shes much more proud of her artistic abilities and of attaining knowledge and mostly of the relationships shes built.A year after they began dating, Dr. Davidson surprised her with a marriage proposal at exactly 2:23 p.m.  just as she was stepping off the Boston train to meet him.The couple had wanted to wed before their friends and family at the Annisquam Village Church in Gloucester, Mass., on Leap Day, Feb. 29, because its magical, with physics, astronomy, time and history melting together to give the world a bonus day, Ms. Sanderson said.But because it fell on a Monday, it didnt work with my school schedule, or anyone elses work schedules, she said.Instead, on Jan. 2, the groom and groomsmen began the day with a polar plunge before the nonbinding ceremony at the church. A reception for 135 followed at Cruiseport, a large event space in Gloucester.We wanted to celebrate with friends and family during the holidays when I had a break from school and our guests could spend a long weekend, she said.Nevertheless, he said, they remained committed to legally solemnize on Leap Day. Besides the wedding couple, in attendance were the Rev. Deirdre Greenwood White, the Presbyterian minister who had led the earlier ceremony; the brides mother and younger brother Jeff; and Penny, the brides dog, who, like her owner, walked down the aisle for the second time.After they exchanged their vows, the doubly married couple rang the churchs old brass bell to announce their wedding. Ms. Sanderson, wearing her silk bias-cut wedding gown for the second time, announced, Were going to get married again on April Fools Day, because as long as the dress fits, I want to get married monthly."}
{"text": "I was, for a time, supposed to be a grandmaster So begins Chucks speech to the troops after Donnies death, a kind of anti-pep talk to mourn the loss of their case against Axe Capital and his white whale, Bobby Axelrod. The world doesnt need another chess metaphor, but this is a rare moment of self-awareness for Chuck, who isnt the type to acknowledge his own flaws readily. Men dont get to his position by virtue of modesty and self-deprecation, but Chuck takes a big step by acknowledging that confidence and bravado are not always virtues, either.The poker metaphor for this  which the shows creators Brian Koppelman and David Levien know well, having written the movie Rounders  is going on tilt, being so frustrated by a bad run that you lose all sense of discipline and overplay your hands. But the chess analogy stands, because Chuck is playing a long game against Bobby and its not checkmate yet. He can take a breath, reformulate a strategy and return to the board.Its hard to say what gaming metaphor works for Bobby, because no set of rules applies to him. Quality of Life goes further than any episode to date in revealing the dark, howling chasm where his soul should be. For Bobby to use Donnie as a false informant in the case against him shows cunning, but for him to deploy a terminal cancer diagnosis like a dirty bomb is an evil of a different kind. Maybe hes a grandmaster for seeing the possibilities in Donnies illness, just as he seized the chance to make some lucrative moves on Sept. 11, but he has to be liberated from basic decency to make it happen. Even if he could be defended for making a deal with Donnie  $40 million in exchange for a few difficult months as a saboteur  he sees far enough ahead to make sure Donnie dies on schedule. The top oncologist out there is on Bobbys payroll, and if the extension of Donnies life mucks with his timeline, the good doctor can be compelled to forget the Hippocratic oath.Billions is not a politically minded show per se. Its creators are not offering a tsking expos on Wall Street so much as theyre luxuriating in the excesses of power. But Quality of Life imagines Bobby as a creature of pure capitalism, motivated only by the bloodless pursuit of money, without concern for what it means for anyone but himself. In that respect, its like the sprawling Canadian documentary The Corporation, which takes the legal personhood status granted to companies literally and determines that corporate person to be a sociopath. (And not a harmless sociopath, either.) For all his execrable qualities, Chuck can at least claim to have a prevailing instinct for fairness and social order, whatever underhanded means he uses to that end. Bobby wants only to win, and one of the shows consistent pleasures is witnessing what a man without scruples is capable of accomplishing. Its like writers-room limbo: How low can he go?With the case currently in shambles, our two grandmasters can turn to opponents more easily dispatched. After having the case against Dollar Bill Stearn tossed out in court, Chuck moves against a business-friendly federal judge, Whit Wilcox, who didnt think $89 million in profit off a $211,000 investment was worth a hearing. His play on Wilcox is vintage Chuck, motivated by a mix of punitive rage and genuine righteousness. He couldnt have known in advance that Wilcox was getting kickbacks from a privatized prison system for jailing minorities, but once Lonnie Watley snuffs it out, Chuck makes a five-course meal out of it. His farewell speech  Justice, rooted in truth, watered by tenacity and flowered by wisdom  drips delicious sarcasm like sap from a Vermont maple tree, and the honoree fully deserves it. But Paul Giamatti suggests the sadism that colors Chucks nobility here: Its not enough to achieve justice. He needs to humiliate his adversary, too.Having played Chuck and the company for fools, Bobby also keeps his talons sharp by stalking weaker prey. He may have understood why investors and protesters were turned off by the Sept. 11 revelations, but damned if hes going to let turncoats get away with defecting. When Stearn makes his triumphant return to Axe Capital, Bobby fakes a fight with him in order to make it seem like theyre on the outs, making it plausible for Stearn to connect with other Axe exiles in their new investment firm, Ionesphere. Compared to the Donnie Caan gambit, its a bush league move from Bobby, but then, Team Ionesphere isnt as formidable as Chuck Rhoades. One howler of a trade sinks the business, and Bobby swoops in to save Ionesphere by squeezing it under his armpit. Keep your friends close and your enemies closer.Bulls and Bears The use of Chumbawambas Tubthumping to underscore Bobbys resilience is slyly, bitterly ironic. Most remember the band for that song only, with its irresistible singalong chorus (I get knocked down/But I get up again/Youre never gonna keep me down), but Chumbawamba was a politically motivated outfit that existed for 17 years before their one hit and for another 15 years after that. Given the bands leftist/anarchist/anticapitalist leanings, the Bobby Axelrod association is a tough one. Structuring the episode around Donnies funeral proves to be an awkward device, because its not entirely clear where we are in the timeline. Its a good idea to keep coming back to the funeral, because it recontextualizes different relationships among the attendees, but it isnt as well organized as it might have been. Have them all bury my picture in autumn leaves, and as they do, they should make a wish to the world that has nothing to do with financial markets. R.I.P., Donnie. As a tribute to you, well look into investing in an up-and-coming tech outfit called Apple. Laras Corleone-esque commitment to family has brought her into fascinating conflict with Wendy, whos starting to piece together the $40 million deal the company made with Donnie before he died. That Lara knows about the deal says a lot about her character. That Wendy wasnt privy to it says a lot about hers, too."}
{"text": "JERSEY CITY  Anxious parents may wonder how a major school system like Newarks could overlook lead in the drinking water of 30 schools and 17,000 students. The answer: It was easy. They had to look only a few miles away, at the century-old classrooms of the schools here, across the Hackensack River.The Jersey City Public Schools district discovered lead contamination in eight schools drinking fountains in 2006, and in more schools in 2008, 2010 and 2012. But not until 2013 did officials finally chart a comprehensive attack on lead, which by then had struck all but six schools.This winters crisis in Flint, Mich., has cast new attention on lead in water supplies. But problems with lead in school water supplies have dragged on for years  aggravated by ancient buildings and plumbing, prolonged by official neglect and tight budgets, and enabled by a gaping loophole in federal rules that largely exempts schools from responsibility for the purity of their water.Children are at greatest risk from lead exposure, and school is where they spend much of their early lives. But cash-starved school administrators may see a choice between spending money on teachers or on plumbing as no choice at all.They feel its almost better not to sample, because youre better off not knowing, Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech civil engineering professor who has fought for lead safety nationwide, said in an interview.The problem is persistent and widespread. Baltimores public schools switched entirely to bottled water in 2007 because ripping out the lead plumbing would have been impractical. Sebring, Ohio, found elevated lead levels in August after workers had stopped adding an anti-corrosion chemical to the water supply.The Los Angeles Unified School District allotted $19.8 million in September to retrofit or remove its 48,000 drinking fountains to erase a small but tenacious lead threat. Ithaca, N.Y., schools switched temporarily to bottled water in January after water tests found elevated lead levels at two schools.Congress could easily have cracked down on lead in schools. In fact, it once did. The 1988 Lead Contamination Control Act required schools to scrap lead-lined water coolers, test drinking water and remedy any contamination they found. But a federal appeals court struck down part of the law affecting schools in 1996. And while some states have devised their own lead-testing rules, federal lawmakers have yet to revisit the issue.The only regulation left is a 1991 rule by the federal Environmental Protection Agency requiring periodic tests for lead and copper by most public water systems, whether the supplier is a big utility or a well in a trailer park or campground.But although schools and day care centers are the main sources of water for children on most weekdays, only the few schools that operate their own wells fall under the rule. The vast majority of schools use treated water from utilities.And while the utilities test their water, virtually all lead contamination occurs inside schools  in lead pipes, water-cooler coils and linings, and in leaded-metal fountains and taps.If youre a mom-and-pop coffee shop in Sparta, New Jersey, and have a private well, youre required to certify every quarter, said Robert Barrett, the chief executive of Aqua Pro-Tech Laboratories, a New Jersey environmental testing laboratory. But if youre a school, you dont have to do anything.Mr. Barrett, whose firm tests water in 13 states, said the Newark and Flint revelations prompted reassessments by schools and other institutions that had not scrutinized their plumbing in years, if ever.No one was testing, he said. Now all of a sudden theyre all going crazy.In Newark, where school officials disclosed elevated lead levels earlier this month, Mr. Barretts firm began testing water systemwide on March 19. Students at the 30 schools now drink bottled water, and the youngest students were offered free blood tests.There, as in Los Angeles, high lead levels persisted even though workers flush the water pipes every weekday to push out lead that accumulates overnight. Nor did some filters on Newark school fountains reduce contamination sufficiently.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says children whose blood lead content exceeds five micrograms per deciliter  50 parts per billion, or less than a millionth of an ounce in a pint  should see a doctor. High blood lead levels can stunt a childs mental development and damage a range of organs. But even smaller amounts can affect childrens intellectual development, and the agency says no level of lead is safe.The E.P.A.s 1991 lead rule  the one that requires most public water systems to periodically test for lead and copper  limits the amount of lead in drinking water to no more than 15 parts per billion. The rule is being revised, though, and that limit could soon be lowered. Even though the rule does not apply to most schools, districts that do monitor drinking water generally use it as a guideline.Tainted water is not the biggest source of lead exposure in humans; on average, the E.P.A. says, it makes up about a fifth of contamination. Pregnant women working in schools are at greatest risk because fetuses are most profoundly affected by contamination. Women face an increased risk of miscarriage, along with potential organ damage and developmental problems in the baby.Schools built before 1986, when an amendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act banned lead plumbing, pose the greatest hazard. Fountains may be fed water through lead pipes commonly used in the early 20th century. Older water coolers may have lead linings and components.But even newer buildings can face a threat. Under industry pressure, Congress defined lead-free in the amendment as no more than 8 percent lead. Plumbing hardware like faucets and connectors often contained that much lead until 2013, when the permissible level fell to near zero.Los Angeles school officials learned of the 8-percent rule the hard way. In the 131 schools built over the last decade, the district installed thousands of water fountains with long-lasting brass fittings to reduce maintenance costs. They later discovered that the leaded brass fittings tainted the water in some fountains beyond the E.P.A.s lead standard.The districts $19.8 million lead initiative seeks, in part, to correct that. The approach were taking now is to get rid of anything with a brass fitting, Roger Finstad, the districts maintenance and operations director, said.In New York City, officials have uprooted and replaced all lead pipes leading from water mains into schools, swiftly replaced equipment when tests showed high lead levels, and ordered weekly pipe flushing at any school with a violation. All schools water is regularly tested. The result? Only 1.3 percent of nearly 90,000 water tests have exceeded the citys lead threshold. The program is a model for the nation, said Dr. Philip Landrigan, an expert on lead and a professor of preventive medicine and pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.That scorched-earth approach is the surest way to control lead threats, but few school systems have the money or knowledge to pursue it. Many instead follow a whack-a-mole strategy, testing a sample of water sources, then fixing or disabling ones with excessive lead concentrations.That can be ineffective, because the levels at any fountain or tap can swing wildly as residue breaks loose in lead plumbing. Dr. Edwards, the Virginia Tech specialist, recalled testing a single tap 10 times. Eight tests judged the water perfectly safe. The other two showed astronomical amounts of lead, he said, like eating five to 10 paint chips.This is like Russian roulette, he said.So it was in Newark, where the E.P.A. sampled water in 2003 as part of an outreach program on lead, and found contamination in three schools. The district began replacing school water fountains and installing filters on violating water sources, but never got ahead of the problem. From 2012 through 2015, nearly one in eight water samples exceeded the E.P.A.s 15 parts-per-billion threshold.Did we know we had a problem? Yes, said Marion A. Bolden, Newarks superintendent early last decade.  Did we think we had adequately remediated the problem? Yes.Here in Jersey City, the public schools are classic candidates for a lead problem. Two-thirds are over 80 years old, and a third more than a century old. The system had been under state control since 1989 because of poor management and low test scores; only recently, with Marcia Lyles as the superintendent, did the state agree to return control to local officials.Jersey City taps and fountains went untested until the E.P.A. took samples in 2006, again part of the federal outreach program, and turned up lead concentrations up to 60 times the federal threshold at eight schools. Not until early 2008, after more tests found fresh contamination at six of the schools, did the superintendent at the time, Charles T. Epps Jr., switch those students to bottled water.Jersey Citys mayor then, Jerramiah Healy, declared the matter closed. We believe this is a situation that is isolated to the affected schools and to certain water fountains within those schools, T he Jersey Journal newspaper quoted him as saying.Mr. Healy was wrong. The district tested all its fountains and taps in mid-2008 and found that water in 27 more schools was as much as 80 times higher than the E.P.A.s lead threshold. Under pressure from advocates, the district tested selected water sources at 38 buildings in 2010 and found yet more lead. In a 98-year-old school, Nicolaus Copernicus Elementary, 16 of 19 water fountains and coolers were found above permissible levels.That school and some others were switched to bottled water, and fountains and taps were turned off. But that was not the end.A 2013 retest of all 2,000-plus water sources found yet more contamination, including one fountain whose water tested 853 times the accepted maximum. Among those water sources were 10 in prekindergarten classes where daily tooth brushing was part of the regimen.Any fountains in this building, they dont even work, the Nicolaus Copernicus principal, Diane Pistilli, said this week. Parents were concerned, and rightly so."}
{"text": "LeBron James peeled his body off a courtside chair earlySaturdayand ambled onto the court at Madison Square Garden. The arena was quiet as the Cleveland Cavaliers began to warm up for their morning shootaround. James grabbed a ball and flung up a few midrange jump shots.If I miss a couple jumpers early, my next 10 are going to be in that blue, James said to his teammate Channing Frye, gesturing to the paint.Frye did not miss a beat.If I miss a couple jumpers, Ill be sitting on the side, he said, and the players laughed.But James, Frye and the Cavaliers had no such problems when they encountered the Knicks that night. There was no need to resort to Plan B. They surged to a 17-point first-quarter lead and did not falter, thrashing the Knicks, 107-93, before an impassive sellout crowd.Two nights after a surprising loss to the Nets, the Cavaliers (52-21) were back on track to establishing their playoff mind-set. Two nights after a surprising win over the Chicago Bulls, the Knicks (30-44) plunged back to their forlorn reality.James recorded a triple-double, producing 27 points, 11 rebounds, 10 assists, 2 blocked shots and a steal. Kevin Love contributed 28 points and 12 rebounds for the Cavaliers, who played without Kyrie Irving, who sat out to rest. Carmelo Anthony led the Knicks with 28 points  23 in the second half  and 9 rebounds.Cleveland Coach Tyronn Lue said of James, He is getting stronger as the season winds down, and that is a big plus for us.It was a game James was eager to play. At the morning shootaround, he said he enjoyed being at the Garden and facing Anthony, a close friend. Their relationship had been in the spotlight since the website Bleacher Report published an articleon Wednesdayabout the players ties. James was quoted as saying he would like to play on the same team as Anthony, Dwyane Wade and Chris Paul before their careers were over.On Saturday, when a reporter began to remark that he thought Anthonys assists-per-game average could be a career high for him, James interjected with the exact number, as if to emphasize their attachment. James praised Anthonys skills and unselfish play this season. But he declined to pass judgment on the sad state of the Knicks.Anytime I comment on somebody elses situation, James said, it gets blown out of proportion. I just want my good friend to be healthy and to play the game he loves and be happy about playing the game he loves.James was far less cordial to Anthony and the Knicks on the court. Three minutes intoSaturdaysgame, James swished his first shot, a 3-pointer, from in front of the Cavaliers bench. Two minutes later, he stole the ball from Kristaps Porzingis and dashed the length of the court for a layup. James notched his sixth assist of the game with 1 minute 58 seconds left in the first quarter.As the final seconds ticked off the clock in the opening period, James moved to the left and drained a fallaway jumper from 20 feet. He took a seat on the bench, finally, with 8 points, 6 assists and 4 rebounds after just one quarter.The Cavaliers had a 24-point lead at halftime. The Knicks woke up during the third quarter, scoring 40 points, but their inability to defend kept the deficit at 17 heading into the final period. The Knicks showed signs of life again in the fourth, but they could not get closer than 10 points.Its definitely fun, Anthony said about squaring off against James. I wish I could have won, but its definitely fun.The outcome, the one-sidedness of it, could have been expected. James and the Cavaliers had bigger goals than beating the Knicks. They are the top team in the Eastern Conference and hope to return to the N.B.A. finals.I believe in what we have, and I know we can win a championship with the group we have, and Im confident in my ability to lead this group, said James, who acknowledged he was shifting his focus to the postseason. My whole mind-set is getting these guys ready for the long run, and I think we have enough  no, I dont think; I know we have enough. We just got to go out and do it.James seemed ready. With seconds remaining in the third quarter, he made a lacerating left-handed drive to the basket and finished a crushing two-handed dunk over Lou Amundson. The crowd let out a unified, guttural noise. It was the loudest the building would get all night.Bopping on his toes, James turned and looked toward Amundson, who was tottering away. James stared a second too long, perhaps, as a referee issued him a technical foul.After the game, Anthony said he was happy about Jamess success."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  BARACK OBAMA is tangoing into history, and theres something perfect about that.The tango has been described as vertical solitude. And this president is all about vertical solitude.Republicans are frothing and comics are tweaking about the baseball diplomacy in Cuba and the tango diplomacy in Argentina, juxtaposed with the terrorist attack and manhunt in Brussels.Comedy Centrals Larry Wilmore mocked Obamas spring break world tour. He chided the president for doing the wave with Ral Castro and remarked on Obamas sinuous, take-charge tango partner. O.K., Republicans, now hes leading from behind, Wilmore said. Rush Limbaugh accused the president of flamenco dancing and doing the tango with women not even his wife.Yes, that outrageous sin of being polite to your foreign hosts at a state dinner.Barack Obama started off as a man self-consciously alone on stage and thats how he is exiting. He is, for better and worse, too cool for school. His identity is defined by his desire to rise above the fray. Unfortunately, he is in politics, which is the fray.Obama shot to prominence at the 2004 Democratic National Convention with a rousing speech about boldly moving past our barriers  red and blue, black and white. But those divisions are more pronounced than ever. So now he brings people together and gets things done when he can, like importing modernity to Cuba and inveigling China on climate change.The president has a bristling resistance to what he sees as cheap emotion. (See: flag pin, 2008.) That has led him, time after time, to respond belatedly or bloodlessly in moments when Americans are alarmed, wanting solace and solutions.The Christmas bomber; the BP oil spill; James Foley beheaded by ISIS, the Paris attacks, the San Bernardino attacks, and now Brussels, which he discussed rationally and briefly with ESPN at the baseball game, wearing cool $485 Oliver Peoples sunglasses beside a cool Derek Jeter.He feels that fanatics who are not an existential threat to us want to disrupt our lives and we should not let them; that more people die slipping in their bathtubs than in terrorist attacks.That anthropological detachment  the failure to viscerally connect and vigorously persuade, the lip-curling at needy lawmakers, jittery Americans or anyone else who does not see things as he does  may keep him from being a Mount Rushmore president.Obama went to a baseball game with Ral Castro just 15 months into their working relationship. It took him six years, with his trade bill  one of his top foreign policy initiatives  on the line, to go to the congressional baseball game, toting some White House home brew.If he were up for re-election, the president probably would have forced himself to appear more emotionally responsive to the terrorist attacks, urged on by his staff.But he clearly feels liberated in the homestretch, relishing what he can do alone, venting privately about world leaders, lawmakers and pundits who have not risen to his lofty standards. Once he read about F.D.R.s legislative prowess. Lately, he has been buffing up on Teddy Roosevelt blowing a raspberry at Congress and expanding executive power.I traveled with the president to Havana to watch as he did the logical thing, bypassing the inane and antiquated congressional embargo to help move Cuba past its sepia arrested development.There was a muted excitement in repressed Havana around the low-risk trip, a precursor to opening the Cuba wing in the Obama presidential library.Obama, with his elegant family along, deftly maneuvered in the chaos of communism, charming the 84-year-old Ral Castro even though the White House did not know which bits of historic pageantry the Cuban would play along with.After months of intense negotiations, the dictator told the president at the last minute that he would do a news conference  the first anyone could remember in Cuba. But clearly Castro had not been briefed that the two American journalists multipart questions would include tart ones for him. Standing at a lectern flanked by plush burgundy drapes with RP embossed in gold on them in the Revolutionary Palace  which sounds like an oxymoron  Castro bridled when Andrea Mitchell asked him about human rights. Afterward, Latin correspondents noted that if Mitchell were not American, she would be spending the afternoon in jail.When the Cubans bobbled a photo op at the Jos Mart memorial in Revolutionary Square, President Obama took over and directed the group to its picture in front of a Che Guevara mural.He was a long way from 2008, when a Fox TV channel in Houston blew up a story about an Obama volunteer who had the unpatriotic temerity to have a Cuban flag with a picture of Che at her desk.Conservatives then were trying to smear Obama as a socialist. Now many Democratic voters, especially young ones, are disappointed that Obama wasnt liberal enough and are gravitating toward a real socialist rather than the presidents preferred successor.Obama is trying to untangle the Gordian knots in a Middle East shattered by his predecessor; it was W.s unwarranted invasion of Iraq that unwittingly created ISIS, as the veteran war correspondent Michael Ware points out in his new movie, Only the Dead.While Republicans who would succeed Obama talked loco last week  Ted Cruz vowed to carpet-bomb ISIS and Donald Trump refused to rule out nuclear strikes  Obamas military leaders announced that they had killed two top ISIS leaders.The president can go to a ballgame and still keep his eye on the ball."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas traded insults on Easter Sunday morning over recent smears against their wives, while Mr. Trump ruled out creating internment camps for American Muslims and said he would study a proposal to allow delegates to bring guns to the Republican National Convention.Appearing on rival Sunday news programs, the two candidates showed no desire to tone down or back off their exchange of harsh personal attacks, which have played out over the past week against a backdrop of terrorist attacks in Brussels and President Obamas trip to Cuba.Mr. Trump, the leading Republican candidate, categorically denied that he or anyone from his campaign played a role in a National Enquirer report on Friday suggesting that Mr. Cruz may have had extra-marital affairs. The report by the magazine came after Mr. Trump threatened to spill the beans on Mr. Cruzs wife, Heidi, a cryptic remark that Mr. Trump elevated on Sunday into a dark insinuation.There are things about Heidi that I dont want to talk about, Mr. Trump said on ABCs This Week. You could look, but I dont want to talk about them.Mr. Cruz, appearing on Fox News Sunday, repeated his contention that his rivals fingerprints were on the report because it included a comment from a former Trump political adviser, Roger Stone, and because Mr. Trump is friends with the owner of the Enquirer. He called the report garbage and said it was disgusting to see a candidate attacking the spouse of another  while at the same time denying that he had anything to do with a mailing by a Super PAC featuring a mostly unclothed Melania Trump, Mr. Trumps wife and a former model, that circulated in Utah before Tuesdays primary there.The warfare over spouses represents an attempt by Mr. Trump to get under Mr. Cruzs skin, just like he did, effectively, with former rivals like Jeb Bush and Ben Carson. Mr. Trump also continues to use social media like Twitter to focus the race on personality and language rather than policy: He denied disparaging Mrs. Cruz by posting an unflattering photo of her on his Twitter page by noting that it was simply a retweet of another users post. He added that he would not use Twitter very much as president compared to his current tendency to send flurries of late-night tweets.On Fox News Sunday, Mr. Cruz argued that Mr. Trump had a habit of turning to personal attacks when he gets scared, particularly on foreign policy, and said he was doing so now because he was out of his depth with recent comments like suggesting that United States pull back from NATO unless other nations pay more of the alliances costs. Mr. Trump repeated that view on Sunday and called NATO obsolete in the fight against terrorism.Mr. Trump was also asked if he would rule out internment camps for American Muslims  an idea he has never proposed, though he has argued for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country if they are not American citizens.I would rule it out, but we would have to be very vigilant, Mr. Trump said. If were not very, very strong and very, very smart, we have a big, big problem coming up. Weve already had the problem. Check out the World Trade Center, check out the Pentagon. Weve already had the problem.Mr. Trump declined to take a position on a petition to allow guns at the Republican convention, contending that delegates at the high-security event risk being sitting ducks, utterly helpless against evil-doers and criminals. Mr. Trump said he had not seen the petition, which is aimed at candidates like himself, and that he would have to review it before commenting, although he noted he was a very, very strong person for the Second Amendment.The third Republican candidate, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who is running far behind his rivals in the race for the partys nomination, expressed new hesitancy on Sunday to support Mr. Trump if he becomes the nominee.Were going to look at it every single day, and well see what happens, he said on NBCs Meet the Press. Weve got a long way to go. I dont want to project that hes going to be the nominee. I dont think he will be. And if he is  well have to, I will review it every day. Pushed by moderator Chuck Todd on whether he would back Mr. Trump, Mr. Kasich said, I said what I said, Chuck, and Im done talking about this subject.In the Democratic race, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont appeared on three Sunday shows after his sweep of caucuses in Alaska, Hawaii, and Washington on Saturday. On CNNs State of the Union, he said those and other recent landslide victories gave him a path toward victory in his race against Hillary Clinton to accumulate the 2,383 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.Mrs. Clinton holds a strong delegate lead over Mr. Sanders, but after Saturdays caucuses, it shrunk to about 265 pledged delegates from about 300. Mrs. Clintons lead remains all but insurmountable because both candidates will continue accruing delegates through the final primaries in June; delegates are awarded based on each Democrats proportion of the total vote. Mr. Sanders would need to win extremely large landslides in California, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, and other states to overtake Mrs. Clinton in pledged delegates, which even some Sanders advisers say is unlikely.On CNN, Mr. Sanders alluded to his best-case scenario: Winning enough pledged delegates to stop Mrs. Clinton from reaching the 2,383 magic number. If that happens, Democratic Party leaders and officials who are known as super-delegates would decide the race, as they did in 2008 in the nomination fight between Mrs. Clinton and Barack Obama.In the current race a majority of super-delegates have sided with Mrs. Clinton, but they can change their minds at any time. Mr. Sanders said he would try to win them over with polls showing he would beat Mr. Trump by larger margins than Mrs. Clinton, and with arguments that super-delegates should back him if he won their states primaries and caucuses.A lot of these super-delegates may rethink their position with Secretary Clinton, Mr. Sanders said. A lot of them have not yet declared, and then youve got super-delegates who are in states where we win by 40 or 50 points. I think their own constituents are going to say to them, Hey, why dont you support the people of our state  vote for Sanders.CNNs Jake Tapper also asked Mr. Sanders about a recent news report suggesting that the senator would only support Mrs. Clinton as the Democratic nominee if she endorsed five of his policy priorities, like a single-payer health care system.No, I dont think weve ever framed things in that sense, Mr. Sanders said before focusing again on his own determination to win the nomination.Mrs. Clinton had no media interviews or campaign events scheduled for Sunday."}
{"text": "There ought to be a word for the opposite of a strip tease. It would be defined as an act that teases, but not because of what is taken off. The tease comes from what is put on.We need that word to describe what happened this week during a crucial moment of Better Call Saul. Jimmy McGill is driving by a car dealership and spots one of those bucking, swaying inflatable air dancers that are supposed to grab your attention and lead you to think, Why, this would be a fine place to buy a car. Jimmy stares while stuck briefly in traffic and is soon wearing the grin of a man who has had an epiphany.The nature of that epiphany is unclear until Jimmy is suddenly seen making room in his closet for the garish suits, ties and shirts that will become Saul Goodmans go-to look in Breaking Bad. The air dancer, we see in a montage that soon follows, was tricked out as if he were wearing a florid outfit including a red jacket and a yellow polka dot tie.For a moment I thought Jimmy was about to metamorphose, at long last, into Saul. In fact, the outfits are part of Jimmys campaign to make himself noxious enough to be pushed from the job he loathes at Davis & Main.A bit of a tease.It turns out that Better Call Saul is, above all else, a character study and as the writers of this show delve into Jimmys psyche, they are also laying out the origins of Saul Goodman. Last season we discovered where Saul got the idea for his name  the phrase SAll good, man  and now we know where he came up with his wacky threads.Inflatable, as this episode is titled, is yet another story of self-discovery. It starts with Jimmy as a boy, in his fathers store, encountering a con man who explains that the world is wolves and sheep and advises him to figure out which one youre gonna be. As a boy, Jimmys answer is wolf, as we see when he swipes a few dollars from his fathers till. (This suggests that Chuck wasnt fibbing when, in an earlier episode, he told Kim that Jimmy was responsible for their fathers accounting shortfalls. At the same time, McGill the Elder is revealed as a soft touch, and Chuck doesnt seem to have factored ill-advised handouts into the math.)Wolf doesnt seem to suit Jimmy as an adult, but he isnt a sheep either. So we find him in this episode looking for a middle way. Exactly what that path might look like is a mystery. But when Kim asks what kind of lawyer Jimmy would be if the two partnered up, per Jimmys plan, he cant bring himself to promise the straight and narrow.You gonna play it straight, Kim asks, or you gonna be colorful?Jimmy starts to say hell play it straight, but after a peek at the ring that once belonged to his partner in small-time hustling, his conscience gets the better of him. He has to be honest about his penchant for  lets call it creativity.Theres no point in me doing this if I cant be myself, he says.Colorful it will be. Kim has her interview at Schweikarts firm, then takes a cigarette break to ponder her future. She visits Jimmy in his nail salon closet-home office to make a counteroffer. Forget a two-person firm. How about two separate practices under one roof?And that is where we appear to be headed as Inflatable ends. Jimmy has finally ended his experiment with respectability, and Kim is ready to leap from the corporate-law-firm world that has been her professional home for about a decade. The Jimmy and Kim show seems about to go pro. If it happens  note that Jimmy didnt agree to this arrangement before the screen went black  lets wish these crazy kids the best.Anyone else worried about Kim? Lets think about Jimmys previous co-workers. There was that guy in Cicero  the one with the ring  who died of a heart attack. There is Clifford Main, who ends up bouncing Jimmy out the door, though not before likening him, in the coarsest terms, to a body part rarely spoken of in polite company. Jimmy certainly has done right by many clients. But suffice it to say, when we meet Saul Goodman in Breaking Bad, he is a solo practitioner.Before leaving the subject, we should note that there seems to be a curious lack of erotic heat between Jimmy and Kim. For two people in the early throes of love, its striking how little physical contact they have. A sofa cuddle, a goodbye peck on the cheek.The Mike story crisscrosses Jimmys when the two visit a prosecutor to say that, on second thought, the gun found when he was assaulted wasnt Tucos. Mike has always had a gangsters sang-froid, but after a lifetime as a cop, he has apparently adopted the gangsters no-snitch ethos. Against his will, and only after earning some badly needed cash, it should be noted.At least some of that cash is going toward the dream home of Stacey, his daughter-in-law. It seems as if the relocation has been provoked by Staceys (apparently fanciful) sense that someone was shooting at her former home. Im uncertain why these putative shooters would not be able to track her to this new abode; shes about to sign papers with a real estate agent, suggesting that she isnt hiding. But because its a much better home, one has to wonder if Stacey is playing Mike in some way.The notion seems unsupported by the writing or by Kerry Condons performance. Nothing that Stacey has done or said has implied duplicity. She may be dimly aware that guilt will inspire Mike to give her and her daughter whatever she needs, and more. Either that or shes a little bit nutty.For those who prefer this show with generous portions of Mexican fare, this episode is a letdown. Mike parks his car across the street from the restaurant where he negotiated with Hector, the cartel honcho, and stares. Then he stares some more.Another tease! Better Call Saul has already made it clear that it will take its sweet time with just about everything, and that includes action. Then again, unless Mike is looking for a good quesadilla, he is up to something. And whatever that something is will be clear next week.I want to close by highlighting what may be my favorite bit of dialogue in the season thus far:Kim: I see you got your old car back.Jimmy: Yeah, the kidney people wouldnt take it."}
{"text": "In the age of streaming music, there is no shortage of nostalgia for record stores that fostered a sense of community and also sold tangible products. But in mourning that mostly bygone era of erudite clerks and obscure, collectible titles, its possible to overlook the very recent past  namely, the more mainstream 90s CD culture, with its megachains like Tower Records and Sam Goody.That period, when music sales were booming, will be the focus of a coming book, Record Store, by Jack Antonoff, the Grammy-winning singer, songwriter and producer behind hits for Taylor Swift and Sara Bareilles, along with his own bands Bleachers and Fun.The books publisher, Simon & Schuster, described Record Store in an announcement as a heavily illustrated anthology of essays, interviews, photographs, and ephemera  commissioned and organized by Mr. Antonoff  that will pay tribute to the cherished, and endangered, cultural institution. While no official publication date has been set, Mr. Antonoff said he was aiming for a release next year.Mr. Antonoff, 31, explained in an interview that the project was based largely on his youth as a voracious CD consumer in suburban New Jersey  far from the popular perception of a record-store patron as a crate-digging vinyl obsessive.It seems like the nerdy record-collector type owns the conversation, he said. But that wasnt my experience growing up, and it wasnt the experience of a lot of people I know.Record Store will be the opposite of an old, crotchety, things-were-better, dusty book about vinyl, he added.Instead, it will draw on Mr. Anontoffs entertainment-industry connections to tell personal stories about record-store culture for the majority of us  looking at it from the perspective of a very normal kid who went to these stores to find out about music and wasnt part of some superelite.While he declined to name any future contributors because the book is still in the planning stages, Mr. Antonoff said, Its not going to be just a bunch of famous people  thatll be a piece of it. (He can often be spotted on social media with artists like Lorde, Ms. Swift, Charli XCX and his girlfriend, Lena Dunham.)But the anthology will include everyone from really notable people to the guy that managed the Tower Records where I grew up, he said, while also addressing independent local shops.Record Store was inspired in part by issues of Rolling Stone from the 90s, with their endless ads for CD racks and other accessories, along with the youth-culture Rookie Yearbook and the limited-run magazine Grand Royal, published by the Beastie Boys from 1993 to 1997. A lot like the zines I made when I was a kid, perfectly mixed with the art books I look at now, Mr. Antonoff said.And with vinyl having a bit of an extended renaissance, Mr. Antonoff is counting on something similar for CDs. Were right in the middle of this moment when we think that time period was a big, weird joke, but it was how most of us discovered music, he said of his generation. These are already antique artifacts. At some point there will be a tipping point where these things are going to be so important."}
{"text": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  A suicide bomber set off a powerful blast close to a childrens swing set in a public park on Sunday evening in the eastern city of Lahore, killing at least 69 people and wounding around 300, rescue workers and officials said.The blast occurred in a parking lot at Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park, one of the largest parks in Lahore, said Haider Ashraf, a senior police official in the city. The bomb was detonated within several feet of the swings in a park crowded with families on Easter.Jamaat-e-Ahrar, a splinter faction of the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the blast. Its spokesman, Ehsanullah Ehsan, said in a statement that Christians were the target.It was the third bombing in Pakistan in this month alone, a reminder that even as the military has cracked down on extremists over the past two years, Islamist groups remain a potent threat.The bombing came as large protests were held in other parts of the country to protest the execution in February of the man who murdered a secular politician five years ago. While public opinion has largely been galvanized by attacks on civilians by jihadists, particularly the killing of 150 people at a school in Peshawar in 2014, the protests are a sign that widespread sympathy remains for extremist groups in Pakistan.The Jamaat-e-Ahrar spokesman, Mr. Ehsan, said the bombing was also to give a message to government that it cannot deter us even in their stronghold, Lahore. Lahore, the capital of Punjab Province, is the hometown of Pakistans prime minister, Nawaz Sharif; his younger brother, Shahbaz Sharif, is the chief minister of the province.Even though Pakistani officials rebutted the claim that Christians were the target, a large number of Christian families were in the park because of the Easter holiday, the local news media reported. The 67-acre park has walking paths, as well as rides for children.As the country reeled from this latest spasm of violence, the civilian and military leadership huddled separately to deal with the precipitating sense of crisis. Prime Minister Sharif held a four-hour meeting with his top ministers while Gen. Raheel Sharif, the army chief, who is not related to the prime minister or his brother, directed intelligence agencies to investigate the attack and bring the perpetrators to justice.Victims described a scene of chaos and devastation soon after the blast.I was standing near the roller coaster when the blast occurred, said a 10-year-old boy who gave his name as Usman Ghani, and who was being treated for minor injuries at Shaikh Zayed Hospital. I saw fire afterward. There were a lot of people in the park. It was so crowded that people had to break the boundary wall near the gate to cross over and run away.I wish I hadnt brought my daughter to the park today, said Kamran Bhatti, 34, a frequent visitor to the park. This is the only recreation we can afford for her. What is her fault?He continued: While we were running out of the park, my daughter slipped and rolled over. Shes injured, but I thank my God that we are not crying for a lost child.His daughter, 7, was being treated for an injury to her leg at Jinnah Hospital on Sunday night.Yousaf Masih, 50, who said he is Christian, said: We came to the park after the Easter church services. We brought our food basket along with us, and like the usual outing on our festivals, we were spending our day.There was a lot of rush due to Easter, Mr. Masih said, adding that a majority of the people in that area of the park were Christian. My children were playing cricket when we heard a huge blast on the main gate of the park. It was mayhem. Everyone was running for their lives. On our way out, we saw the body of the suicide bomber in the parking area.Others said security at the park was lax.There was no security, as such, at the gates, said Azhar Shah, 23, a student. The guard sitting at the main gate was not checking anyone.Mr. Ashraf, the police official, said of the park: It was a soft target. Innocent women and children and visitors from other cities have been targeted.The State Department condemned the attack. Attacks like these only deepen our shared resolve to defeat terrorism around the world, and we will continue to work with our partners in Pakistan and across the region to combat the threat of terrorism, it said in a statement.The explosion coincided with violence in other parts of the country as hundreds of protesters took to the streets to condemn the Feb. 29 execution of Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri for the 2011 killing of a governor, Salmaan Taseer. Mr. Taseer had campaigned for changes in the countrys blasphemy laws, saying they were used to persecute religious minorities, but to many in Pakistan, the idea of altering the countrys blasphemy laws is itself criminal, and Mr. Qadri has become a revered figure to his supporters.Protesters clashed throughout the day with police officers in Islamabad, the countrys capital, marching on the main avenues of the city and trying to force their way into the citys red zone, a high-security area that includes the Parliament, the Supreme Court and many diplomatic missions. They set several vehicles, including a fire truck, on fire and damaged public property. The police used tear gas to disperse the protesters, but appeared to be overwhelmed by their numbers. Army troops were called in to secure government buildings.Pakistan has been shaken by a series of attacks this year. A suicide attack on a court in Peshawar was carried out early this month in retribution for Mr. Qadris execution, killing 16. The attack was also claimed by Jamaat-e-Ahrar. Also this month, a bomb left on a bus carrying government employees in Peshawar killed 14.A state of emergency was imposed on hospitals in Lahore after Sundays blast. Private television networks broadcast images of rescue workers and ambulances rushing to the park and ferrying victims to hospitals. Distraught relatives milled about in hospital corridors as the wounded were treated.There was no prior intelligence report about the attack, Muhammad Usman, the district coordination officer in Lahore, told reporters.Mr. Usman also rebutted early reports that Christians had been targeted in the blast. The park belongs to all, he was quoted as saying.Mr. Sharif, the chief minister of Punjab, announced a three-day period of mourning in the province."}

{"text": "Charter Communications is within striking distance of finally capturing its prize.As soon as this week, the cable company could get the green light from federal regulators on its pair of deals  totaling $67.1 billion  to acquire Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. The merger will create a powerful new force in the industry that will dramatically reshape the future of how people gain access to the Internet, watch televisionand much more.Emily Steel, who covers media for The New York Times, and Cecilia Kang, who writes for The Times from Washington about technology policy, have been following the story since it  broke in the summer of 2013.EMILY STEEL: Hi, Cecilia. Its hard to believe that this day is finally coming. Whats the latest that youre hearing from regulators in Washington on the Charter deals?CECILIA KANG: Hello from the seat of government, where corporations come to win hearts at the risk of getting theirs broken. In this case, it looks as if Charter, a small cable company with big ambitions, will find rare success. The Federal Communications Commission shot down two big mergers in the last five years but is about to approve Charters bid for Time Warner Cable and Bright House. The acquisitions will create the second-largest broadband provider, after Comcast, with 19.4 million subscribers, and the third-largest video provider, after Comcast and DirecTV, with 17.3 million customers. The combined company will span 40 states and include big markets such as Los Angeles and New York.The creation of such a giant cable and Internet company upsets consumer advocacy groups, which say a lack of competition has led to increased prices and poor customer service. But the F.C.C. thinks the deal wont harm consumers because the companies dont really compete in the same markets. While Comcast made a similar argument in its failed bid for Time Warner Cable, the F.C.C. was more skeptical in that case because Comcasts big media holdings with NBCUniversal held the potential for a conflict of interest.Charter and Time Warner Cable have also persuaded regulators that together, theyll be able to bring faster broadband to more households.The big focus at the F.C.C. has been on how this deal will affect the fastest-growing area of media: video streaming. Emily, what do people in the media and tech industries think?EMILY STEEL: Streaming has definitely been a hot topic. The big fear is that a gigantic Charter will have both the power and the incentive to hurt rival streaming services. It also could hinder the invention of other new offerings.In the three years since Charter started circling Time Warner Cable, there has been an explosion of new options for cord cutters, who want to ditch their traditional cable subscriptions but keep feeding their TV addictions. HBO and Showtime, for example, both started  la carte streaming services. And Dish Network started a service called Sling TV that offers live and on-demand viewing for about two dozen channels. Those new services are usually cheaper than a typical cable TV offering (like what Charter sells) and also give people more choice to pay for what they want to watch, when they want to watch it. (I tried out Sling to watch my North Carolina Tar Heels in the March Madness college basketball tournament this year.)If Charter is selling traditional cable service, why would it want to ease the way for a new set of competitors? Both Dish and Time Warner, the parent company of HBO, have warned regulators that Charters takeover could alter the future of streaming.How do you expect regulators to address that concern?CECILIA KANG: As a condition of approval, the F.C.C. persuaded Charter to agree to a number of public interest commitments, including a promise that it will treat streaming services fairly. Its possible that Charter will promise not to pressure programmers like Viacom and Disney to withhold shows from companies like Hulu and Netflix, which could siphon viewers away from Charters offerings. Arrangements to withhold programming, known as most favored nation clauses, are common but secret. But the F.C.C. and Department of Justice, which is also reviewing the deal, have made more noise about them in various speeches because they think such deals stifle streaming services by keeping the most popular shows exclusively in the cable bundle.Tom Wheeler, chairman of the F.C.C., has talked a lot about his mission to ensure that nascent media and telecom services blossom during his tenure. After the agency rejected Comcasts bid for Time Warner Cable last April, the F.C.C.s top lawyer said that particular deal would have threatened streaming companies that competed with Comcasts video service.Which raises a question: Why would regulators say yes to Charter but no to Comcast?EMILY STEEL: For one, this deal is not as big. The Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger would have united the countrys two largest cable companies into an entity that controlled as much as 57 percent of the nations broadband market and just under 30 percent of pay television. That would have put a lot of power in the hands of one company that several TV executives already described as a major bully. And while Charters deal has generated its share of critics, the opposition to the Comcast deal was much louder and came from a wider base of lawmakers, public interest groups and big companies like Netflix, Dish and Discovery Communications.Comcast lashed out against its critics, calling some extortionists. Charter, on the other hand, has taken a more conciliatory approach, striking deals with potential opponents, like one in which it promised not to charge access fees to online content companies such as Netflix no matter how much traffic they create. (Charter has a major financial incentive to make the concessions necessary for approval: Time Warner Cable will receive a breakup fee of up to $2 billion if the deal falls apart.)One other interesting point, I think, is the idea that regulators could be using the Charter deal to drive the industry to adopt new business models. Cecilia, what do you think the F.C.C. is hoping to achieve through the merger?CECILIA KANG: This F.C.C. clearly wants to support streaming video services, and that push is seen in so many of its regulatory decisions. Its net neutrality rules  a condition of this deal that will be upheld even if the agencys rules are overturned in federal court  would ensure that Netflix and Hulu are never slowed or blocked by Charter. The F.C.C. hopes that opening up the set-top-box market will allow companies like Google and Amazon to sell devices that blend cable programming with Hulu, YouTube and online video services.Mergers are also used to spur broadband providers to extend service to more customers and offer cheaper plans for low-income households, a provision Charter has already volunteered to adopt. Other commitments could include the promise not to impose data caps or usage-based pricing for broadband customers.And even if the deal gains approval from federal regulators, it has one more hurdle: Regulators in California are also reviewing the merger. But there is little indication it will be blocked by state commissioners.The completion of one merger is near, Emily, but Im sure another big cable, wireless or media merger will have us back here talking again very soon. Until then."}
{"text": "Ted Cruz was naming friends.Seated for an interview inside a stately Midtown Manhattan library, just south of Trump Tower, the Texas senator leaned forward in his chair, ticking off the unlikely coalition drifting his way.There was Jeb Bush, who announced his endorsement in a terse predawn news release, and Mitt Romney, who initially said his support applied only to his voting preference in Utah.Mr. Cruz had swung Mike Lee, his greatest ally in the Senate, nearly a year after his campaign began, and Mark Levin, a conservative radio host who recently made his longstanding admiration on the airwaves official.They are coming to us, Mr. Cruz said. We welcome their support with open arms, but my positions, my policies have not changed.Nor has Mr. Cruzs reputation, particularly.As Mr. Cruz seeks to unite the disparate factions of the Republican Party that are bonded only by their dead-set opposition to Donald J. Trump, a high-wire act is required: welcoming the top ranks of the same establishment he has spent years excoriating while not abandoning the hard-line conservatives who like him in part because of his attacks on party leaders.While the Romney and Bush endorsements drew headlines, what has been just as striking is the sound of silence from the vast majority of Republican elected officials and leading donors. Nearly two weeks after Senator Marco Rubio dropped out of the race, there has been no mass rush to Mr. Cruz, even as he appears to be the last line of defense against a Trump nomination.The decision by so many leading Republicans to remain on the sidelines is all the more notable because it appears inversely proportional to the scale of concern about Mr. Trump. His recent attacks on Mr. Cruzs wife and soaring unpopularity among women, minorities and college-educated voters have left many in the party more convinced than ever that, with Mr. Trump as their standard-bearer, they are churning toward a political iceberg this fall.But this fear has not been enough to coax them in Mr. Cruzs direction.Theyre afraid of Trumps voters and they hate Cruz, explained Senator Lindsey Graham, who has tried to rally his colleagues behind Mr. Cruz. But if I can swallow my pride, they can, too.Part of Mr. Cruzs challenge is that Gov. John Kasich of Ohio remains in the race, providing cover for some Republicans who cannot abide Mr. Trump but cannot bring themselves to support Mr. Cruz.Mr. Graham said he intended to sound out Mr. Kasichs supporters about whether the governor may be willing to join forces with Mr. Cruz.A Cruz-Kasich ticket is the best way we can stop Trump, he said. Its time to think big here.If they will not run together, said Mr. Graham, they at least need to form an alliance in which they divvy up states to not drain votes from each other  something neither seems willing to do. The main thing is weve got to get into the convention with Trump under 1,237 delegates.Yet other top Republican officials are not nearly as dedicated to plotting this or any strategy to deny Mr. Trump a majority before the party gathers in July in Cleveland.Even those who have signaled they are likely to support Mr. Cruz are dragging their feet. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who has spoken favorably of Mr. Cruz, said he would not announce his choice until closer to his states April 5 primary  for maximum impact.Mr. Rubio, who praised Mr. Cruz as the only conservative left in the race after his exit, has been perhaps the most conspicuous holdout. He is one of the few Republican senators who gets along well with Mr. Cruz, and the two have been in touch since Mr. Rubio withdrew from the race.But Mr. Rubio is likely to run again for president in 2020 should Republicans lose the White House this year, and, in making scores of thank-you calls to donors in recent days, he has been discouraged by some party financiers from supporting Mr. Cruz, according to a Republican strategist briefed on the calls.Without Mr. Rubios imprimatur, many of his backers seem disinclined to back Mr. Cruz.Compounding the problem is Mr. Cruz himself. He often portrays this election as akin to 1980, when Ronald Reagan won in a landslide. But he appears to be privately grappling with whether he would be better off playing the 1976 version of Reagan, who carried the banner of unadulterated conservatism against the eventual Republican nominee all the way to the convention, fell short and won four years later.Though Mr. Cruz has adjusted his public tone, calling for party harmony and appealing to our better angels in a moment of political discord, senior Republican officials say Mr. Cruz has made little effort to repair relationships, particularly in the Senate.Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican senator and Mr. Cruzs fellow Texan, privately lobbied Mr. Cruz to attend a Senate Republican luncheon in the Capitol and soothe feelings, according to a Republican strategist briefed on the request. But after a CNN report in which some Republican senators suggested that Mr. Cruz apologize to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, whom Mr. Cruz called a liar on the Senate floor, Mr. Cruzs campaign became irritated and backed off a peacemaking lunch.Mr. Cruz and Mr. McConnell have still not spoken, according to an aide to Mr. McConnell.Im not sure theres anything to apologize for, Jason Johnson, Mr. Cruzs chief strategist, told reporters recently.Mr. Cruzs allies argue his reticence to publicly embrace the establishment is understandable given the success of Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz and the fact that Mr. Cruzs political brand is premised on anti-Washington fervor and conservative purity. But even Republican senators in states that have yet to vote and should favor Mr. Cruz  such as Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska  have not received overtures, according to aides.When party leaders, including Mr. Lee, the Utah senator, lobbied for a so-called unity ticket that would make Mr. Rubio the presumptive running mate for Mr. Cruz, the Cruz campaign demurred.We dont really talk to that many Beltway people, said Jeff Roe, Mr. Cruzs Houston-based campaign manager, when told the idea of a Cruz-Rubio ticket was setting the Beltway ablaze.What could rouse the establishment, and convince leaders that Mr. Trump can be stopped at a convention, is a strong Cruz victory next week in Wisconsin.If he can pull out Wisconsin, I think Cruz draws more interest, said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a longtime Republican strategist.For now, though, Mr. Cole said most in the establishment wing of the party saw little upside in boosting someone they have little regard for, do not think can win a general election and whose prospects they think will be helped little by their endorsement.Why stick your name and your neck out there when you dont think it will make much of a difference? Mr. Cole said.In the interview, Mr. Cruz noted he has been nothing if not consistent.With me, he said, you know what youre going to get."}
{"text": "JERUSALEM   Israels High Court of Justice struck down on Sunday a deal that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reached in December to enable the development of a major offshore natural gas field.The gas trove, called Leviathan, has the potential to transform Israel into an exporter of the fuel, but it has been plagued by delays.The court specifically objected to a part of the agreement between the government and the projects developers, which are led by Noble Energy, that prohibits changes to regulations affecting the project for 10 years.Justice Elyakim Rubinstein, the courts deputy president, said that the government did not have the authority to make such a long-term deal, which would bind its successors, especially when the issue at hand is a matter of real political controversy.The court gave the government a year to work out an alternative solution, but that may lead to further delays in developing the field, which was discovered in 2010.Noble Energy, based in Houston, has already reached preliminary agreements to export gas from Leviathan to Egypt and Jordan. The Obama administration has enthusiastically supported these efforts in the hope that energy ties would help build peaceful relations between Israel and its neighbors in the Middle East.Plans to bring Leviathans gas to market have been slowed by a series of roadblocks, including a decision in 2014 by Israels antitrust commissioner that Noble and its partners would have too much power over the Israeli energy market. That ruling led Mr. Netanyahu to devise a deal under which Noble and its partners would divest part of their Israeli holdings, but now the court has objected to that arrangement.Predictably, the Israeli government reacted with dismay to the court decision.The High Court of Justice decision severely threatens the development of the gas reserves of the State of Israel, Mr. Netanyahu said in a statement. Certainly, nobody has any reason to celebrate that the gas is liable to remain in the depths of the sea and that hundreds billions of shekels will not reach the citizens of Israel.Mr. Netanyahu also said that Israel was seen as a state with excessive judicial interference in which it is difficult to do business.In recent years, discoveries by Noble and its Israeli partners, the Delek Group conglomerate, have helped transform Israel from a country heavily dependent on energy imports to one with a growing natural gas industry. The companies currently operate a field called Tamar, whose gas is used to generate roughly half of Israels electricity. Leviathan is twice the size of Tamar.For many Israelis, however, the benefits of a surging natural gas industry are outweighed by concerns that Noble and its partners were becoming too powerful.The judges chose today to protect the separation of powers and the rule of law in Israel, to halt the limitless recklessness for the benefit of the gas tycoons, and to put up a glowing stop sign in order to defend the public and Israeli democracy, Shelly Yachimovich, a lawmaker from the center-left Zionist Union group, wrote on her Facebook page on Sunday."}
{"text": "To understand the appeal of Donald J. Trump, shift your focus from political pundits (who have repeatedly underestimated him) to stand-up comics.One reason Amy Schumer, Chris Rock and Louis C.K. are among the most trusted figures in popular culture is that they bluntly articulate the dark things people think but dont say. Presidential front-runners have traditionally taken a more diplomatic approach, but Mr. Trump broke the mold, dispensing with scripted speeches while trafficking in insult humor and swaggering provocations. When critics get offended, he defends himself the way so many comics do, railing against political correctness.If Mr. Trumps unorthodox campaign belongs to a stand-up tradition, that may be why David Cross seems unsurprised by that candidates popularity in his new show, Making America Great Again! Pacing deliberately onstage at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Friday, Mr. Cross, wearing jeans and a shaggy beard, described Mr. Trumps intolerant rhetoric and political transgressions not as gaffes but as essential to his success, a more accurate reflection of how a large part of the country feels than what has come before.With the hard-earned cynicism of a veteran comic who understands how candor can be performed, he said that Mr. Trump let the id out of the bottle and that his speeches appealed to those looking for white power rallies  without the guilt.Mr. Cross doesnt get the credit he deserves as a political stand-up. Hes better known as a comic actor (Arrested Development) and an inspired sketch performer (Mr. Show), and his brainy-oddball persona doesnt have the gritty glamour of Bill Hicks or Lenny Bruce. But in the anxious years after Sept. 11, Mr. Cross was stand-ups premier polemicist, releasing two specials attacking Bush-era policies with scathing wit and uncommon force.In eloquent rants, he described New York with none of the romantic uplift employed by television hosts and literary lions. Those buildings were made of tires and skunks, was how he recalled the smell of the aftermath. He merrily ridiculed the self-important gestures made in the name of not letting the terrorists win.I was in New York during Sept. 11, he said, or as I like to refer to it, the week football stopped.Most significantly, Mr. Cross was an early voice of outrage about the federal governments response. When George W. Bushs percentile approval ratings were in the high 60s, Mr. Cross said he could be the nations worst president ever.Released between comedy booms, these albums were hits but also targets of a critical backlash, with Mr. Cross becoming the face of a didactic, patronizing alternative comedy. A review in Pitchfork argued that he had manipulated self-satisfaction, the least funny of all postcollegiate states, into a perfectly valid comedic persona. Hitting similar notes, The New York Press put him on its list of the 50 most loathsome New Yorkers.Mr. Cross, a Georgia native, cut his teeth in the fertile Boston scene (along with Louis C.K. and Marc Maron) before moving to Los Angeles and eventually settling in New York in 2000. He does have a weakness for the easy sneer. But his specials have aged better than those critiques. His unsparing, bracing attacks on Mr. Bush are now closer to common wisdom, and in our fragmented culture, where righteous voices and preaching to choirs are common, Mr. Cross doesnt sound so sanctimonious anymore.Still, the criticism got to him (it even made him stop doing stand-up for a few years) and his subsequent work is slightly more restrained, for good and ill. At his show in Brooklyn, so close to his home that he said he walked to work, his anxiety about his reputation emerged in jokes that now mock hip urbanites (who make up a large portion of his audience) as harshly as right-wingers. A joke in which he considers getting a Muhammad tattoo seemed as though it was about the fear of being killed but pivoted to his real terror: becoming the guy who smugly explains an ironic joke.Mr. Crosss style has also evolved. His earlier work had the rambling quality of a lot of early alternative comedy. While hes still voluble, speaking in complete paragraphs filled with ornamental sentences, his comedy has become tighter, not only dense with jokes but carefully crafted to sandwich more elaborate arguments with hard punch lines. His delivery has shifted from a loping pace to a precision trot interrupted by sudden strategic pauses. I think everyone in here can agree that, he said, with carefully practiced casualness, before pushing the brakes and enunciating each of the following words: Blue Lives Murder.Mr. Cross understands the power of a provocation, and several jokes in the show were intended to make the audience uncomfortable. The most tired ones were shots at religion. (Hes the kind of atheist who describes transubstantiation and then just stares for seconds, waiting for the guffaws.) Mr. Cross was at his best when he turned from making an argument to parodying the opposition, shifting into long monologues of resentment-filled dogma that spiraled into increasing absurdity. His punch lines jabbed and picked apart, but his impressions of Southern good old boys or trendy urbanites were the real steamrollers.Mr. Cross shied away from a sustained rant about Mr. Trump, repeatedly assuring the audience he was almost done talking about him. But the comic screed is a noble tradition, and with so many hedging neurotics in stand-up, a confident voice, even a self-satisfied one, can be a powerful comic tool.His finest comedic arguments emerge from a muffled rage, none more so than his long chunk of material on gun control. Its core was the question always asked after mass shootings: How many children must die before we pass strict gun control laws?Well, Mr. Cross said with can-do pep, Ive crunched the numbers. What followed was a precise answer that I wont give away, a kind of parody of rational choice theory, but what made it resonate was that it managed to be both preposterous and also the most realistic solution to gun violence yet. It was also a vision of political change that, like Mr. Trumps speeches, assumes that most political talk of American greatness is far too rosy.Theres nothing more American, Mr. Cross proclaimed dryly, than standing firm and resolute in the face of rational thought."}
{"text": "CHICAGO   Mayor Rahm Emanuel has informed some city leaders that he has chosen an interim superintendent of police, rejecting three candidates that had been recommended by the police board, as he seeks to repair Chicagos fractured relationship with its police force.Eddie Johnson, the Police Departments chief of patrol, was asked to take the job as interim police superintendent, said Anthony Beale, the alderman for Chicagos Ninth Ward. The selection was reported by The Chicago Sun-Times late Saturday.The choice of Chief Johnson, who is African-American and a 27-year veteran of the force, suggested that the mayor believed an insider was needed to help restore the communitys trust in the department.The job at the helm of Chicagos roughly 12,000 officers, which pays $260,000, is among the toughest in American law enforcement. Chief Johnson would face challenges of rising violence; bruised officer morale; and community relations, particularly with African-Americans, that have been strained by outrage over police misconduct. The move by Mr. Emanuel signaled his disapproval of three candidates who had been presented this month by the Chicago Police Board.Under city ordinance, Mr. Emanuel is required to choose the police superintendent from the slate of recommendations offered by the police board. If he intends to install Chief Johnson in the job permanently, he will have to ask him to apply and request that the board conduct a new search.The board had whittled down a field of 39 applicants to three: Cedric L. Alexander, the chief of police of DeKalb County, Ga.; Anne Kirkpatrick, a former police chief of Spokane, Wash.; and Eugene Williams, a deputy police superintendent in Chicago and the chief of the Bureau of Support Services.It was unclear why the mayor went off script. Kelley Quinn, a spokeswoman, said Sunday that Mr. Emanuel had spent more than three months researching the hiring decision, and that he would be making an announcement about his choice in the coming days.The mayors choice for the next superintendent will be one of the most important decisions he makes, Ms. Quinn wrote in an email.In a separate statement, Ms. Quinn explained Mr. Emanuels decision to reject the three finalists. While each of the finalists had strong qualifications, the mayor did not feel that any of them were the complete package that Chicago needs at this time and thus none were offered the position, Ms. Quinn wrote. The mayor called each of them individually late Saturday to let them know of his decision.The police board said in a statement on Sunday that it had not been notified of any decision. The board will be taking no action until it receives such notification, Lori Lightfoot, the panels president, said in the statement.Chief Johnson would replace the interim superintendent, John J. Escalante, who was not among the finalists, though he did apply.Mr. Beale, the alderman, who is a member of the City Councils black caucus, said he supported the mayors decision. Eddie Johnson knows Chicago, he wrote in an email. He knows the Police Department and the challenges facing our neighborhoods. He is a true leader and will bring the fundamental changes C.P.D. needs right now.Public anger over the use of force by the department has put intense pressure on city leaders since November, when Jason Van Dyke, a white officer, was charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Laquan McDonald, a black teenager. The public release of video footage of the shooting fanned outrage and led to weeks of protests.In the fallout, the Justice Department announced an investigation into the Police Department, and in December Mr. Emanuel abruptly fired Garry F. McCarthy, then the superintendent.Mr. Emanuels choice for superintendent also posed high political stakes for him. He has faced fierce criticism over the police, and some have even called for his resignation.In statements announcing earlier promotions in Chief Johnsons career, the Police Department portrayed him as an officer with vast experience in sometimes difficult settings. He was promoted in December to chief of patrol.Mr. Emanuel is not the first Chicago mayor to circumvent the police board in selecting a superintendent. In 2007, Mayor Richard M. Daley rejected the boards three recommendations and instead named Jody P. Weis, an outsider, to lead the department."}

{"text": "They have been talking with gathering frequency and exchanging texts regularly, with Carl E. Heastie, the State Assembly speaker, firing off messages from his iPhone and Mayor Bill de Blasio responding  painstakingly  on his decidedly more antiquated device.He still uses the phone where you have to press it and go beep beep three times to get to the C, Mr. Heastie said in an interview. I dont get it. I guess thats one place where the mayor and I disagree: our different views of technology.On nearly everything else, especially the state budget that is being negotiated behind closed doors in Albany, the two men, both Democratic leaders from New York City, have presented a united front as they seek to claw back hundreds of millions of dollars that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, also a Democrat, removed in his plan for the state.The ties that bind the mayor of New York City and the speaker of the State Assembly  whose ranks are overwhelmingly dominated by members from the city  have always been strong. But with the distrust between Mr. Cuomos office and City Hall showing little sign of abating, the importance of maintaining that relationship has ballooned for Mr. de Blasio, who is seeking to get more out of the budget deal than a simple restoration of existing funds.As the budget nears its deadline of April 1, city commissioners have been working their way through Albany to make their case for funding to combat homelessness and improve public housing. At the same time, they are also trying to beat back a property tax cap for the city  supported by Republicans in the State Senate  and to thwart a proposal that would give the state veto power over housing projects in the city that use tax-exempt federal bonds.City officials in the state capital have been focusing as well on the concerns of individual Democratic members of the Assembly  partly to please Mr. Heastie  while also laying out their priorities to unions and other allies who can carry that message for them.Its an ongoing discussion with lots of phone calls all the time, said John Kaehny, executive director of Reinvent Albany, an advocacy group. Its not just that City Hall has to make phone calls and push buttons. Theres a high degree of symbiosis.This month, during the mayors most recent visit to Albany, with the always-last-minute budget negotiations finally beginning to percolate, Mr. de Blasio did not meet with the governor or the Senate majority leader, John J. Flanagan, a Long Island Republican, two of the so-called three men in a room who decide the state budget in closed-door meetings. He did spend an hour with Mr. Heastie, the third man.By contrast, the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, a Democrat, met with all three state leaders to push for the citys agenda during her trip to the capital last Monday.State Assembly officials said the message to City Hall had been consistent: that Mr. Heastie had New York Citys best interests at heart, but that he would need time and a little latitude to work with the governor.He asked me, in general, how things were going in terms of budget negotiations, Mr. Heastie said of his conversation with Mr. de Blasio last weekend. I told him it wasnt high time yet.Emma Wolfe, the mayors top political aide, said the conversations between city officials and Mr. Heasties office had been continuous. Its not like we sort of enter in February and March and go to them and say, Hey, guys, what should the inside and outside game be? she said. Thats not the dynamic that we have.Officials with the governors and the mayors offices were quick to point out that irrespective of how often the two leaders had connected personally, their staffs were in regular communication.Indeed, in many ways the budget process this year has been similar to ones in years past, except in one crucial respect: Mr. Cuomos opening salvo, his executive budget, proposed shifting to New York City nearly $500 million in costs for the City University of New York system and requiring City Hall to contribute a larger share of the payments for the federal Medicaid program.Almost immediately, Mr. Cuomo said the changes would not cost the city a penny. More recently, amid a fierce backlash, his top officials conceded it had been a negotiating maneuver. As of Friday, the CUNY cost shifts had been resolved, said Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for the governor, in exchange for the hiring of a management consultant assigned to make the university system more efficient. But Medicaid remained an active issue in the negotiations, much of which seemed predicated on resolving a $15 minimum wage opposed by many Republicans in the State Senate.Doug Forand, a Democratic strategist, said the governors move appeared to be aimed at forcing City Hall and the Assembly to negotiate from a deficit, in the hopes of diminishing their ability to push for other funding.The problem for the city is that there may be fewer interest groups lobbying on behalf of the Medicaid portion than there were groups pushing back on the university cost shifts, said Carol Kellermann, the president of the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission. Its the tragedy of the commons, she said.When all is said and done, said Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the nonprofit Partnership for New York City, the city will depend on Heastie banging his fist on the table, being the champion of specific city asks.The mayor and Mr. Heastie, whose political relationship dates back to Mr. de Blasios tight race for public advocate in 2009, have not always seen eye to eye. When Mr. de Blasio took office as mayor in 2014 and Mr. Heastie was the Bronx Democratic county chairman, they found themselves on opposite sides of the race for City Council speaker. That contest is usually left to county leaders to decide, but Mr. de Blasio injected himself and ultimately prevailed in getting his preferred Council speaker, Ms. Mark-Viverito.But Mr. Heastie and Ms. Wolfe both said there were no lingering resentments. We moved on from that, Mr. Heastie said. I dont think I have any real areas of disagreement with the mayor right now, he said, adding that he remained focused on getting the city the best deal possible. I have to go home, he said.City Hall officials remain confident that their interests will prevail when the final deal is reached, probably in the final days or hours before this weeks deadline.And they were clear about another thing: Mr. Heastie is one of the very few people with whom the mayor texts, so others who have his number should not start trying. Mr. de Blasio does not like to text."}
{"text": "LONDON  There is a huge difference between playing for points and playing friendlies. But in many aspects, the way Uruguay came from two goals down against Brazil to earn a point in a World Cup qualifying was no more surprising than how England, also down two goals, emerged a 3-2 victor in Germany.Uruguay is used to upsetting Brazil, especially when Luis Surez is there to provide the finishing touch, as he did Friday in the 2-2 draw in Recife in northeastern Brazil.Germany, the world champion, is not renowned for giving ground to anyone. It led by two goals against England in Berlin on Saturday before the young English lineup outscored and out-willed Germany in its own stadium.Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy, each with marvelous back-heel improvisations, scored the first two goals for England. Eric Dier, a Tottenham Hotspur defender, then finished the job with a headed goal following a planned corner-kick routine in stoppage time.And yet the top performer during this weekend of comebacks was not a goal scorer. He was Dele Alli, another Tottenham player who is not even 20. He simply took the game away from the Germans with his energy, spirit and ability to keep on taking the game to the opponent, even when his team appeared down and out in Berlins Olympic Stadium.Alli revels in new situations. A year ago, he was in the midfield of the Milton Keynes Dons in the third tier of English soccer. Now he is the midfield creator of a Tottenham team challenging Leicester City at the top of the Premier League.Nothing seems to faze him. The adversity of being two goals down, after scores by Toni Kroos and Mario Gomez, only seemed to rouse young Alli.Yes, the Germans thought the game was won. Yes, the world champion relaxed. And certainly Alli was not alone in the defiant manner with which England responded.It had a core of four Tottenham players  Kane, Alli, Dier and the left back Danny Rose  in the lineup, youthful players selected by the 68-year-old coach, Roy Hodgson.These players, given license to be adventurous at Spurs by Coach Mauricio Pochettino, have stepped straight into the nucleus of Englands national team. Kane, sturdy and always running, surprised everyone with the way he scored. Facing away from goal, he suddenly turned, flicked the ball behind his own back and smashed the ball past Manuel Neuer.Maybe a little dedication to Johan Cruyff, Kane later said on television.Not to be outdone (because nobody has outdone Leicester so far this season), Vardy emerged off the bench after 71 minutes. Three minutes later, with his third touch of the game, Vardy flicked in the second goal using the inside of his heel.Germany was rocking, Englands force was rolling, and seconds from the end, Dier completed the comeback with his header to win the game.No one doubts that Germany will be different, less generous and certainly less easily distracted when the Euro 2016 tournament starts in June. Saturday was the first time that Germany has lost on home turf after leading by two goals, and it also was the first time in 40 years that England has come back to win from a two-goal deficit.There is a precedent  a famous one  for Uruguays thwarting Brazil. In 1950, Uruguay upset Brazil, 2-1, in Rio de Janeiro in the decisive game of the World Cup. The result is one that few will forget.What happened in Recife this weekend was almost to be expected. Douglas Costa knocked in the opening goal for Brazil in the first minute, then after 25 minutes Renato Augusto, who plays for Beijing Guoan in the Chinese Super League scored the second goal.The second half reversed Brazils apparent supremacy. Edinson Cavani was allowed time and space by Brazils David Luiz to volley the first Uruguay goal, and the same defender, David Luiz, languidly let in Surez to notch the tying goal.Surez reacted emotionally, for he had two reasons to. It was his first game for his country after FIFA effectively banned him for 20 months for biting the shoulder of Italys Giorgio Chiellini during the 2014 World Cup, in Brazil.Uruguay Coach scar Tabrez not only recalled Surez at the first opportunity, he gave him the captains armband. So here was a night in Recife when two F.C. Barcelona strikers, Neymar and Surez, led their opposing national teams in a crucial Wold Cup qualifier.Surez celebrated his goal in a way that at first seemed provocative, but later was understood to be so much more. He ran to the sideline where he was handed a T-shirt, which he held to the crowd.The shirt bore tribute to Walter Ferreira, a physiotherapist who put off his own cancer treatment to get Surez fit for the 2014 World Cup.

{"text": "THE casual consumer of campus-related news might be forgiven for assuming that anti-Semitic intimidation is breaking out all over. Where I teach, at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, arguments over a proposed event or demonstration regarding Israel and Palestine appear every few months, and sometimes turn ugly.In 2013, some Jewish students were forced out of a lecture sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine. Just recently, a few members of the same organization broke up a faculty council meeting with demands that included barring Zionists from the campus.In both cases, the culprits were appropriately and unambiguously condemned by the Brooklyn College president, Karen Gould. And while circumstances vary, controversies over the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel, or B.D.S. for short, have taken place recently at Brown, Oberlin, Vassar and the University of California, among others.At private colleges and universities, pressure to suppress pro-boycott activities is usually administered quietly by donors or alumni and rarely makes the news. But at publicly funded institutions, boycott-related arguments often inspire politicians to try to legislate punishment if the school refuses to shut them down.The battle for free speech on campus won two victories last week. First, the University of California rejected part of a draft report by the state regents that explicitly equated anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism in its condemnation of the latter.Second, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has apparently reconsidered his original idea to cut $485 million from the CUNY budget a budget that the Senate Republican majority passed in a surprise session March 14 as a way to send a message to CUNY to take a harder line regarding what it considers to be the universitys anti-Semitism problem.Anti-Semitism is no doubt a problem on many college campuses. And the boycott Israel movement  which has inspired these arguments  is tainted with it. I have long been a vocal B.D.S. opponent at CUNY and helped to found a national organization of academics to fight it, and Ive experienced the nastiness firsthand. Still, as obnoxious as some of its followers can be, the boycott movement on campus is thriving not because of, but in spite of, the anti-Semitism of some of its adherents.Indeed, it is filled with young Jews. The pro-boycott group Jewish Voice for Peace is perhaps the fastest-growing Jewish organization on campuses nationwide. And many liberal Zionists share the movements complaints about the brutality and self-defeating nature of Israels nearly 50-year occupation, even if they believe B.D.S. language and tactics to be counterproductive to the goal of a peaceful, two-state solution  to say nothing of the movements contravention of principles of free expression.This is what happened to CUNY, with that surprise session initiated by Republicans in the State Senate. As was the case with the California regents, a single Jewish organization was behind the anti-CUNY campaign. In California, it was the Amcha Initiative, one of whose founders was quoted in this newspaper over the weekend explaining that B.D.S. is in virtually all of its aspects anti-Semitic. With CUNY, it was the far-right Zionist Organization of America making the same argument. These accusations of anti-Semitism were then magnified by conservative columnists and repeated by the Republican state senators.But contrary to what the state senators claimed, CUNY administrators did not ignore the accusations. They hired two former federal prosecutors to examine the complaints of anti-Semitism and recommend appropriate action. CUNY has also established a working group to go over its policies relating to the boundaries of acceptable speech. Abraham Foxman, the former director of the Anti-Defamation League and an alumnus of CUNY, has praised the universitys handling of these isolated incidents. And, to borrow a phrase, when it comes to anti-Semitism, if Abe Foxman is not worried, Im not worried.Moreover, the notion that the people behind the worst of this behavior are anything but a loud and obnoxious minority is belied by the reality of everyday life on campus. Aside from Facebook and Twitter posts, where anonymity often invites abuse, Ive never heard a single anti-Semitic syllable uttered on any CUNY campus in the dozen years Ive been on the faculty. My classes on Jewish history and culture often discuss extremely delicate questions of Jewish identity without anyone, Jew or gentile, evincing the slightest discernible discomfort. (Well, one traditionally Orthodox undergraduate once called Woody Allen and Philip Roth worse than the goyim.)The notion that politicians can demand that a university prohibit certain types of political speech it finds politically distasteful by threatening its funding not only makes martyrs of those whom it seeks to silence, it also bespeaks a lack of confidence both in its own beliefs and in the value of reason itself.The rabbinic sage Yossi Ben Zimra would recognize these campaigns as so much motzira-making, or malicious gossip. Regarding CUNY, Id call it shameful to see such tactics deployed against so proud and significant an institution in the history of American Jews, and now an invaluable educational lifeline to millions of recent immigrants and hardworking, largely low-income students.By protecting the right to free speech and expression, while simultaneously demanding civility and respectful discourse on all sides, universities can take care of these problems without political threats that undermine the very purpose of the university itself."}
{"text": "You didnt read the fiction of Jim Harrison, who died on Saturday at 78, for plot. You read it for its appetites. Mr. Harrison was our poet laureate of lumbering desire. His books declared: If you arent taking big bites out of whatever life is on offer to you, you are doing it wrong.Mr. Harrison tattooed every available surface, in his prose, with ideas and impressions about almost everything: sex, death, hawks, paperback books, Hawaiian shirts, getting lost in the woods, mustaches, guns, red wine, illness, roast beef sandwiches and long-form love.He wrote about macho guys. (He preferred the word nacho, like the corn chips.) But they were sensitive and easily wounded macho guys, given to pratfalls of every variety. He liked to give the good lines to women. In The Beast God Forgot to Invent (2000), one of his many books of novellas, a woman complains about a central drawback of Manhattan life: Theres no nature in New York, and the closest you can get is an orgasm.Mr. Harrison was a seemingly casual writer; his long sentences flowed like streams. These streams were rocky with wit. I reread his first novel, Wolf (1971), not long ago. Mr. Harrisons hero finds himself driving endlessly across Nevada, and he comments: I see why they test atomic bombs in this state  if they didnt I would, only in more central locations.My favorite Harrison novels remain his early ones: Wolf, A Good Day to Die (1973), Farmer (1976) and Warlock (1981). This might be sentimentality speaking. I read them at an impressionable age, and they meant  and mean  a lot to me.They offered a worldview, suggesting that to live well was to live with curiosity and humor. They spoke a subliminal truth about writers, that the good ones are rarely the pretentious ones.These novels set the tone for his oeuvre. He wrote about men moving through the woods and sometimes across the country, on offbeat personal missions or on the run from heartbreak or misfortune. Emotionally and intellectually, they have many self-inflected wounds to lick.Mr. Harrison was a more cerebral writer than he is often given credit for. In his memoir, Off to the Side (2002), he reads books as if he were shoveling coal into a blast furnace. He wore his erudition with enviable lightness.That memoir is a reminder that Mr. Harrisons nonfiction, to some of us at any rate, is nearly as valuable as his fiction. His essays are collected in two books, Just Before Dark (1991) and The Raw and the Cooked: Adventures of a Roving Gourmand (2001). Both are worth possessing.Mr. Harrison paid a price for his appetites. His suffered from gout, and his essay about it, One Foot in the Grave, collected in The Raw and the Cooked, is probably the finest we have about this malady. This is the kind of pain, he declared, where you limp toward the bathroom calling out for pets that died in your youth.Worse, you have no one to blame but yourself. In bed, after the hysterical removal of the boot, with the foot propped up, he wrote, you stare at this blushing, throbbing appendage and do not say Why me? because you know so poignantly the answer.Mr. Harrisons later fiction and poetry was increasingly concerned with illness and mortality. Not that he didnt try to stay limber. In 1988, when he was 50, an interviewer from The Paris Review asked him if he was beginning to lose his stamina.He seemed to find this question absurd, so he gave an absurd reply. Actually, its increased over what it was 10 years ago, he said. I usually dance a half-hour a day to Mexican reggae music with 15-pound dumbbells. I guess its aerobic, and the weights keep your arms and chest in shape.In a later book, a character thinks, I have certainly rounded third base and am headed for home plate, which is a hole in the ground. But his fiction was never morose.In his most recent book of poems, Dead Mans Float, he remained committed to whatever pleasures were still on offer. He wrote:I knew Mr. Harrison, not well, just a bit. I edited some of his pieces for The New York Times Book Review, when I was an editor there, and once in a while hed call when he was in town.He was a jumbo presence. People gawked at him when he strolled down the street, not because they knew who he was but because they felt they should know who he was. He looked famous.I was at dinner with him once, at a trendy Manhattan restaurant, when he lit a cigarette. This was about a year after the citys smoking ban began. Since he got away with it, diners at surrounding tables quickly lit up, too. Briefly, it was a big, happy, smoky room.Then a waiter came out and made everyone stub out their Marlboros. Except for Mr. Harrison. The waiter brought him a nice ashtray and told him he could keep going. It was hard to say no to anyone who seemed that happy."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump said on Tuesday night that he no longer vowed to support the Republican nominee if it isnt him, despite a loyalty pledge that all Republican primary candidates signed last year.No, I dont anymore, Mr. Trump said at a town hall forum on CNN when prompted by the moderator, Anderson Cooper. No, well see who it is.When Mr. Cooper pointed out that Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Mr. Trumps chief rival for the nomination, had walked up to the line but not crossed it in terms of saying he wouldnt support the nominee, Mr. Trump replied, He doesnt have to support me.The senator  whose wife Mr. Trump threatened to spill the beans about after a super PAC formed to stop his candidacy ran an ad featuring an old photograph of his wife, Melania, a former model  stopped short of saying he wouldnt support Mr. Trump. Instead, Mr. Cruz said that such a situation would not come to pass because he will be the nominee.Gov. John Kasich of Ohio was more explicit, saying that if the nominee is someone who is really hurting the country and dividing the country, then he just wasnt sure. Pressed by Mr. Cooper as to whether he was saying he thinks that is what Mr. Trump is doing, Mr. Kasich declined to elaborate.Last September, the Republican National Committee chairman, Reince Priebus, asked Mr. Trump to sign a loyalty oath at a time when he left open the possibility of bolting from the party and running as a third-party candidate. Mr. Trump said he would sign, so long as all of the other candidates did the same. So they all did.But Mr. Trump, amid intense efforts to derail his march toward the nomination in a race in which he has a large lead among delegates to the Republican National Convention, said at the forum that he did not believe he was being treated fairly.I have tremendous support right now from the people, Mr. Trump said. I have many more delegates than him, he added of Mr. Cruz.I dont want people to do something against their will, Anderson, he said.Mr. Trump also gave a lengthy defense of his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was arrested on misdemeanor battery charges over an episode in which he is accused of grabbing and bruising a reporter speaking with Mr. Trump after a news conference.Shes not a baby, Mr. Trump said of the reporter, suggesting that she had overstated what happened.When Mr. Cooper asked if Mr. Trump had ever apologized for anything, he replied: Oh, wow. I dont know. Ill think. Can I think?He added, I do believe in apologizing if youre wrong. And then conceded, I apologize to my wife for not being presidential on occasion."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Consumer spending in the United States barely rose in February, and inflation retreated. The report from the Commerce Department on Monday also showed that consumer spending in January was not as strong as previously reported, signaling that economic growth remained sluggish in the first quarter.Consumer spending rose 0.1 percent as households cut back on goods purchases after a downwardly revised 0.1 percent gain in January. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of American economic activity, was previously reported to have increased 0.5 percent in January.When adjusted for inflation, consumer spending rose 0.2 percent. Given labor market strength and cheap gasoline, economists speculated that consumption had been hampered by a stock market sell-off at the start of the year that eroded consumer confidence.In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the advance goods trade deficit widened to $62.9 billion in February, from $62.2 billion in January, rising for a fourth straight month as an increase in exports was offset by a gain in imports.Inflation moderated last month. A price index for consumer spending dipped 0.1 percent, after nudging up 0.1 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the personal consumption expenditures price index increased 1 percent; it rose 1.2 percent in January.Excluding food and energy, prices gained 0.1 percent after advancing 0.3 percent in January. In the 12 months through February, the so-called core personal consumption expenditures price index increased 1.7 percent after a similar increase in January.While the data from January and February may overstate any underlying firming, we do think that the trend in core inflation is picking up, said Daniel Silver, an economist at J.P. Morgan in New York.That core index is the Federal Reserves preferred inflation measure and is running below its 2 percent target. The slowdown in the monthly reading came after the Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, recently expressed skepticism over the sustainability of the gains in core inflation measures.Consumer spending last month was held back by a 0.7 percent drop in purchases of goods. Spending on services rose 0.4 percent.Personal income rose 0.2 percent after rising 0.5 percent in January. The slowdown in income growth is most likely temporary as anecdotal evidence indicates that a tightening jobs market is driving up wages.In a third report, the National Association of Realtors said contracts to buy previously owned homes increased 3.5 percent in February to a seven-month high."}
{"text": "Plants are reviving after a long winter, helped along by warming temperatures and increased light.But do plants also remember what to do? Maybe so. In 2014, Dr. Monica Gagliano and colleagues at the University of Florence in Italy decided to see if they could train a plant to change behavior.The researchers chose Mimosa pudica, more commonly known as the touch-me-not, which curls up its leaves in response to physical stimulation. Test plants in their pots were dropped onto foam from a height of about six inches to elicit the flinching response.After repeated exposure with no major harm, the plants no longer recoiled. Even after a month left alone, the plants remembered the falls werent harmful and ignored them. Dr. Gagliano, now at the University of Western Australia, concluded from the experiment that plants could learn long-lasting behaviors, sort of like memories.But a review published last month in Science Advances suggests that one can look at it another way as well: the mimosa pudica could be learning to forget. Peter Crisp, a molecular plant biologist at Australian National University and author on the review, suggested that plants forget to flinch when it turns out that the threat does no harm. Forgetting has a purpose, Dr. Crisp and his colleagues say: It allows plants to save energy."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  What briefly appeared to be a potential bidding war for Affymetrix, a genetics analysis technology maker, fizzled out on Monday after the company chose to stick with a takeover bid from Thermo Fisher Scientific over a higher bid from a Chinese-backed suitor.In a statement, Affymetrix reiterated its support for the $14-a-share offer from Thermo Fisher that it accepted in January.Hours later, Origin Technologies, a shell company financed by the Chinese private equity firm SummitView Capital, withdrew its offer of $17 a share.Last week, Affymetrix delayed a meeting on the Thermo Fisher transaction after Origin, a shell company run by executives of another genetics analysis company, raised its 11th-hour takeover bid to $17 a share, from $16.10 a share.If Origin had won, its executives would have merged Affymetrix with their own company, Centrillion Technology Holdings.But after studying the new bid, Affymetrix said it still had concerns about Origins offer.In particular, Affymetrix said that it was worried about the ability of Origins financial backer, SummitView Capital, to finance the offer. Moreover, Affymetrix said that it was worried about any review of the transaction by a government panel that examines deals for national security issues.Ultimately, Affymetrix concluded that Thermo Fishers bid, while $3 a share lower, remained the superior proposal.The board is firmly committed to maximizing value for our stockholders, Frank Witney, Affymetrixs chief executive, said in a statement.Thermo Fisher said in a statement on Monday that it was confident its deal would be approved by Affymetrix shareholders.The president of Origin, Wei Zhou, said that he was disappointed about the decision. Origin also complained that it was asked, during discussions with Affymetrix, to place hundreds of millions of dollars in an American escrow account by Monday, a demand Origin deemed unrealistic.We disagree with Affymetrixs assessment of the perceived risks of our proposal, Mr. Wei said in a statement. It is an unfortunate outcome.A vote on the Thermo Fisher bid is scheduled for Thursday."}
{"text": "PRINCETON, N.J.  A well-known computer hacker who goes by the name of Weev said he was behind a wave of anti-Semitic, racist fliers that appeared on printers at more than a dozen college campuses last week.Covered in swastikas, the fliers, which seemed to appear spontaneously on printers, including those at Princeton University, mentioned the struggle for global white supremacy.Weev is the alias of Andrew Auernheimer, who in 2010 was part of a group of hackers that discovered a security loophole on AT&Ts servers and gained access to the data of 114,000 customers. Mr. Auernheimer was initially convicted of identity fraud and conspiracy to access a computer without authorization, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.Mr. Auernheimer said in an interview on Monday that he sent the fliers to every publicly accessible printer in North America. He said he did not specifically target college campuses.The fliers directed readers to The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website. Mr. Auernheimer said free speech concerns were behind his printing spree. My motivation is this: White cultures and only white cultures are subject to an invasion of foreigners.The debate comes at a time of heightened awareness about speech on campus. Black student movements at many campuses broke out this school year, protesting what students saw as the continuing legacies of racism. Last week, the University of California became the first public university system to adopt an official stance condemning anti-Semitism on their campuses.After the fliers appeared on Princeton University printers, the administration promised to try to block any further messages.Some leaders of the black protests here said they saw a discrepancy between the universitys response to the fliers and what they saw as racism against black students in the past.Almost a year ago, after Urban Congo, a student percussion group, performed on campus in loin cloths, which many on campus found offensive, the universitys president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, sent an email to the student body that affirmed the schools commitment to free speech.He reiterated that on a trip to India last week, when he told the Indian Express, We think its very important for people be able to say what it is they want to say even if its offensive to the government or offensive to some of the other people on campus.Asanni York, a member of the Black Justice League, an activist group that led a sit-in in November that called for the removal of President Woodrow Wilsons name from the campus because of his racist positions, said the universitys response to the fliers differed from past stances. When it was happening to black students, it was a matter of free speech, he said. Now that its happening to white, Jewish students, its something else. There seems to be no conflation of hate speech and free speech now.A Princeton spokeswoman, Min Pullan, said the fliers were not a question of free speech. External messages infiltrating our campus is a completely different matter. They are not two things that can be compared, Ms. Pullan said.In addition to Princeton, the messages appeared at the University of California, Berkeley; Smith College; Brown University; the University of Massachusetts, Amherst; and Mount Holyoke College, among other places.Many university printers allow printing from outside their computer networks. Mr. Auernheimer said he did not hack into the printers, but activated them using remote access.In response to the fliers, universities have notified the police and begun to conduct investigations, but it was unclear if Mr. Auernheimer broke any laws. DePaul University in Chicago, for instance, has turned off remote printing.On Monday morning, anti-gay and transgender fliers appeared on printers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Mr. Auernheimer said he was not involved with them."}
{"text": "I see that the Wall Street Journal editorial page has risento the defense ofHouse Speaker Paul Ryans relatively muted response to Trumpism, and what theyve come up with is quite  revealing. In my deliberately tartcritique of Ryan and the rest of the G.O.P. leadership, I suggested that he and other prominent conservatives were taking a first, change nothing; second, do nothing approach to the challenge of Trumpism, and essentially lying still and hoping the danger would pass over. The Journals counter-argument is a straightforward endorsement of exactly that approach: Trumpism too shall pass, the editorial avers, and in the mean time the important thing is to maintain the purity of Journal-approved conservatism, and to refuse any aid and comfort to all those deviationists and splittists who think that the party might not have exactly the right economic agenda for the voters and the times.To #NeverTrump conservatives, then, the Journal offers at best an eyeroll at their passion; the important thing, now and always, is to be #NeverReformConservatism.Do I exaggerate? Lets work our way through the editorial, which defends the House Speaker against a cast of conservative intellectuals who dont like Mr. Ryan because he continues to believe in the Ronald Reagan-Jack Kemp vision of a tax-reforming, free-market GOP that focuses on economic growth.This descriptionis, to begin with, absurd, since if the cast of intellectuals they have in mind is larger than just yours truly  though if I may be a little immodest, I do believe that Im the primary target of the pieceit presumably includesfigures like Yuval Levin and Jim Pethokoukis, who between them have written more words in praise of Ryan over the years than I can count but I digress.These nefarious intellectuals, the Journal continues, would love to volunteer Mr. Ryan for a kamikaze political mission that leaves someone else to pick up the rubble in 2020.Thats because were scheming to replace the pure faith of Kemp and Reagan witha policy mix to address income inequality and promote redistribution  rather than aiming for faster growth (again not quitean accurate description but what do you expect from an editorial too smug to even name the people itscriticizing?), an agenda which Marco Rubio supposedly went all-in forthis year (never mind that his tax plan alsocatered heavily to the Journals ides fixes and his Kempism on immigration clearly helped keep him from the nomination), and which we hope to impose on the party as a whole once wevesent Ryan spiraling into the U.S.S. Donald Trump.But Ryan is toosmartfor our machinations:Mr. Ryan is doing fine on his own  The Speaker hasnt hesitated to condemn Mr. Trumps bad ideas on the merits as they arise, including his Muslim travel ban. But Mr. Ryan also has other obligations, not least protecting the GOP from larger damage this election year.Start with his role as chairman of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, which could be contested for the first time in decades. Hes officially neutral, and hell undermine his credibility and impartiality if he joins the never-Trump cliqueespecially when the Trump campaign is already warning of riots and building a stabbed-in-the-back narrative if their man doesnt get the nomination.If Mr. Trump is the nominee, then Mr. Ryan must defend his partys best interests. This means above all protecting the House majority that polls show a Trump nomination could imperil. If Mrs. Clinton is elected President and Chuck Schumer runs the Senate, a GOP House is the only defense against a policy repeat of 2009-2010. Mr. Ryan cant simply write off the GOP nominee and the millions of votes Mr. Trump has won.The House GOPs role will also be crucial if Mr. Trump wins in November. The businessman has no fixed principles we can detect, and a GOP Congress would have to steer him away from his worst instincts on trade, immigration and isolationism.This is, I must say, some ripelydelusional stuff. Ryan has to appear neutral because Trump is threatening riots? Im old enough to remember when the Journal editorial page opposed appeasement! Ryan shouldnt risk any kind of rupture because if Trump is the nominee aRepublicancivil warmight cost the G.O.P.the House? Trump as the nominee is itself the thing that might cost the GOP the House!Ryan should stand ready to steer a President Trump away from his worst instincts? I mean, there isnt going to be a President Trump  but if there were, what does it say about the Journals editorial page, allegedly a bastion of liberty and cosmopolitan conservatism, that it wants the heir of Kemp and Reagan to keep his options open and his hands undirtied with #neverTrumpism, just in case he might get the chance to help anilliberal race-baiting violence-abetting war crimes-endorsing demagoguepass, I dunno, the biggest supply-side tax cut in the history of the Laffer Curve?What it says is that the Journal has its eyes on the real enemy here. Say what you will about Trumps protectionist Bush lied, people died white identity politics,at least he didnt endorse a larger child tax credit:The irony is that many of the same pundits now demanding that Mr. Ryan become their sword against Mr. Trump also praised the New Yorker last summer for his challenge to GOP orthodoxy. These former Trump apologists claimed the GOP should absorb his rage against the status quo. Instead of income-tax rate cuts, get behind family-friendly tax credits. Make peace with the entitlement state. Restrict trade and immigration allegedly to lift blue-collar wages. Alas for these would-be king-makers, Mr. Trump doesnt take much advice.Projection is a remarkable thing. For the record:The early anti-anti-Trumpism of certain reform conservatives (my ownand to some extentothers) largely consisted of comparing Trump to George Wallaceand wishing for a Nixon,and the adaptationist advice we gave was entirely directed at other Republican politicians, not the Donald. Meanwhile as Trumps demagoguery escalatedit was the Journals longtime fellow travelersin the supply-side movementwho explicitly warmed to him, and its the Journal itself, in this very editorial, that still seems hopeful that Speaker Paul Ryan can write amazing bills for President Trump to rubber-stamp.Alas for these would-be king-makers  well, you know.Then, finally, we have this:The Trump insurgency has a long way to play out, and someone else could still win the GOP nomination. But whatever happens, Mr. Ryan and his political allies will have to limit the policy and political damage. That means preserving a vision of the GOP as a pro-growth, reform party that is inclusive and meets the challenges of the current era. Mr. Ryan knows how to do that better than his critics do.In other words: Do nothing, change nothing, and hope Trump simply does his destructive work and passes on. And if the party is reduced to actual rubble in theprocess, well, the importantthing is that the purity of a policy vision from thirty-five years ago has been preserved in its pristine, handed-down-from-heaven form.The best that can be said of this strategy is that it aspires to follow the fourth path for G.O.P. elites that David Frum (if I may quote a splittist even more defective in his interpretation of Reaganism than the reform conservatives) laid out in his essay on the Republican Partys rendezvous with Trumpism; it redefines political victory to just mean what we have, we hold, and treats the presidency as one of those things that is good to have but not a must-have, especially if obtaining it requires uncomfortable change. Better to reign in the House, in this theory, than to ever compromise your way to something more; better to hunker down and hope to live through Trumpism than to sully the purity of supply-side ideas and donor priorities with anything that might pander to allthe lucky duckies in the government-addicted 47 percent.But even that gives the Journals vision too much credit, because a do nothing/change nothing/let Trump stomp around approach isnt even a good strategy for holding the House of Representatives, let alone the Senate (and farewell and adieu to the Supreme Court, farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain ).No: Its only a good strategy if your primary obsession isnt the actual fate of conservatism, but your own power and influence within whatever rump remains.Which is why theres only one answer to the Journals strangebriefagainst reform conservatism, its insinuations against all thoseunnamed intellectuals (hi!)who want to undermine Paul Ryans political position and conservatisms future for the sake of a narrow ideological agenda: Physician, heal thyself."}

Some had changed their lives because they were no longer happy in their chosen careers, while others simply needed a change or were driven by a new-found passion.We asked our readers to tell us how they had reinvented themselves. As usual their stories did not disappoint. Here are a few of our favorites, from a woman traveling the country as a volunteer to the late-in-life rabbi to the 70-year-old yoga instructor.From Mailman to TeacherUpon retiring from a 30-year career as a humble mailman, I began volunteering in my granddaughters school. I quickly found that I really, really liked working with kids, and I spent a year training with Americorps as a reading tutor for struggling students. This training has given me an encore career as a substitute special-education assistant in the public schools. Its joyful, very challenging and immensely satisfying, maybe even rejuvenating. Compared with my old days, as Bob Dylan says, I was so much older then, Im younger than that now.'Frank Robertson, SeattleThe Professional VolunteerAfter a 45-year career as an administrative assistant, most of that time as a single parent, I would have loved to retire, but without adequate financial resources, what could I do? It it was time to be creative.I received a call from friends saying they had found a a small college in Sitka, Alaska, where the administration welcomed volunteers, offering free room and board. I began to rethink retirement. After all, all I needed do was get there!It was a full calendar year before I was ready. In July, 2005, I retired.  Feeling like Joan of Arc, I drove out of my driveway on my way to Alaska and never looked back.I found that I was welcomed by any organization I approached to help, that college in Alaska, Heifer Ranch in Arkansas, Menaul School in New Mexico, a wildlife refuge in Florida, plus many others. I have traveled the entire country on a fixed income, getting out and giving back, always receiving more than I contribute, making many new friends in the process.Barbara M. Traynor\nSlingerlands, N.Y.The Later-In-Life RabbiAfter having a successful career as a screenwriter for 25 years, I decided to become a rabbi. I entered rabbinical school at age 54 and it took nine years for me to graduate. Today, at age 66 I am one of eight rabbis at Wilshire Boulevard Temple, the biggest and oldest synagogue in Los Angeles.Susan Nanus\nLos AngelesThe Lawyer Who Became a ChaplainAfter 40 years working as an attorney, I retired from the law in 2014 to enter a six-month chaplaincy internship program at Brigham and Womens Hospital. This led to volunteering as a chaplain at Boston Medical Center for six months and then a six-month chaplaincy internship at Boston Medical Center. I was later hired by Boston Medical Center as a per diem chaplain to help out on the weekends and one day a week.The chaplaincy work is intense, typically comforting patients and families whose lives have changed dramatically and precipitously. As a 70-year-old, I feel incredibly fortunate to be able to engage the world in this way.Bill Crane\nBostonThe Financially Savvy ActressIn 2008, I graduated college with a degree in drama and boarded a plane to the Philippines as a cast member on the international tour of Cinderella, the musical. While performing in Asia, however, the American economy was in the midst of a meltdown. So, by the start of 2009, I was back in New York City, a young, recently unemployed actress at the height of the financial crisis.I dove deep into personal finance, learning as much as I could. I sat at the back of the shows tour bus every evening, plugging my daily expenses into spreadsheets. I studied investment principles while taking the subway home after late-night restaurant shifts.\nAs I began to share the tips and tricks I had uncovered with peers, I stumbled upon an eager audience: Regular people were struggling to get a grasp on their money, lost in the jargon and obscurity of traditional financial institutions and media.I now use my love of theater and storytelling to teach young audiences how to leverage the powerful tools of personal finance and entrepreneurship to build a life on their own terms.

Im now 53 years old and in my second year of graduate school studying for a masters degree in clinical mental health counseling.Reading articles, writing papers and engaging with my much-younger peers has invigorated my mind and energized my desire for my soon-to-be new vocation. While many of my peers are trekking to work, Im in my jeans and sneakers making my way to classes with plenty of caffeine and snacks as I plow through my coursework. Frankly, its hardly work to me. Rather, its just part of a journey of not only reinvention but rediscovery of who I am and what I care about. Its taken me nearly 30 years but Im getting there!Elena Yee\nProvidence, R.I.The 70-Year-Old Yoga InstructorI retired from a job with the state of N.Y. about 15 years ago. At the time, I had been practicing yoga for about 20 years. I was offered an opportunity to teach at a senior center in the area and agreed to do it. I based my classes on what my teachers had been teaching me over the years. About seven years ago, I began training to be a yoga teacher at the age of 70. That was very challenging for someone who had taken her last college course many years earlier. I was the oldest person in my class to complete the training.Today, I teach about five classes a week, some at my home where I have transformed my former dining room into a small studio. Most of my students are older and have some limitations physically and I try to accommodate my students needs. This new career brings me great joy and satisfaction. I consider myself to be a very lucky woman!Claire Malone\nDelmar, N.Y.A New Career Working With SeniorsAfter 25 years of working in financial services, I am now the executive director of an assisted living community. When the job market for financial executives became more challenging during the recession, I looked around for a back-up plan.I found assisted living after helping a friends mother who was sick. After helping her, I volunteered at a local assisted living. I loved working with seniors! I got my masters degree in gerontology and started a position as business director of an assisted living community within a few months of each other. In 2013, I was promoted to executive director of our assisted living community. Every day is a good day. I love what I do and I think it shows.Betsy Connolly\nWayland, Mass."}
{"text": "NEW ORLEANS  One of the benefits when people think that you are dead is that you do not have to attend social occasions. This is how Arthur Kern sees it, though he has been so detached from local art circles for so long that he was unaware that some of his former colleagues had assumed the worst.But since his retirement as a Tulane University art professor in 1996  and for many years before that  the reclusive Mr. Kern has been working quietly in his basement studio, sculpting exquisitely grotesque bodies and surreal horses out of fiberglass, filling up his shelves and mantels and a large homemade storage shed in the backyard. Few were aware he was working at all. With the exception of a small show in Lafayette, La., in 2005, Mr. Kern, 84, has not put his work on display for decades.That changed on March 19, when Arthur Kern: The Surreal World of a Reclusive Sculptor, a major retrospective of his work, began at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art here in New Orleans, his first solo show since the 1970s. The exhibition, which runs through July 17, is being curated by John Berendt, the author of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil and a part-time New Orleans resident.What I loved about it was not just the sculpture but the sculptor himself, said Mr. Berendt, who encouraged Mr. Kern to consider an exhibition after he heard about his work from a friend who had heard about it from one of Mr. Kerns cousins.Mr. Kern, who had already been mulling what to do with his lifes work, agreed. Sort of.I wasnt sure I really wanted a show, he said in an interview at his modest but sculpture-filled house. Im still not, to tell you the truth.If this all came about somewhat unintentionally, so did much of Mr. Kerns artistic career. He grew up in New Orleans, drawing and painting seriously but not exactly consumed with ambition, at one point during an interview comparing the urge to create art to having a disease.I was not all that gung-ho about being an artist, said Mr. Kern, a slight and soft-spoken man with a gray thumbprint of a mustache. It just happened to be something I did all the time.In the late 1950s, after a couple of years of military service, he went to work as a designer at a flooring company in Pennsylvania. He was good at it, and he dryly joked that other artists would envy how widely his work had been seen, though it had mainly been viewed beneath shoes in elevators and office buildings.Still, it was here where Mr. Kern was introduced to epoxies that were left as samples by traveling salesmen. He began using epoxy to add texture to his artwork  later turning to polyester resin, which is cheaper and, as it goes into boat building, easy to find. During his years in the flooring business, Mr. Kern never stopped painting, displaying his work in solo and group shows, including as part of a 1962 group exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.But after he left Pennsylvania to teach art at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in the late 1960s, Mr. Kern destroyed virtually all of his paintings and drawings. Though he would teach painting for the next three decades, he devoted his private time exclusively to sculpture.Most of his work is still molded out of polyester resin in a process similar to old-fashioned bronze casting. All of the sculptures feature either humans or horses.Hes chosen forms that go back to the early cave paintings, said Bradley Sumrall, the chief curator for the Ogden Museum, who compared Mr. Kerns work to pieces ranging from ancient Chinese statuary to Luis Jimenez sculptures to steampunk art.We went wild over it, he continued, recalling his first visit to Mr. Kerns house. As someone whos worked in the art world for 20 years, I was shocked that hed never come up in conversation.Some of the works feature the human figure, often with some macabre distortion or a portion peeled away to expose an eerily lifelike eye underneath. A large room of the exhibition is dedicated to the horse sculptures, some life-size, some purse-size, all surreal variations on a small horse model he made in the early 1970s because, he said, one day I decided now Im going to make a horse.Perhaps most striking are the strange contraptions that look like standing spotlights, but in place of the bulbs, there are faces, distorted by transparent but thick molded lenses. Depending on where you stand, the face behind the lens looks different, just as you would look different to the face inside as you moved around to look at it. Though Mr. Kern is stubbornly resistant to interpretation, he eventually volunteers an idea about these.I can never get into somebody elses brain or their experience, he said. We are all isolated in that sense in our own worlds.It is fair to say that Mr. Kern has been more isolated than most, having long ago decided that divorcing myself from everyday life would allow me to let things happen. He did not show and did not sell, except a piece here and there, and did not hire an assistant, preferring to work alone in his dark studio with his bizarre tools: reconfigured cheese graters, kitchen knives and dental instruments.Though Mr. Kern is fine with the term hermit, it could be somewhat misleading; he may have withdrawn from the art world, but he has a wife of 60 years, three daughters and a friendly manner. He also has a cousin in town, who several months ago happened to have photographs of Mr. Kerns work lying on her coffee table, where they were spotted by her friend Dr. Brobson Lutz, a physician in New Orleans with a keen appreciation for the uncommon.Dr. Lutz is a friend of Mr. Berendts, and several days later, they were visiting Mr. Kerns house. Eager museum officials soon followed, and now Mr. Kern is having to decide how he is going to make it through the next few weeks.A lot of the things that are going on, and what will go on, are the very things I tried to escape from before, he said, apparently referring to the interview he was giving at that very moment. Im 84 years old and I have never given a talk about my work."}
{"text": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia  On a recent weekend excursion out of the city, I stopped for coffee at a cluster of roadside shops selling refreshments for travelers heading to the jungle-shrouded highlands that form the spine of Malaysia. A young man was sweeping the small yard outside the outbuilding that housed the restrooms; he was the janitor and handyman, he said, but he was wary when I tried to strike up a conversation.He was from Bangladesh, he told me, and had been in Malaysia for three years. He was called Yunus, but there was no way I could tell if that was his real name.During the rest of my weekend trip, I noticed how many immigrant workers there were in the countryside, as accustomed as I am to seeing them in the capital city. Theyre on construction sites, in factories and on huge palm oil plantations. But most Malaysians will encounter those who work in the lower ends of the service industry, waiting tables in cheap restaurants or, in Yunuss case, cleaning restrooms.These immigrants tend to be found in what the locals call 3D jobs: dangerous, dirty and difficult. In short, jobs that few Malaysians nowadays are willing to do.Workers from Malaysias lower-income neighbors  Indonesia, Vietnam, Nepal, Myanmar and, increasingly, Bangladesh  have become ubiquitous here, yet they remain largely disconnected from the rest of society and have generally been absent from any discussion of national identity. But a recent government communiqu has pushed them into the limelight and forced Malaysians to confront, with unusual frankness, the deep-seated prejudices that some hold against low-skilled workers from abroad.Malaysias foreign work force consists of just over two million legally employed workers together with an estimated two million more who are undocumented (out of the countrys total population of about 30 million). Many Malaysians feel that the slowing economy is unable to support such numbers, and express fears of an immigrant-fueled crime wave.Despite these concerns, the government last month announced a plan to bring in 1.5 million more workers over the next three years from Bangladesh alone. Almost immediately, public debate of the issue, which had been simmering for some time before the announcement, was reignited in spectacular fashion, dominating headlines and chatter on social media.One of the most prominent  and openly xenophobic  voices opposing the program, which was agreed on with the government of Bangladesh, was a group called Pertubuhan Rapat Malaysia, which held a news conference to warn of the dire consequences of admitting such an influx of foreign workers, from serious crime to disease and terrorist attacks akin to those committed by the Islamic State.It has become a norm for them to rape local women, the organizations president, A. Rajaretinam, said. He went on to accuse foreign workers of spreading disease and conquering everywhere.This prompted a flurry of responses, notably from womens and migrants advocacy groups like the Womens Aid Organization and Tenaganita, which condemned racism toward foreign workers and highlighted the risk of xenophobic attacks. But these groups, too, were firmly opposed to the governments plans. They want instead for the government to give legal status to undocumented workers already here. Labor organizations like the Malaysian Trades Union Congress argued for the protection of jobs for locals, rather than employing foreigners at lower wages.In a matter of days, the government reacted by freezing the recruitment of foreign workers, including those from Bangladesh, while promising a review of employment policies. But by then, the issue was firmly in the public domain, engendering further arguments about how Malaysia treats its foreign workers.For city dwellers here, one of the most pressing concerns is crime, particularly violent crime like armed robbery and rape. Crimes that involve foreign workers command special attention. The recent arrests of six men from Myanmar, accused of killing two Bangladeshi workers who refused to pay extortion money and dumping their mutilated bodies in the jungle, was just one recent example of the type of news item that tends to get amplified so that foreign workers seem perpetually to play the role of dangerous outsiders.Yet government statistics from 2013 showed that only 1 percent of crime in Malaysia was committed by foreigners. And a World Bank report from the same year found that increased immigration actually tended to reduce most types of crime.Recent vigilante attacks on foreigners accused of crimes have begun to stir a more robust defense of the rights of foreign workers, with the immigrant-rights group Tenaganita taking a lead in proposing tough regulations on the agents and intermediaries responsible for bringing in workers from abroad. The group is also lobbying for educational programs for those already here.In a widely shared Facebook post, a student at the private Sunway University told about  his friendship with an Indonesian cleaner on campus. He described her difficult journey to Malaysia, the 12-hour shifts she worked and what life was like on her minimum-wage salary. It caught attention as a rare example of a Malaysian reaching across social and cultural barriers to form an empathetic link with a foreign worker.All this focus on migration and labor suggests that Malaysia is beginning to look harder at itself as the maturing, middle-class country it aspires to be  even if, for now, more liberal attitudes are in a minority. As I found in my rather stilted conversation with Yunus, a lack of trust and a huge gulf still divide foreign workers from Malaysians."}
{"text": "At a preview of the new American Museum of Natural History exhibition Dinosaurs Among Us, scientists gave a tip of the hat to Thomas Henry Huxley, the man who proposed in the 1860s that dinosaurs never really vanished from Earth. Most did go extinct, but their evolutionary legacy lives all around us. They are birds, all 18,000 species of them.While Charles Darwins book of books, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, was still in print in 1859, Huxley, a lecturer in paleontology and natural history in London, wrote a favorable review and became a convert to Darwins theory. In a debate the next year, Huxley got the better of the bishop of Oxford, and became known thereafter as Darwins bulldog. He was also the first in a long line of Huxleys who distinguished themselves in science and the arts.A few years later, Huxley enlisted Archaeopteryx, a fossil specimen found in a Bavarian limestone quarry, in his defense of Darwin. He was struck by the specimens many reptilian features; but for a feather in the fossil, it would probably have been misidentified as a reptile. In a report in 1867, Huxley established the evolutionary relationship of birds and reptiles, citing 14 anatomical features that occur in birds and reptiles alike, but not in mammals.Archaeopteryx was one of those missing links in the fossil record that Darwin worried was a weakness in this theory of evolution. Huxley called attention to the feathers and wishbone of this early bird and the long bony tail of a reptile. This was a species in transition.Why has it taken so long to recognize that Huxley had almost certainly been right about the origin of birds from some meat-eating theropod dinosaurs?Mark A. Norell, the chairman of the division of paleontology at A.M.N.H. and curator of the exhibition, had long been a staunch proponent of a dinosaur-bird link. A lot of evidence amassed over the last two decades, especially the numbers of feathered dinosaurs found in China, moved paleontologists to organize the exhibition as a kind of victory lap.I think this is really going to shake up the way people think of dinosaurs, Dr. Norell said.Most ornithologists, though not completely won over, had already ceased raising blanket objections to the dinosaur-bird link. They seemed at a loss to conceive of alternative explanations for the gathering evidence, paleontologists say.The slow evolution of the practice of paleontology itself was another reason for the delay in recognizing Huxleys insight. For the rest of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, the big game of fossil hunting was the bigger and more bizarre dinosaurs that drew people to museums. Expeditions to remote lands widened the search to nearly all continents, piling up skeletons faster than could be analyzed in depth.Roy Chapman Andrews became the real-life Indiana Jones in the 1920s, bringing back from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia a variety of new dinosaur species and the first dinosaur eggs. If only he had found feathered dinosaurs then and there, paleontologists say, the dinosaur-bird link might have been recognized much sooner. That was not to happen until the end of the century.By that time, the field work of fossil hunters remained important, but only as the first step in discovery. For example, in 1964, John H. Ostrom of Yale University saw a birdlike claw sticking out of the ground in Montana. He named the dinosaur Deinonychus, or terrible claw. But it reminded him of Huxleys evolutionary insight, leading Dr. Ostrom to link birds to new generations of dinosaur research.In the last two or three decades, biological disciplines have joined dinosaur studies, applying tools capable of transcending the terrible claw limitations of fossilized skulls and bones. Geologists once dominated the field, Dr. Norell said, but now so many of us could be called paleobiologists.Also, thousands of fossils with feather imprints have been discovered in Liaoning Province in northeastern China in the last 15 years, Dr. Norell said. Birds are the only feathered creatures alive today, but 150 million years ago, early birds and dinosaurs of all shapes and sizes came with feathers, not necessarily for flight. Feathers, museum researchers said, are one of the most useful skin coverings that ever evolved for insulation or mating display as well as gliding or powered flight.Paul C. Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist, has analyzed many recent Chinese fossils of animals that had lived more than 100 million years ago that were found in lake bed sediments.Huxley was a brilliant anatomist, Dr. Sereno said. Some of the first birds from the Chinese site look just like Archaeopteryx. This time, the dinosaur-bird transition has become ascendant.So what is there not to like about evolution if it indeed accounts for the few surviving dinosaurs transformed into flocks of birds? Monstrous dinosaurs may captivate first graders, who thrill at being scared at a safe distance in time.They may also draw comfort from knowing the eating habits (carnivore or herbivore) of dinosaurs  their know-it-all grown-ups cant even pronounce their names. Need there be more reason for a fascination with strange and mighty dinosaurs when you are little in a big world?From my back porch in the country, I hear crows squawking high in the trees. Crows are smart, clever enough to pry open garbage cans down the road, if raccoons had not gotten there first  which might account for their squawking. Some birds, like blue jays at the feeder, seem to enjoy chasing off chickadees and sparrows.Better to be hearing the bullying jays or cardinals singing their vespers, however, than to have a fearsome T-rex peering in at you through your upstairs windows at daybreak, ready for breakfast."}

{"text": "The closer Donald J. Trump draws to winning the Republican presidential nomination over opposition from party leaders, the more his detractors ask: How can this happen?Theres no singular answer.One part of the explanation lies in the modern evolution of presidential competition, another in the special talents of Mr. Trump, and a third in the contours of the 21st-century Republican Party.Today, voters across the United States take their influence over presidential nominations for granted. As recently as 1968, however, just 15 nominating contests were held, in which the rank-and-file selected convention delegates.The eventual Democratic standard-bearer that year, Vice President Hubert Humphrey, didnt enter a single primary. He didnt have to; he enjoyed the support of party leaders who controlled the Chicago convention.But that acrimonious gathering made clear that voters wanted a greater say, and both parties gave it to them. By 1980, they each conducted more than 35 nominating contests. Now, nearly every state holds either a primary or a delegate-selection caucus.As a result, precinct captains in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina have more influence over Republican and Democratic nominations than national party leaders. It opens the door to candidates who can attract grass-roots followings even as they repel party leaders.The author Alan Ehrenhalt called it The United States of Ambition, in which candidates nominate themselves with their drive and talent for campaigning. For all the controversy he has ignited, Mr. Trump has displayed plenty of both.Mr. Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, began preparing to run long before others recognized his seriousness. He has used his personal wealth to bypass fund-raising concerns that constrain his rivals.He has commanded an outsize share of media attention in a crowded Republican field. And he has used the attention to mine the economic and cultural anxieties of his partys conservative base, especially among working-class white voters.In theory, a gifted Democratic insurgent could do the same thing. In reality, the era of polarization makes it easier for Republican renegades to flourish, because the party base is more ideologically intense and culturally homogeneous.Once dispersed throughout both parties, liberals now almost exclusively flock to the Democrats, and conservatives to the Republicans. But there are significantly more conservatives.For the same reason right-leaning talk-radio shows draw larger audiences than left-leaning programs, Republican primaries are pulled further toward ideological extremes. On the touchstone issue of immigration, Mr. Trump has capitalized by proposing to build a wall on the southern border and send Mexico the bill.As the nation grows more ethnically diverse, Republicans remain overwhelmingly white. Nine of every 10 votes Mitt Romney received in 2012, exit polls showed, came from whites. Nearly half came from whites without college degrees, the Americans feeling most aggrieved by recent economic and cultural trends.Mr. Trump has topped the Republican field by making himself their champion. Within the more diverse Democratic base, theres no single constituency of a comparable size to lift an iconoclast to the nomination.In 2012, for example, Mr. Obama received slightly fewer than one-fourth of his votes from African-Americans; an additional 14 percent came from Hispanics. White liberals accounted for slightly more than one-fourth of his support, whites under 30 just 10 percent.Thats why Senator Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont, faces an uphill fight for the Democratic nomination. He enjoys a strong following among white liberals and young voters, but there arent enough of them to topple a candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who dominates among nonwhites.Mrs. Clinton holds one additional advantage: support from hundreds of so-called superdelegates, party leaders who are free to back the candidate they consider strongest, whatever primary voters say.A generation ago, Democratic officials created superdelegates as a hedge in close contests if they found the rank-and-files choice unsuitable. Fortunately for Mr. Trump, Republicans havent done the same."}

{"text": "LONDON  The Bank of England said on Tuesday that it would increase the size of a capital buffer it requires banks to hold to ensure they can provide lending and other essential banking services in times of financial stress.Lenders in Britain would be required to set aside the equivalent of 0.5 percent of their assets as weighted by risk by March 29, 2017, the central banks Financial Policy Committee said on Tuesday.The Bank of England said it would like to gradually increase the so-called countercyclical capital buffer rate to 1 percent of risk-weighted assets. The rate, which is now set at zero, is intended to vary over time to reflect the risk that the banking system would incur losses on exposures in Britain in the future.Risks associated with domestic credit are no longer subdued, as they were in the period following the financial crisis; and global risks, which can also affect U.K. exposures indirectly, are heightened, the banks Financial Policy Committee said as part of its quarterly policy statement on Tuesday.The Financial Policy Committee also said that uncertainty surrounding a June 23 referendum on whether Britain should leave the European Union could lead to further depreciation of the pound and affect the cost and availability of loans in Britain.The committee assesses the risks around the referendum to be the most significant near-term domestic risks to financial stability, the central bank said. It will continue to monitor the channels of risk closely and support mitigating actions where possible.The increase in the capital buffer, however, is not expected to result in another round of fund-raising by lenders, the central bank said.The Prudential Regulation Authority, a regulator within the Bank of England, is reducing a separate capital buffer requirement that overlapped with the countercyclical capital buffer.Removing the overlap will mean banks that account for about 75 percent of lending in Britain will not see their overall capital requirements increase, the Bank of England said.Many smaller banks will be among those whose future capital requirements will increase, the Financial Policy Committee said. Most of those banks, however, already hold enough capital to meet the requirements, the committee said.The F.P.C. recognizes that these banks may wish to build capital over time in order to retain some excess over regulatory capital buffers, but their current position means that any such action will be able to take place gradually, the committee said.The central bank also revealed the elements of the stress tests that are to be given later this year to measure the ability of Britains largest lenders to survive a financial crisis or severe economic downturn.The tests will apply to seven of Britains biggest banks and building societies, which account for about 80 percent of the lending to the British economy. This years tests will examine macroeconomic and trading risks to bank portfolios, as well as projections for potential fines and other costs for improper conduct.The results will be released in the fourth quarter.Four of Britains biggest banks will be part of a Europewide separate stress test that will be conducted by the European Banking Authority this year."}

Americans are feeling more confident this month, another report released on Tuesday showed, as a rebounding stock market brightened their outlook.In January, the Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.7 percent from a year earlier, a slight increase from the 5.6 percent annual increase in December.The pace of U.S. home value growth has been picking up bit by bit over the past few months, driven in large part by stubbornly low inventory in most markets that creates competition and drives up prices for those homes that are available, said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at the real estate firm Zillow.Home values have risen at a faster pace than average hourly wages, which have improved just 2.2 percent, according to a government report this month. Tight supplies of homes for sale have propelled much of the price growth, as low mortgage rates and steady hiring have increased demand.Denver, Portland, San Francisco and Seattle each registered double-digit annual price increases. Home values rose in all 20 metro area markets, which account for roughly half of the housing stock in the country.The index remains more than 11 percent below its mid-2006 peak, when subprime mortgages pushed the market to heights that set off the recession in late 2007.Existing homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.08 million in February, the National Association of Realtors said this month. Sales dipped 7.1 percent from a relatively healthy pace in January, but an increase in the number of signed contracts to buy houses indicates that purchases should rebound in March.Despite the demand, listings in February declined 1.1 percent from a year ago. Many homeowners are reluctant to sell, because they lack the equity to cover the down payment for a new house.The low inventory of homes for sale  currently about a five-month supply  means that would-be sellers seeking to trade up are having a hard time finding a new, larger home, said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices.In a separate report, the Conference Board said that its consumer confidence index rose to 96.2 this month, after tumbling to a revised 94 in February.Consumers assessment of current economic conditions has dipped. But their outlook for the future has improved modestly.United States markets got off to a dismal start in 2016, driven by fears of economic weakness overseas and plunging oil prices, but they have since recovered most of those losses. This month, 28.7 percent of consumers said they expected stocks to rise over the next year. That was up from 26.9 percent in February, the lowest share since July 2012.A year ago, the overall consumer confidence index stood at 101.4. But Americans have grown cautious, and consumer spending grew at a meager 0.1 percent annual rate in February, the government said on Monday, matching Januarys unimpressive gain.Given the very disappointing real consumer spending results for January and February, this pickup in confidence is good news, said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  Now that the United States government has cracked open an iPhone that belonged to a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting without Apples help, the tech company is under pressure to find and fix the flaw.But unlike other cases where security vulnerabilities have cropped up, Apple may face a higher set of hurdles in ferreting out and repairing the particular iPhone hole that the government hacked.The challenges start with the lack of information about the method that the law enforcement authorities, with the aid of a third party, used to break into the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, an attacker in the San Bernardino rampage last year. Federal officials have refused to identify the person, or organization, who helped crack the device, and have declined to specify the procedure used to open the iPhone. Apple also cannot obtain the device to reverse-engineer the problem, the way it would in other hacking situations.Making matters trickier, Apples security operation has been in flux. The operation was reorganized late last year. A manager who had been responsible for handling most of the governments data extraction requests left the team to work in a different part of the company, according to four current and former Apple employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the changes. Other employees, among them one whose tasks included trying to hack Apples own products, left the company over the last few months, they said, while new people have joined.The situation is in many ways a continuation of the cat-and-mouse game Apple is constantly engaged in with hackers, but the unusually prominent nature of this hacking  and the fact that the hacker was the United States government  creates a predicament for the company.Apple is a business, and it has to earn the trust of its customers, said Jay Kaplan, chief executive of the tech security company Synack and a former National Security Agency analyst. It needs to be perceived as having something that can fix this vulnerability as soon as possible.Apple referred to a statement it made on Monday when the government filed to drop its case demanding that the company help it open Mr. Farooks iPhone. We will continue to increase the security of our products as the threats and attacks on our data become more frequent and more sophisticated, Apple said.Apple has been making many long-term moves to increase the security of its devices. The companys chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has told colleagues that he stands by Apples road map to encrypt everything stored on its devices and services, as well as information stored in Apples cloud service iCloud, which customers use to back up the data on their mobile devices. Apple engineers have also begun developing new security measures that would make it tougher for the government to open a locked iPhone.For now, with the dearth of information about the flaw in Mr. Farooks iPhone 5C, which runs Apples iOS 9 operating system, security experts could only guess at how the government broke into the smartphone.Forensics experts said the government might have attacked Apples system using a widely discussed method to extract information from a protected area in the phone by removing a chip and fooling a mechanism that blocks password guessing, in order to find the users password and unlock the data.The authorities may have used a procedure that mirrors the phones storage chip, called a NAND chip, and then copied it onto another chip. Often referred to as NAND-mirroring, this would allow the F.B.I. to replace the original NAND chip with one that has a copy of that content. If the F.B.I. tried 10 passcodes to unlock the phone and failed, it could then generate a new copy of the phones content and try another password guess.Its like trying to play the same level on Super Mario Brothers over and over again and just restoring from your saved game every time you kill Mario, said Jonathan Zdziarski, an iOS forensics expert.Newer iPhone models may be less susceptible to NAND-mirroring because they have an upgraded chip known as the A7, with a security processor called the Secure Enclave that has a unique numerical key not known to the company and which is essential to the securing of information stored in the phone.Security vulnerabilities in Apple products have become increasingly prized by hackers in recent years, given the ubiquity of the companys mobile devices. Yet as interest has grown in attacking Apples hardware and software, the companys own security teams have been in flux.Apple previously had two main security teams  a group called Core OS Security Engineering and a product security team. The product security team included a privacy group that examined whether data was properly encrypted and anonymized, among other functions, according to three former Apple employees. The product security team also had people who reacted to vulnerabilities found by people outside Apple, as well as a proactive team, called RedTeam, which worked to actively hack Apple products.Last year, the product security team was broken up and the privacy group began reporting to a new manager, the former employees said. The rest of product security  the proactive and reactive pieces  was absorbed by the Core OS Security Engineering team, which itself experienced shifts.The leader of the Core OS Security Engineering team, Dallas DeAtley, left the security division last year to work in a different part of Apple. Mr. DeAtley was one of the few employees who over the years had taken care of government requests to extract data from iPhones. Mr. DeAtley did not respond to requests for comment.A few other members of the team also departed. Others joined Apple as the company acquired a handful of security outfits last year, including LegbaCore, which previously found and fixed flaws for Apple.Some of the departures had more to do with market forces, the former Apple employees said. Security professionals are some of the most sought-after engineers in the technology sector.Whether Apples security operation will ever obtain information about how the government hacked into Mr. Farooks iPhone remains unclear.Its possible that the government wont say how it opened the iPhone because the method is proprietary to the company that helped the F.B.I., said Stewart A. Baker, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson and the Department of Homeland Securitys first assistant secretary for policy.Within the security community, researchers and professionals said they were incensed that they  and Apple  may not find out how the F.B.I. was able to crack Mr. Farooks iPhone.There is very little debate that it is in everyones best interest that Apple find out about this vulnerability and everyone should be asking why that is not the case, said Alex Rice, the chief technology officer at HackerOne, a security company in San Francisco that helps coordinate vulnerability disclosure for corporations."}
{"text": "Hillary Clinton heads to Harlem on Wednesday.The presidential campaign has taken Mrs. Clinton from South Carolina to Seattle, from Phoenix to Florida. But this week, after two days of campaigning in Wisconsin, she will come home, or at least to her adopted home, New York, which will hold its primary on April 19.Its natural that Mrs. Clinton chose Harlem, the neighborhood where Bill Clinton set up his private office after leaving the White House and where both the Clintons enjoy deep support among black elected officials and community leaders.Last month, Mrs. Clinton delivered a speech at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture on Malcolm X Boulevard on ending systemic racism. On Wednesday, she will rally voters at the Apollo Theater, the storied venue that has hosted Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Marvin Gaye and other iconic black musicians.At the event last month, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio, Representative Charles B. Rangel and former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., stood onstage in support of Mrs. Clinton, who served as a senator from New York and who lives in Chappaqua, N.Y.Mrs. Clinton needs to win  and win significantly  in New York to put to rest any suspicion of weakness in her candidacy after several losses to Senator Bernie Sanders in recent caucuses. She maintains a significant lead in the delegates needed to capture the nomination, but should she lose the Wisconsin primary on April 5, Mr. Sanders would have fresh momentum as they both turn their focus to New York.The Sanders campaign is confident about its chances in New York, particularly upstate, where white working class voters have lost jobs, and in liberal pockets like Brooklyn. The Sanders camp is pushing Mrs. Clinton to participate in a New York-based debate ahead of voting in the state.As Mr. Sanderss campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, wrote to Mrs. Clintons campaign manager, Robby Mook, New York will play a critical role in determining the Democratic nominee."}
{"text": "To keep our muscles healthy deep into retirement, we may need to start working out more now, according to a new study of world-class octogenarian athletes. The study found substantial differences at a cellular level between the athletes muscles and those of less active people.Muscular health is, of course, essential for successful aging. As young adults, we generally have scads of robust muscle mass. But that situation doesnt last.Muscles consist of fibers, each attached to a motor neuron in our spinal column by long, skinny nerve threads called axons. The fiber and its neuron are known as a muscle unit.When this muscle unit is intact, the neuron sends commands to the muscle fiber to contract. The muscle fiber responds, and your leg, eyelid, pinky finger or other body part moves.However, motor neurons die as we age, beginning as early as in our 30s, abruptly marooning the attached muscle fiber, leaving it disconnected from the nervous system. In younger people, another neuron can come to the rescue, snaking out a new axon and re-attaching the fiber to the spinal cordBut with each passing decade, we have fewer motor neurons. So some muscle fibers, bereft of their original neuron, do not get another. These fibers wither and die and we lose muscle mass, becoming more frail. This process speeds up substantially once we reach age 60 or so.Scientists have not known whether the decline in muscular health with age is inevitable or whether it might be slowed or altered.There have been encouraging hints that exercise changes the trajectory of muscle aging. A 2010 study of recreational runners in their 60s, for instance, found that their leg muscles contained far more intact muscle units than the muscles of sedentary people of the same age.But whether exercise would continue to protect muscles in people decades older than 60, for whom healthy muscles might be the difference between independence and institutionalization, had never been examined.So for the new study, which was published last week in the Journal of Applied Physiology, researchers from McGill University in Canada and other schools contacted 29 world-class track and field athletes in their 80s and invited them to the universitys performance lab. They also recruited a separate group of healthy but relatively inactive people of the same age to act as controls.At the lab, the scientists measured muscle size and then had the athletes and those in the control group complete a simple test of muscular strength and function in which they pressed their right foot against a movable platform as forcefully as possible. While they pressed, the scientists used sensors to track electrical activity within a leg muscle.Using mathematical formulas involving muscle size and electrical activity, the scientists then determined precisely how many muscle units were alive and functioning in each volunteers leg muscle. They also examined the electrical signal plots to see how effectively each motor neuron was communicating with its attached muscle fiber.Unsurprisingly, the elite masters athletes legs were much stronger than the legs of the other volunteers, by an average of about 25 percent. The athletes had about 14 percent more total muscle mass than the control group.More interesting to the researchers, the athletes also had almost 30 percent more motor units in their leg muscle tissue, and these units were functioning better than those of people in the sedentary group. In the control group, many of the electrical messages from the motor neuron to the muscle showed signs of jitter and jiggle, which are actual scientific terms for signals that stutter and degrade before reaching the muscle fiber. Such weak signaling often indicates a motor neuron that is approaching death.In essence, the sedentary elderly people had fewer motor units in their muscles, and more of the units that remained seemed to be feeling their age than in the athletes legs.The athletes leg muscles were much healthier at the cellular level.They resembled the muscles of people decades younger, said Geoffrey Power, who led the study while a graduate student at McGill and is now an assistant professor at the University of Guelph in Ontario.Of course, this type of single-snapshot-in-time study cant tell us whether the athletes training actually changed their muscle health over the years or if the athletes were somehow blessed from birth with better muscles, allowing them to become superb masters athletes.But Dr. Power, who also led the 2010 study, said that he believes exercise does add to the numbers and improve the function of our muscle units as we grow older.Whether we have to work out like a world-class 80-year-old athlete to benefit, however, remains in question. Most of these competitors train intensely for several hours every week, Dr. Power said. But on the plus side, some of them did not start their competitive regimens until they had reached their 50s, providing hope for the dilatory among us.Related:For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}
{"text": "Their first collaboration, the New York premiere of the opera Charlie Parkers Yardbird, will not open until Friday, but the Apollo Theater and Opera Philadelphia are already making plans to get the band back together. They announced Wednesday that they would continue to team up to stage contemporary operas over the next few years.The next production at the Apollo will be in the fall of 2017: the New York premiere of We Shall Not Be Moved, currently being developed by the composer Daniel Bernard Roumain, the librettist Marc Bamuthi Joseph, and the director Bill T. Jones. The work, which was inspired by the writings of Philadelphia high school students who participated in Opera Philadelphias Hip Hopera program, will be given its world premiere in September 2017 at the Wilma Theater in Philadelphia as part of a new opera festival by the company.The budding intercity collaboration began after Gotham Chamber Opera closed last fall, throwing into doubt its plans to stage Yardbird, which it had commissioned with Opera Philadelphia, at the Apollo. So Opera Philadelphia and the theater rushed into the breach to save the production, and developed a good working relationship in the process.Opera Philadelphia has been an incredible partner, and We Shall Not Be Moved, with its fusion of spoken word and hip-hop beats, will be an exciting next collaboration, Mikki Shepard, the Apollo Theaters executive producer, said in a statement. David B. Devan, the general director and president of Opera Philadelphia, said that the two organizations have several additional ideas in the works for future seasons.Yardbird, starring the bel canto tenor Lawrence Brownlee, will be performed Friday night and Sunday afternoon at the Apollo  where the real Charlie Parker played."}
{"text": "Before Aaron Paul was Jesse Pinkman, Walter Whites meth-making pupil in Breaking Bad, he was a regular on HBOs Big Love  a drama about a polygamist sect, which explored abuse in the name of religion and the solace of an unorthodox faith.Hulus The Path, whose first two episodes appear on that streaming service on Wednesday, shares themes with the latter show; it takes place on the upstate New York compound of a fictional cult, the Meyerist Movement. Like the former show, it uses Mr. Pauls gift for playing morally conflicted souls under pressure.The combination has potential, but the execution, while offering glimpses into a fascinating subculture, is sluggish and unfocused. The Path is literally cult TV, but no cult classic.Eddie Lane (Mr. Paul) has found a life and a family within Meyerism, a hierarchical organization  members climb a Ladder of 10 rungs  built on a pastiche of pseudoscience and South American shamanism. (Note to viewers and lawyers: It is not Scientology! The series even references Scientology as a separate organization, to make things clear.)Eddie came to Meyerism after a troubled childhood, but his wife, Sarah (Michelle Monaghan), was born into it  shes a kind of Meyerist royalty. (In their lingo, she ranks 8R to his 6R.) Their son, Hawk (Kyle Allen), is 15, almost old enough to take the Meyerist vows. Its a comfortable life of vegetarian dinners, home birthing in pools and earnest talk about unburdening.It will soon fall apart. On a spiritual retreat, Eddie has an epiphany that convinces him Meyerism is a fraud, even as the compound leader, Cal (Hugh Dancy of Hannibal), who claims to have the ear of the mysterious founder, Steven Meyer (Keir Dullea of 2001 A Space Odyssey), hatches a plan to raise Meyerisms public profile by questionable means. As Eddie hides his doubts (the Meyerists are not kind to apostates) and Sarah is drawn into Cals power struggle with the sects higher-ups, the three form a triangle thats both emotional and spiritual.The strong world-building by the shows creator, Jessica Goldberg, gives the cult a thought-through history and jargon  even its own crunchy culture, including folk songs (Up, up, up the Ladder/To the Garden in the sky!) and childrens books.But The Path is so careful not to make Meyerism reflect any particular belief system that the faith feels like a grab bag. So, ultimately, does the series. Sometimes it has the eerie tone of a supernatural thriller; sometimes its a low-key family ensemble piece; sometimes its a melodrama, particularly the underdeveloped story of Mary (Emma Greenwell), a brittle sexual-abuse survivor drawn to the cult and Cal. Theres also a legal subplot that never quite takes off, in which an F.B.I. agent, Abe Gaines (Rockmond Dunbar), tries to infiltrate the group.Often its pure camp, especially the hallucination and dream sequences the show overuses to explore character psychology. They may be explained by the cults ritual use of ayahuasca and sacred herb, but they seem like a goof if youre not smoking whatever The Path is.Theres a maddening vagueness to The Path. Its fuzzy on whether Meyerism is an obscure sect or a global menace. Only sometimes do you get a sense of what the faith means to its adherents. From the opening scene, in which Meyerists aid survivors in the wreckage of a tornado that looks precisely like a TV set of a tornados wreckage, the show has a cool, stage-managed unreality.In the series best parts, Ms. Goldberg engages a paradox: Meyerism may be an exploitative scam, but its members believe and want to do good with it, even the corrupt Cal. The dynamics of the Lane household  especially Hawks fumbling adolescent questioning  recall the family dramedies of the executive producer Jason Katims (Parenthood, Friday Night Lights).In these moments, The Path echoes themes of The Americans (idealists in the service of a dubious cause) and The Leftovers (the vacuum created when faith is shaken). Its anchored by strong lead performances; Mr. Dancy gives depth to what might have been a cardboard conniving villain. And toward the end of the season, as The Path dives into Eddies back story, it gets the kind of grounding it could have used from the beginning.But by that point, you may have already jumped off the Ladder."}
{"text": "New color correcting makeup, in highly pigmented shades like canary yellow and pistachio green, seems better suited to an afternoon of decorating Easter eggs than a morning in front of the bathroom mirror.But the trend  a favorite of bloggers and Instagrammers, it would seem  is fast developing a following, with a slew of new products that promise to mask complexion problems like ruddiness, sallowness and lackluster skin.The principle of color correcting makeup is essentially that of color theory: That is, opposite hues cancel each other out. So a primer in pale green can mute redness, lavender minimizes ashy tones and yellow brightens dull skin. Depending on your skin tone, pink, peach or orange can help conceal under-eye circles and hyperpigmentation.The makeup can be a bit daunting if youve never tried it before. The trick is use a teeny, tiny amount of color corrector, no matter what shade youre using, said Eliza Davila, one of 15 Sephora makeup artists who contributed to a color correcting tutorial that was added to the stores smartphone app this month. It should blend into the skin and conceal properly.Brushes or sponges are effective, but, Ms. Davila said, your fingertip is the easiest tool with which to apply these correctors, using a delicate tapping motion.For help with color choices and application techniques, there are plenty of instructional videos online, on YouTube as well as on sites like Sephoras.Algenist REVEAL Concentrated Color Correcting Drops, introduced this month, are especially easy to apply: The tinted fluid can be mixed into moisturizer or foundation or used on its own. Each of the four colors includes a specific type of algae in its formula to help treat as well as cover the skin.Urban Decay Naked Skin Color Correcting Fluid, also newly available, comes in slender tubes that look as if they may contain lip gloss. The products texture is on the thick side, but it quickly blends into the skin when applied. The five colors include a pale yellow and a green tint that brings a matcha latte to mind.Cover(t) Stick Color Corrector, a recent addition to the Marc Jacobs Beauty line, is a swirl of two corresponding shades inside a squat standup tube. One option, Bright Now, mixes sky blue and pinkish beige to brighten; the two others tackle redness and dark spots.The compact silver-toned cases of the new Cover FX Correct Clicks look like truncated tubes of lipstick. Theyre available in six shades, including three that target dark spots on different skin tones. They appear quite matte but offer sheer coverage.Lancme added Miracle CC Cushion Color Correcting Primer to its collection a few weeks ago. Its a small compact with a spongy pad thats saturated with a thin cream in one of four colors. The consistency is pleasingly light and blends easily.To combat multiple issues, theres the new Tarte Rainforest of the Sea Wipeout Color-Correcting Palette, a large compact packed with six creamy discs ranging from muted yellow to milk chocolate. The combination provides soft, understated coverage thats easy to customize depending on how your skin looks each day.While many of these products aim for spot correction, YSL Beaut Forever Light Creator CC Primer delivers a thin wash of color over your entire face. Introduced this month in three colors, the liquidy tint includes a broad spectrum sunscreen. YSL offers more targeted coverage, too: In January, it added three tinted versions of its popular Touche clat highlighter to its line."}
{"text": "Lukas Graham(Warner Bros.)What a nice guy Lukas Graham Forchhammer is  respectful toward his parents, hard-working, grateful to be heard. Hes the singer, lyricist and leader of a Danish band, Lukas Graham, that is releasing its American debut album with whats already an international hit, 7 Years. In that song, he cherishes his parents advice about how to get through the decades of life, mourns his fathers death and looks forward to children of his own.Its the kind of growing-up-and-aging-gracefully song thats a country-music staple. But 7 Years is placed instead where pop meets R&B. Its tune circles through a few notes, the lead vocal hints at Michael Jacksons tenor quaver, and theres a hip-hop undertow of sustained strings and a sparse backbeat. Its sweet earnestness in a shrewd, ambitious package.The music, like much Scandinavian pop, ignores genre to draw on whatever works, current and vintage. It merges electronic dance music keyboards with Bee Gees falsettos in Take the World by Storm, puts an R&B croon atop hints of Beethovens Moonlight Sonata in Better Than Yourself (Criminal Mind Pt. 2), and looks back to 1970s and 1980s R&B (more Hall & Oates than Stevie Wonder) in Strip No More and Drunk in the Morning, two songs that admit to boys-will-be-boys misbehavior. What Happened to Perfect, a fraying-romance song, places somber organ chords behind an increasingly desperate plea.But through most of the album, filial loyalty merges with humble-bragging  not only in 7 Years but also in Youre Not There, another elegy for his father, and in Mama Said, a song about a non-affluent childhood that echoes (and credits) the chorus from Annie that Jay Z also used in Hard Knock Life. In Happy Home, the singer crows about the bands media coverage and cash flow, but takes care to credit everything to the lessons of parents and grandparents.Behind the modesty, though, is an equally determined sense of enterprise. Dont You Worry Bout Me starts with the piano and organ of an old-fashioned gospel song and turns into lilting, upbeat soul as Mr. Forchhammer sings about transcending sorrow via careerism. A lot of people told me, when daddy passed away/Go take some time off, but I got no time to waste, he sings. Thats a statement of priorities, a determined flash of candor."}

The 30-second online spot, directed at female women voters in Florida, Ohio and Washington, D.C., uses Mr. Trumps remark to MSNBC, which he later backed away from, as an impetus to attack his longer history of comments about women.When it comes to women, the Republican front-runner is  the ad begins, and then flashes a scene from Mr. Trumps long-running reality TV series The Apprentice when he tells a female contestant she must be a pretty picture, dropping on your knees.In another scene, after the word demeaning flashes across the screen, Mr. Trump tells a female journalist, You wouldnt have your job if you werent beautiful.The word insulting then appears, followed by Mr. Trumps exchange this week with MSNBCs Chris Matthews. After prodding by Mr. Matthews at a televised town-hall-style event on Wednesday on the topic of abortion, Mr. Trump said There has to be some form of punishment.The word Dangerous flashes ominously on screen.

That ad showed women repeating some of Mr. Trumps descriptions about women, including bimbo, dog, and fat pig.This is how Donald Trump talks about our mothers, our sisters, our daughters, the women in the ad say."}
{"text": "The National Jazz Museum in Harlem has always been, like the music it honors, a study in adaptability. For the last 15 years, it has operated out of a modest fourth-floor space in East Harlem, while developing big plans for a permanent home. Now, after weathering a few disappointments, the museum has relocated to a new storefront on West 129th Street, in a move that signals not only an improvement to its public facilities but also a renewal of its mission.Being in a new space has shifted our approach to what is possible, Ryan Maloney, the museums director of education and programming, said during an opening reception on Tuesday night, as a quartet led by the pianist Marc Cary played a hard-swinging Hank Mobley tune.The museum now sits off Malcolm X Boulevard, a couple of blocks north of Sylvias and Red Rooster, the emblematic culinary institutions of old and new Harlem. It occupies the ground floor of a new condominium building, and while its not a large footprint  just under 2,400 square feet, of which 1,900 is devoted to public space  the design and layout were carefully considered.In some ways, the embrace of that small scale reflects well on the institution. Founded in 1997 by Leonard Garment, former counsel to President Richard M. Nixon, the National Jazz Museum in Harlem began with noble intentions but limited resources. We flailed around for several years, and while we did, the money ran out, Mr. Garment wrote in a 2002 article for The New York Times. (He died in 2013.)The museum found its footing, in incremental steps, under the executive leadership of Loren Schoenberg. A veteran saxophonist, pianist, educator and historian, Mr. Schoenberg brought an air of authority to the museum, while strengthening its bonds with the jazz public and institutions like the Smithsonian. He enlisted two artistic directors, both still actively involved: the bassist Christian McBride and the pianist Jon Batiste. (Mr. McBride is the recently announced new artistic director for the Newport Jazz Festival; Mr. Batiste, the bandleader on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, was one of Mr. Schoenbergs students at Juilliard.)There was always a drive to secure a permanent home. One intended location, in the historic Victoria Theater, sputtered when the redevelopment plan stalled. Another prospect, in a mixed-use space across 125th Street from the Apollo Theater, also fell through.While we were looking for a space, we realized that it was necessary to do public programming, said Mr. Schoenberg, who is now a founding director and senior scholar. And during that period of a decade or so, we became known for the public programming. We began to think that the future of the museum was not really bound up in a huge space, but in being an institution that does hundreds of public programs a year, and is uniquely anchored in the community.The museum has held guided listening sessions, along with musical performances and exhibitions. A series called Harlem Stride  equal parts history lesson, demo and cutting session  was led this year by the pianist Ethan Iverson. Among the featured programs this spring are a concert and lecture series called Mies and Miles: Design and Architecture in Music (Tuesday through April 26), led by Tim Porter, chairman of the museums board of trustees, and Albert Murray: 20th-Century American Genius (May 10 and 12), a symposium organized by the writer Greg Thomas.The schedule reflects a continuing commitment to jazz outreach at street level, with few pretensions. Were more like the Duke Ellington Band than the New York Philharmonic, Mr. Schoenberg said. The effect that a single member can have  they vibrate much more vividly in the organization, because its still relatively small.Since unofficially opening its doors in February, Mr. Maloney said, the museum had hosted more than 400 visiting schoolchildren, as well as some international tourists.Working within its limited space, it has put up an exhibition titled Vibrations, which draws a connection, mainly through photographs, from early jazz musicians to contemporary artists like the rapper Kendrick Lamar. But the institutions primary draw will continue to be the range of expertise and enthusiasm that it mobilizes through programming, and all the ways it engages with the public.Were going to be able to do a lot more partnering with other arts organizations in this space, Mr. Porter said. The other thing is, this really allows us to be a full participant in the life of Harlem."}

It is, indeed, quiet.The congregation has moved its services to a storefront space at 500 West 148th Street. There are no longer any pews in the 600-seat auditorium. The chandeliers under which Mr. Davis spoke have been removed for safekeeping.Darnelle Watts, who identified himself as a minister of the church when we met last week, said the future held demolition and then construction of a 10-story apartment building at the north end of the 125-foot-long site. A new two-story church is planned for the south end, with a sanctuary, a dining hall, classrooms and a chapel that would incorporate the architectural artifacts of the current church.Mr. Watts deferred to the pastor of the church, Kevin Griffin, on questions such as who would build the project. Telephone messages left for Mr. Griffin were not returned. (The citys Buildings Information System shows no demolition permit for the site.)Were going to build a stronger and a better church, Mr. Watts said. Within a year and a half, we should be back.But there was no disguising his sorrow that the 95-year-old building, with all of its memories, would be lost in the bargain.We tried for years to keep it up, Mr. Watts said. The roof wasnt as strong as we thought. When you fixed one hole, another one opened up. It just became one hole too many. The sanctuary was abandoned six months ago, he said.What brought me there was an alert from Michael Henry Adams, the perennially beleaguered but indefatigable defender of Harlem landmarks, official and otherwise. (Childs Memorial Temple is not a designated landmark.)By the time I arrived, the west memorial windows of the church had already been removed. But the east windows  dedicated to Mother Elizabeth Burgess, Irene Roland, LuLa Robinson, Alvara Clarke and Deacon Willie Quick  were still in place.So was the Bluebirds elegant proscenium arch, draped in lyrelike ornamental scrolls, painted gold, and framed by balconies faced with golden swags.What can be done? Christopher Moore asked in an email, after I told him what was going on. Mr. Moore, a former member of the Landmarks Preservation Commission, helped curate the 2005 exhibition Malcolm X: A Search for Truth, at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture of the New York Public Library.He answered his own question: Move the proscenium intact to the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, which is scheduled to open this year, or to the New-York Historical Society, the Museum of the City of New York or a new theater.One might reasonably wonder how the funeral of an American Muslim leader, known not only as Malcolm X but also as el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz, came to be held in a Pentecostal church that was once, in its varied existence, a synagogue.As 1965 began, the most prominent Muslim place of worship in New York was Mosque No. 7 of the Nation of Islam, at Lenox Avenue and West 116th Street. Malcolm had been an eminent leader in the Nation of Islam until 1964, when he repudiated that movement, led by Elijah Muhammad in Chicago. After that, Malcolm considered himself a marked man.Members of the Nation of Islam were suspected of killing Malcolm. Mosque No. 7 was firebombed the day after his assassination.As thousands paid their respects to Malcolm at a Harlem funeral home, his followers searched anxiously for a church in which to conduct the funeral, the author Alex Haley wrote in the epilogue to The Autobiography of Malcolm X. The famed Abyssinian Baptist Church, on West 138th Street, was among those that declined, he said.Bishop Alvin A. Childs of the Faith Temple Church of God in Christ (later renamed in his honor) was the clergyman who finally opened his doors. He and his wife then received bomb threats at home and at church, Mr. Haley wrote.But the hourlong funeral  conducted as a Muslim service, with Bishop Childs on the sideline  turned out to be stately, orderly and peaceful.It was Daviss soliloquy on the meaning of Malcolms life to the black people of Harlem that captured the publics imagination, and in subsequent decades would dwarf everything else that occurred that day, Manning Marable wrote in Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention.Here is how Mr. Davis concluded his valedictory, framed by the little proscenium arch whose future is now uncertain:Consigning these mortal remains to earth, the common mother of all, secure in the knowledge that what we place in the ground is no more now a man  but a seed  which, after the winter of our discontent, will come forth again to meet us. And we will know him then for what he was and is  a Prince  our own black shining Prince!  who didnt hesitate to die, because he loved us so."}
{"text": "Millions of Americans who have health coverage through a big employer are receiving a new, unfamiliar tax form in the mail this year, thanks to the Affordable Care Act: the 1095-C.Most tax filers do not need to do much with it, except file it away with their tax records. But because it is new, the form is causing a bit of confusion, said Victor Saliterman, vice president and general manager for health care reform at the benefits and payroll administrator ADP.This is the first time in decades that a major new employee tax form has been widely distributed, Mr. Saliterman said, and many workers do not know what to do with it when it arrives. (The familiar W-2, the form that details employee wages, dates to the early 1940s.) This is definitely new ground, he said.So what is a 1095-C? It is a form for health care, sent to people who have health insurance through a large employer. The maker of TurboTax, the do-it-yourself tax software, estimates that about 65 million people are getting the 1095-C form this year.The 1095-C is created and sent by your employer, which also sends a copy to the Internal Revenue Service. It contains information about the type of health coverage that your employer offered for the prior year  essentially showing that the employer made affordable health coverage available. It also shows the premium for the lowest-cost plan offered, which may differ from what you paid if you chose a more expensive option.The form also may show what months you and your family were covered, so it serves as official proof of insurance  helpful to have in case you are audited, Mr. Saliterman said, because the Affordable Care Act requires most people to have health insurance, or pay a penalty.The C is actually one of three versions of Form 1095. People who bought coverage through the federal or state health insurance exchanges get the 1095-A. A grab bag of others, including workers at small employers and those with government health insurance, like Medicaid, get a 1095-B, which is also new this year. Pretty much everyone with health insurance should get one of the forms. TurboTax has an online tool to help you understand which one to expect.It is not necessary to file the 1095-C (or versions A or B, for that matter) with your tax return. Rather, filers should check the form for accuracy, use any information needed, and then store it along with other important tax documents, said Debra Hammer, a spokeswoman for Affordable Care Act topics at Intuit, the maker of TurboTax. Generally, she said, you should keep tax returns and supporting documentation for at least three years.Because the 1095-C form is new and companies are getting used to preparing it, recipients should check carefully to make sure that the form accurately reflects their health coverage for the prior year, said Jeffrey Martin, a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants health care task force. If there is any discrepancy, he said, filers should report it by calling the contact number listed on the form.More information about the forms is available online from the I.R.S. and from the Tax Institute at H&R Block.Here are some questions about health insurance tax forms: What if I have not yet received a Form 1095-B or C?Employers are required to send out the forms by March 31. So if you have not received one by next week, contact your benefits department.But do not delay filing your tax return if you do not have the form, the I.R.S. advises.Most people do not need the information on the form to complete their tax return, and can use other records  like payroll statements, insurance cards or benefits documents  to confirm coverage, if necessary. What if I had marketplace coverage and have not received a Form 1095-A?Unlike other versions of the form, the 1095-A is crucial to filing a return, because it has information necessary to reconcile any premium tax credit you received. So you should not file a return unless you have it in hand, the I.R.S. says. Most people should have received the form already. If yours has not arrived, visit HealthCare.gov or your state exchange to download an electronic copy. Can I receive more than one version of Form 1095?Yes. You may get multiple forms, depending on the details of your job and health coverage during 2015, said Lindsey Buchholz, a program manager at the Tax Institute at H&R Block. If, for example, you were self-employed and had marketplace coverage for several months, then got a new job and switched to workplace health insurance, you should receive a 1095-A from your marketplace insurer and a separate form from your new employer.It is possible, she added, that you may get two different forms even if you did not change jobs, depending on the details of how your employer administers its health coverage."}

{"text": "LONDON  The German retailer Metro Group said on Wednesday that it would split into two publicly listed companies, with one focused on consumer electronics and the other on its wholesale and food operations.Metro, whose brands include the electronics retailer Media-Saturn and Metro Cash & Carry, said the split would accelerate growth at the companies, would simplify their structures and would allow each business to independently pursue acquisitions and partnerships.Both companies would be publicly listed and would have their own management and supervisory boards.I feel very strongly that a split into two independent and focused businesses would be in the best interest of all stakeholders, as it would facilitate a significant opportunity for faster and more profitable growth, Jrgen Steinemann, the chairman of Metros supervisory board, said in a news release.The move came after Metro agreed in June to sell Galeria Kaufhof, the leading department store chain in Germany and Belgium, to the Hudsons Bay Company, which is based in Canada, for 2.85 billion euros, or about $3.2 billion, including debt.News of the plan sent shares of Metro up more than 9 percent in morning trading in Frankfurt on Wednesday.The company said that it would make a final decision on the split after a period of intensive consultation and review, and that it would aim to complete the division by the middle of next year.Olaf Koch, Metros chief executive, would lead the wholesale and food business, the company said, while Pieter August Haas, a member of Metros management board and the chief executive of Media-Saturn, would run the consumer electronics company."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON   A special House committee empaneled to investigate fetal tissue research issued subpoenas on Wednesday to eight medical organizations as part of an investigation that has led to charges of intimidation.The Select Investigative Panel is working in a thoughtful and thorough manner to find the facts about what exactly is going on at these abortion businesses and procurement organizations, said Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Republican from Tennessee who leads the House Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives. Unfortunately, some of these organizations have so redacted documents  even after being subpoenaed  that it is impossible for us to get the complete picture of what is actually going on.Biomed IRB, an independent ethics review board based in San Diego, was among the entities subpoenaed. The boards operations were severely restricted in 2012 by the Food and Drug Administration after inspections found serious problems, including a lack of expertise to analyze studies it was supposed to review.Fred Fox, Biomed IRBs executive director, said in an interview that the first he had heard about the House investigation was a phone call last week in which he was asked whether he wanted to receive the subpoena from a United States marshal or some other way.My only surprise was that I didnt get it before Easter, said Mr. Fox, who added that he did not receive a letter or any other phone call from House investigators before last week, so any claims that he was receiving a subpoena because he refused to cooperate were false.He said he would be considering how to respond in the coming days.The House panel was created to investigate fetal tissue research after the release of surreptitiously recorded videos that claimed to show Planned Parenthood officials trying to profit illegally from the sale of such tissue.The videographers were indicted in Texas, but the House investigation spurred by the videos continues. Twenty states have cleared Planned Parenthood or decided not to investigate. Few affiliates nationwide were engaged in fetal tissue transfers.Ganogen Inc., based in San Leandro, Calif., also received subpoenas. The company is implanting fetal kidneys into rats in hopes of growing them large enough for transplants. The research has drawn the ire of anti-abortion activists, who have described the work as horrific.The committees investigators hope the subpoenas will reveal what Republicans say is the seedy, unethical and gruesome world of fetal tissue research. But abortion rights and research advocates say that women never decide to have an abortion to provide tissue for researchers, so the tissue would be discarded, or it could be used for research that could potentially save millions of lives.Some research using fetal tissue  including studies seeking to give mobility to people paralyzed after motor vehicle crashes  is showing extraordinary promise, researchers say.The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists on Wednesday criticized the House fetal tissue investigation.Unfortunately, some state and federal politicians are working hard to obstruct  or even criminalize  fetal tissue research, limiting the ability of scientists and researchers to develop new vaccines and medicines to prevent and treat disease, a statement said.Mike Reynard, a committee spokesman, said more subpoenas may be issued. Weve been given very little time to complete this investigation, so we cannot spend precious weeks negotiating with uncooperative organizations over documents we must have to understand what exactly is going on, he said. So far, we have issued 15 subpoenas, and more may be necessary depending on where the facts lead us.But for many involved in the research, the House investigation is deeply worrisome. Some fear that by collecting the names of researchers, lab technicians, graduate assistants and even administrative personnel involved in fetal research, members of Congress could be putting lives in danger.Once again, Chair Blackburn is using congressional authority to pursue baseless, inflammatory claims generated by anti-abortion extremists, said Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, the senior Democrat on the committee. Not one of the entities contacted by the panel has expressed concern about letting all the facts come out. Their  and the Democrats  concern is the safety of their researchers, students, doctors, and clinic personnel. Chair Blackburn has refused to explain why she needs a database of names. It is time for this witch hunt to come to an end.On Nov. 27, Robert L. Dear Jr. killed three people and wounded nine at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs. He later said in court that he was guilty and has called himself a warrior for the babies. After his arrest, he reportedly said, No more baby parts.Encouraged by committee Democrats, many universities and organizations blacked out names and other identifying information before submitting hundreds of pages of research documents in response to the committees earlier requests for information. The redactions frustrated committee Republicans."}
{"text": "After Eric Staal told his family he had been traded to the Rangers, Levi Staal, who is 4 years old and is the second of Eric and Tanya Staals three sons, told Eric time after time that he did not want his father to move away. Eric assured Levi that he would not be leaving North Carolina without him.The family, including 6-year-old Parker and 1-year-old Finley, arrived late Sunday in New York, and the Rangers provided the children with team sweaters with E. Staal and his jersey number, 12. Staal then took to Madison Square Gardens ice Monday night for his Rangers debut, a 2-1 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets.Staal, the center of a line that included Oscar Lindberg and Kevin Hayes, played 15 minutes 48 seconds, failing to score on one shot but winning nine of 17 face-offs. The Rangers won on Derek Stepans short-handed goal with 2 minutes 48 seconds remaining.Rangers goaltender Antti Raanta, playing instead of Henrik Lundqvist, preserved the victory by making a pad save on Columbus forward Cam Atkinson with less than a second left in regulation. The Blue Jackets knocked in the rebound, but time had expired.The ref was waving it off, and everybody was skating toward me, Raanta, who made 26 saves, said of his teammates.As far as Staal could recall, it was the first game in which his brother Marc, a 29-year-old Rangers defenseman, was his teammate. But Eric Staal had left behind another brother, 27-year-old Jordan, with the Carolina Hurricanes.Eric Staal made it clear that he did not waive the no-trade clause in his contract just because he thought it would be nice to play on the same team as Marc. Ten years have passed since he helped the Hurricanes win the Stanley Cup, and seven since his last playoff game. It has been a long wait.Having Marc here, obviously, is an extra benefit, Eric Staal said at a news conference at the Garden after the morning skate and a power-play meeting, but if he wasnt, this is still a great spot for me at this moment of my career.Eric Staal, 31, had played his entire 12-year N.H.L. career with the Hurricanes, becoming the teams captain and earning a reputation for his durability, but his contract was set to expire at the end of this season, and Staal said he knew deep down that the team would move on.So he provided Carolina General Manager Ron Francis with a shortlist of teams for which he would waive his no-trade clause, and the Rangers were on it. The Rangers sent two draft picks and a prospect, Aleksi Saarela, to Carolina to use Staal for 20 games and the playoffs.He wasnt going to come here if he didnt think we had the kind of team that could make a deep run in the playoffs, Marc Staal said Monday. Hes missed the playoffs the last six years, and hes been hungry to get back in.The Rangers (37-20-6) opened Monday with the second-best record in the Eastern Conference, and, according to the Sports Club Stats website, had a 99.1 percent chance of qualifying for the playoffs. So it appears as if Staal will satisfy that hunger.But the Washington Capitals (45-12-4), with the best record in not only the Metropolitan Division and the East but also the entire N.H.L., appear to be miles ahead of the Rangers. If they outpace the Islanders, the Rangers will most likely meet the Capitals in the postseasons second round.Playing two rounds hardly qualifies as a deep playoff run, especially for the Rangers, who have been to the conference finals in three of the past four years. By acquiring Staal and declining to trade defenseman Keith Yandle, Rangers management appeared to set the teams playoff lineup.Its a great sign that theyre willing to risk a little of the future to hopefully win now, said defenseman Ryan McDonagh, the Rangers captain.Because forward Jesper Fast called in sick Monday and the trade deadline loomed at 3 p.m., Rangers Coach Alain Vigneault did not say before the game precisely how he planned to use Eric Staal. But Vigneault said he would be counting heavily on Staal. He had won 53.7 of his face-offs this season, a better clip than the teams top two centers, Derick Brassard and Stepan. Staal can also be used on the power play and to kill penalties.It was important to send a message to our group that we believe in them and that we have faith in them, Vigneault said.Staal, however, had only 10 goals in 63 games with the Hurricanes this season. He played his first N.H.L. game on Oct. 9, 2003, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, and 909 N.H.L. regular-season games would grind anyone down.But, said Marc Staal, Hes got 10 years left in him.Eric Staal added: I feel like Im a young guy. It goes so fast. I feel like Ive got a lot of hockey life left in me.He said he planned to focus not on a new contract but on fitting in with the Rangers. Even if it was 10 years ago, his Cup-winning experience will be appreciated by a Rangers roster with only two players who have their names on the Stanley Cup: Dan Boyle and Viktor Stalberg.The Hurricanes were not going to get back to the playoffs this year. With Marc Staal and the Rangers, Eric Staal has another chance.The group of players they have, theyre battle-tested, theyve played big games, Eric Staal said, adding, They havent gotten it done yet, but theyre very close."}
{"text": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.  When Curtis Granderson arrived at the Mets complex Monday morning, he was wearing glasses because he was worried about redness around his eye. The Mets worried it might be pinkeye, and given how contagious that can be, they sent him away and asked him to skip his normal drills for the day.Hell be fine, Manager Terry Collins said Monday afternoon.Nevertheless, the situation served as a reminder that the Mets outfield depth may be put to good use this season, if an injury were to occur. When the Mets signed Alejandro De Aza to a one-year, $5.75 million deal this off-season, and then surprisingly brought back Yoenis Cespedes, too, they had five outfielders who were expecting to get regular playing time. It was widely assumed that the Mets would trade De Aza before the season.De Aza arrived in camp last week and has been going through the motions as if this is where he will spend the season, despite the persistent questions about his status.Its a game, De Aza said of the Mets decision to bring back Cespedes, and as an owner, you do anything you think is better to win games and get to a championship.Last year, De Aza had what he described as a disappointing season. He was traded twice, and he compiled a .261 batting average with 26 extra-base hits in 90 games. De Aza not been an offensive threat since 2012 and 2013. Those years, when he was playing full time, he scored more than 80 runs, stole at least 20 bases and averaged 46 extra-base hits.As the Mets fill out their bench, they might have to debate whether it would be more valuable to have a player like De Aza, who bats left-handed and plays all three outfield positions, or Eric Campbell, who can play the corner infield and outfield positions.When the Mets signed Cespedes, it drastically changed De Azas role. When De Aza signed, the Mets imagined platooning him with Juan Lagares in center field. Now, both are likely to be relegated to backup players at best. The Mets appear inclined to keep De Aza through the spring at least, as insurance against an injury more serious than pinkeye.Im just out there to play baseball, De Aza said. Theres things we cant control. Were out there to play a game and help the team win a game."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in January, as the recent hot streak appears to have been curbed by a shortage of properties for sale and colder weather.The National Association of Realtors said its seasonally adjusted pending home sales index fell 2.5 percent, to 106, in January. The sales index averaged 108.9 in 2015, its highest level since 2006.The number of signed contracts decreased in the Northeast, Midwest and West. Prospective sales improved slightly in the South. But a shortage of listings has tamped down the potential for sales increases akin to last years increase.Steady job growth and low mortgage rates have bolstered demand for housing from the recent lows caused by the recession. Yet the greater demand largely failed to bring more properties onto the market. The number of listings on the market in January fell 2.2 percent from a year ago, the association said in a report last week.At the current sales rate, the inventory of homes would be exhausted in four months. A balanced market usually contains six months supply.The slowdown in the number of signed contracts indicates that the limited selection may be pushing more would-be buyers onto the sidelines. Pending sales are a barometer of future purchases, and a lag of a month or two usually occurs between a contract and a completed sale.The tight inventories have propelled price growth that has tended to be more than double wage gains. The Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index advanced 5.7 percent in December from a year earlier. Average hourly earnings increased just 2.5 percent from a year ago to $25.39, the government reported in early February.Offsetting some of the price pressures are mortgage rates near historical lows. The mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said the average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 3.62 percent last week, below its 3.80 percent mark a year ago."}

As Mr. Rubios prospects for winning his partys leading role become dimmer with each caucus and primary, his brand of rosy Republican optimism has turned into a pugnacious pessimism.BEN MILESHuntington Beach, Calif.To the Editor:I awoke on Saturday in an alternate universe, where the front page of one of the most respected newspapers in the world reported on candidates for the most powerful position in the world  Donald Trump and Marco Rubio  trading insults about urine and sweat. Mr. Trump crudely mocks anyone who crosses him with ad hominem attacks on that persons intelligence or appearance.It is conceivable that one of these men might one day have a finger on the nuclear button. What kind of future do we face when Americans allow, even celebrate, this appalling breakdown of civil discourse? I feel like a refugee in my own country.FRAN GARDNERPortland, Ore.To the Editor:Ross Douthats claim that President Obama incited Donald Trumps rise (From Obama to Trump, column, Feb. 28) has a major flaw. Mr. Douthat states that the president abandoned white working-class voters, but he conveniently overlooks who really manned the barricades hobbling them.From the day Mr. Obama won office, Republicans not only did nothing for working-class citizens while advancing the corplutocracy, theyve attacked every Obama initiative  starting in February 2009, when he signed a weak job-creating stimulus package that Republicans had fought to keep to a crippling fraction of what was needed, lest he be credited. Theyve never let up since.DALE MEADEl Cerrito, Calif."}
{"text": "In the days after Donald J. Trump vanquished his Republican rivals in South Carolina and Nevada, prominent Democrats supporting Hillary Clinton arranged a series of meetings and conference calls to tackle a question many never thought they would ask: How do we defeat Mr. Trump in a general election?Several Democrats argued that Mrs. Clinton, should she be her partys nominee, would easily beat Mr. Trump. They were confident that his incendiary remarks about immigrants, women and Muslims would make him unacceptable to many Americans. They had faith that the growing electoral power of black, Hispanic and female voters would deliver a Clinton landslide if he were the Republican nominee.But others, including former President Bill Clinton, dismissed those conclusions as denial. They said that Mr. Trump clearly had a keen sense of the electorates mood and that only a concerted campaign portraying him as dangerous and bigoted would win what both Clintons believe will be a close November election.That strategy is beginning to take shape, with groups that support Mrs. Clinton preparing to script and test ads that would portray Mr. Trump as a misogynist and an enemy to the working class whose brash temper would put the nation and the world in grave danger. The plan is for those themes to be amplified later by two prominent surrogates: To fight Mr. Trumps ability to sway the news cycle, Mr. Clinton would not hold back on the stump, and President Obama has told allies he would gleefully portray Mr. Trump as incapable of handling the duties of the Oval Office.Democrats say they risk losing the presidency if they fail to take Mr. Trump seriously, much as Republicans have done in the primary campaign.Hes formidable, he understands voters anxieties, and he will be ruthless against Hillary Clinton, said Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut. Ive gone from denial  I cant believe anyone would listen to this guy  to admiration, in the sense that hes figured out how to capture everyones angst, to real worry.During the first Republican debate last summer, Mrs. Clintons campaign manager, Robby Mook, shushed a room full of people at the campaigns Brooklyn headquarters when Mr. Trump started to speak, almost giddily captivated by the wildness of his remarks. Shh, Ive got to get me some Trump, he said.Now, Mr. Mook and his colleagues regard Mr. Trump as a wily, determined and indefatigable opponent who seems to be speaking to broad economic anxieties among Americans and to the widely held belief that traditional politicians are incapable of addressing those problems. Publicly, the Clinton operation is letting the Republicans slug it out. But privately, it and other Democrats are poring over polling data to understand the roots of Mr. Trumps populist appeal and building up troves of opposition research on his business career.The case against Trump will be prosecuted on two levels, said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster and Mrs. Clintons chief strategist in 2008. The first is temperament, and whether he is suited to be commander in chief, Mr. Garin said, echoing conversations that have dominated Democratic circles recently. The second will be based on whether he can really be relied on as a champion for anyone but himself.But the tactics the Clintons have used for years to take down opponents may fall short in a contest between the blunt and unpredictable Mr. Trump and the cautious and scripted Mrs. Clinton: a matchup that operatives on both sides predicted would be an epic, ugly clash between two vastly disparate politicians.Hillary has built a large tanker ship, and shes about to confront Somali pirates, said Matthew Dowd, the chief strategist for former President George W. Bushs 2004 campaign, who is now an independent.This article is based on interviews with more than two dozen advisers, strategists and close allies of the Clintons, including several who have spoken directly with Mr. Clinton. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss strategy publicly.The greatest weapon against Mr. Trump, the Clintons believe, is his tendency to make outrageous, even hateful comments that can come across as unpresidential. During the most recent Republican debate on Thursday, Mr. Trump traded schoolyard taunts with his rivals and threatened to build an even bigger wall on the Mexican border because he did not like a rebuke of his original wall proposal by a former president of Mexico.In South Carolina and Tennessee, Mrs. Clinton began to lay the groundwork for what advisers call a campaign against bigotry, in which she will present herself as the fair-minded foil to Mr. Trump. She declared that Americans needed more love and kindness.Instead of building walls, she has started to say, we need to be tearing down barriers.During the Republican debate on Thursday, the Clinton campaign posted an image on Instagram that said, These are not American values: Racism, sexism, bigotry, discrimination, inequality.Mr. Trump emphatically denies being bigoted, saying he is simply not politically correct. But he has already signaled that he would be vicious against Mrs. Clinton. He said that she should be indicted for her use of a private email server as secretary of state and that Mr. Clintons extramarital affairs were fair game in the election because they were an abuse of women.While Mrs. Clinton radiates positive energy on the trail, Democratic groups are beginning to coalesce around a strategy to deliver sustained and brutal attacks on Mr. Trump.The plan has three major thrusts: Portray Mr. Trump as a heartless businessman who has worked against the interests of the working-class voters he now appeals to; broadcast the degrading comments he has made against women in order to sway suburban women, who have been reluctant to support Mrs. Clinton; and highlight his brash, explosive temper to show he is unsuited to be commander in chief.American Bridge, a pro-Clinton super PAC, has formed a due diligence unit of tax and business experts who are poring over Securities and Exchange Commission documents and court records related to Mr. Trumps business career.A staff member for an affiliated group, Correct the Record, which coordinates with Mrs. Clintons campaign, has collected footage of comments that have not hurt Mr. Trumps standing among Republican primary voters, but that could be stitched together in what the groups founder, David Brock, described as a montage of hateful speech that would appall a general electorate.There is something to this idea that nothing has stuck, Mr. Brock said, but that, he argued, is because the Republicans have been too restrained to avoid offending Mr. Trumps supporters.In the coming weeks, Priorities USA Action, a super PAC supporting Mrs. Clinton that effectively portrayed Mitt Romney as a cold corporate titan in the 2012 campaign, will begin scripting and testing ads that use a similar approach against Mr. Trump.As Mrs. Clinton tries to remain above the fray, Mr. Clinton would be unleashed to respond when Mr. Trump lashed out. Mr. Obama has already argued that Mr. Trump should not be trusted with the job and has told allies he will continue that charge. In February, asked about Mr. Trump, he said the president has the nuclear codes with them and can order 21-year-olds into a firefight.Jennifer Palmieri, a Clinton spokeswoman, said that she was focused on the primary, but that she was the first person to call Trump out on either side, and we reserve the right to do that depending on the circumstances.Even as Democrats prepare to take on Mr. Trump, there remains deep anxiety that the messages may not break through.In January, Clinton advisers were startled after Senator Ted Cruz of Texas released an ad that alleged that Mr. Trump had used eminent domain to try to bulldoze an elderly widows home in Atlantic City, making way for a parking lot to accompany one of his namesake casinos.The woman won the legal battle and remained in her home, but the ad, which Mr. Trump disputed, did not dent his support.Unless these attacks are effective, Mrs. Clintons advisers worry that Mr. Trump could pose a threat in some states Mr. Obama won in 2008 and 2012, including some the party once considered safe.Mrs. Clintons uneven performance with male voters so far, especially white men, could create an opening for Mr. Trump to attract Democrats and independents who are socially and culturally moderate and open to his call for a strong military, fearless foreign policy and businessmans approach to the economy. Those voters could give him an edge in places like North Carolina, which Mr. Obama won in 2008. But Clinton advisers also worry about Ohio, Florida and Democratic-leaning states in presidential elections that Mr. Trump has vowed to contest, like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.Edward G. Rendell, a former governor of Pennsylvania who is supporting Mrs. Clinton, said that he thought she would ultimately win Pennsylvania, but conceded that he could be wrong. He has crossover appeal with some blue-collar working-class Democrats, Mr. Rendell said. The key to defeating Mr. Trump, he said, was to keep coaxing him into making offensive or extreme comments that would alienate independents and others who might normally vote for a Republican nominee.For every one of those blue-collar Democrats he picks up, he will lose to Hillary two socially moderate Republicans and independents in suburban Cleveland, suburban Columbus, suburban Cincinnati, suburban Philadelphia, suburban Pittsburgh, places like that, he said.Former Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, who campaigned there on Thursday with Mr. Clinton, said the former president was girding for a hard-fought election if Mr. Trump is the Republican nominee. The president sees Trump as formidable, no question, Mr. Hodges said. He takes him seriously. The campaign takes him seriously.Theyll flip their top, and theyll flip their panties... read the subject line of a recent news release from Emilys List, a group that works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights. The quote came from comments Mr. Trump made about women on The Howard Stern Show in the 1990s, unearthed by BuzzFeed last month.Those types of comments, spoken by Mr. Trump over the years as he served as a tabloid regular and reality TV star, could help Mrs. Clinton excite suburban women and young women who have been ambivalent or antagonistic toward her candidacy.Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emilys List, said that an expanded research shop at the organization had compiled an endless amount of misogynistic and outrageous comments towards women.The strategy highlights a concern among Mrs. Clintons allies that her chance to become the first female president has not led to widespread excitement among young women. Mr. Trump is the perfect solution to the enthusiasm gap, many Democrats say.They also say that, while Mr. Trump has proved adept at emasculating his male opponents, as with his low energy slight at Jeb Bush, his insults directed at Carly Fiorina and the Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly have fallen flat or backfired. Ms. Fiorina had the best week of her short-lived campaign after Mr. Trump insulted her face and she rallied women around her candidacy.And Mrs. Clinton has benefited in her career when male opponents have overstepped or appeared to bully her.But as Democrats hold their breath for the next sexist comment, they also acknowledge a problem that opposition research cannot fix: Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton are polar opposite politicians, and Mr. Trumps direct and visceral style could prove difficult for Mrs. Clinton, whose inclination is detailed policy talk and 12-point plans.Can you imagine what hell do? Mr. Dowd, the former Bush strategist, said. She will bring up equal pay for women and abortion rights, Mr. Dowd said, and hell turn to her and say, You cant even handle your stuff at home. Mr. Clinton calls Mr. Trump ideal in the era of the Instagram election, when voters want bite-size solutions (Build a wall! Ban the Muslims!) to complex problems. Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, can appear scripted and static when she tries to hurl planned one-liners in debates.It will be hard for Mrs. Clinton to focus on policy and stay above the fray as her opponent and her own operation dig in for a brutish campaign. Hope and change, not so much, said David Plouffe, who managed Mr. Obamas 2008 campaign, referring to the slogan that defined that race. More like hate and castrate."}
{"text": "ATHENS  It was a scene of a type that could become all too common in coming months: Thousands of increasingly desperate people backed up at the frontier between Greece and Macedonia on Monday, stymied in their efforts to reach Germany. A group of angry asylum seekers busted through a razor-wire fence. Armed police officers fired tear gas as frenzied crowds chanted, Open the border!Less than a week after Austria and nine other European countries took steps to stem the flow of refugees from Greece toward Germany and other prosperous countries, the spasm of violence on Greeces northern border brought to life the perils of the European Unions inability so far to settle on a common policy to address the migration crisis.War in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and repression and economic hardship across the Middle East and Africa continue to compel large numbers of people to strike out for Europe. Germany continues to signal that it will accept legitimate refugees, especially from Syria. As the weather grows warmer and the sea crossing from Turkey to Greece safer, the number of people arriving is expected to spike, putting a huge strain on Greece, which in effect is becoming a giant holding center for migrants who cannot go forward because of the new border restrictions, but will not or cannot go back.An estimated 7,000 migrants are at the border with Macedonia, and camps and refugee housing in Athens are full or nearly so.Whats happening is that Greece is being turned into a sort of a Lebanon, where institutions are overwhelmed by the mere numbers of people, and there isnt a strategy to deal with it, said Wolfango Piccoli, a president of Teneo Intelligence, a London-based advisory firm.If Europe does not reach an accord soon on how to deal with the situation, Greece could look like a large-scale Calais Jungle, where there is no exit for migrants, the authorities are unable to cope and the migrants live in miserable conditions, he added, referring to a vast camp known as the Jungle that the French authorities began to dismantle amid angry protests on Monday.Greece, already struggling under its long economic slump and budget austerity imposed by the European Union, has requested emergency aid from the bloc to help it deal with the migrant crisis. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said on Sunday that Greece could not be required to shoulder the burden on its own.Do you seriously believe that all the euro states that last year fought all the way to keep Greece in the eurozone, and we were the strictest, can one year later allow Greece to, in a way, plunge into chaos? she said in an appearance on the public broadcaster ARD.But Ms. Merkel is under intense political pressure at home over her insistence on welcoming people with legitimate asylum claims, and without much support from other European governments. While officials in Brussels have joined Ms. Merkel in decrying unilateral steps by countries along the migrant trail to limit the flow of people, it is not clear whether European Union leaders can reach some sort of accommodation before spring brings a new surge of migrants and the potential for more violence of the sort that broke out on Monday.The police used stun grenades and migrants threw stones in the clashes on the frontier with Macedonia, which recently closed its border with Greece to thousands of Afghans after reclassifying them as economic migrants rather than refugees.That move, which denied Afghans the right to apply for asylum, was effectively a response to an Austrian decision that put a daily cap on the number of people allowed into the country and that left thousands of Afghans with nowhere to go. It also promoted fear among Syrians and Iraqis, who worried that they might also be unable to travel farther north if similar restrictions were imposed.What started as a peaceful protest on Monday by people, mostly Iraqis, who have a legitimate claim on crossing but have been held up  some for over a week  by the recent intermittent closing of the border on the Macedonian side, quickly escalated to a riot.It started as a peaceful protest. People were walking on the railway line and ran up to the border singing and chanting, Open the border, said Gemma Gellie, a member of Doctors Without Borders who works at the migrant camp in Idomeni.When the protesters reached a razor-wire fence on the Macedonian border, they pushed part of it over, prompting the Macedonian police to turn people away violently, and throw tear gas canisters over the border and onto the Greek side.Some of these people have fled war, and seeing gas and hearing explosions was brought back their most terrifying memories, Ms. Gellie said. They were beyond distressed.The Balkans have served as the main passageway for migrants, most of whom hope to reach Germany, which has accepted far more asylum seekers than any other country. Germanys warmer welcome has led to tensions with other European countries, and last week Austria and nine Balkan states agreed to put in place several measures to reduce the flow of refugees. The effect has been a rapid buildup of migrants in Greece.We estimate that we will have a number of people trapped in our country which will be between 50,000 and 70,000, the minister for migration, Ioannis Mouzalas, told the Greek TV channel Mega.Mr. Mouzalas said that he believed that those numbers would be reached in the coming month, and that 22,000 migrants were already in the country.Greece is the most popular entry point into Europe for hundreds of thousands of refugees from Iraq, Syria and elsewhere. More than 111,000 migrants have already arrived in the country this year, far ahead of the pace of last year, according to the International Organization for Migration.More than 400 migrants have died this year while trying to cross the Mediterranean, the organization reported, including 321 on the heavily traveled route between Turkey and Greece. NATO has agreed to patrol those waters to combat trafficking of migrants, but it is not clear whether the presence of naval vessels will deter the flow of people.The sporadic imposition of border controls by countries including Austria, Denmark and Sweden over the past few months has dealt a serious blow to the Schengen agreement, a cornerstone of European integration that allows the free movement of people across much of the blocs internal borders."}
{"text": "BERLIN  The Pergamon Museum is home to the famous Ishtar Gate, a monument of blue and white tile decorated with golden lions and daisies that was once the entrance to ancient Babylon. When Kamal Alramadhani, a 25-year-old Iraqi economics student, saw it for the first time this month, I got goose bumps, he said, pointing to his arm.Its from Iraq, he added quietly, through an Arabic translator. My country. A native of Mosul, Mr. Alramadhani studied economics at the University of Baghdad and came to Germany in October, part of a wave of asylum seekers that is stirring opposition here but also leading the government to look for ways to help the migrants adjust.That afternoon, Mr. Alramadhani and about 30 others  some of them teenagers who had walked much of the way from Syria  were visiting the museum for the first time, on a free Arabic-language tour. It is part of a new and growing state-financed program to introduce the refugees to Germanys cultural heritage  even, of course, when some of that heritage comes from the Middle East.The visits can be fraught. Sometimes people say: The Germans have all our heritage! They stole it! said Razan Nassreddine, who led the Arabic-language tour that afternoon at the Museum of Islamic Art, which is part of the Pergamon Museum and filled with treasures from empires past. Often, the visitors say the art is probably better off in Berlin because so much in Syria has been destroyed by the war and the Islamic State, Ms. Nassreddine said.Other times, the tours bring up raw memories for visitors who have arrived in the last three months. At a painted marble wall niche from a house in Damascus that dates to the 15th and 16th century and was inhabited by Samaritans, a community related to Judaism, some people want to cry, Ms. Nassreddine said. When they see the colors and the shapes, they get chills.Ms. Nassreddine is not a refugee  she grew up in Damascus, a child of Syrian and Lebanese parents, and moved to Europe to study in 2010, before Syria fell into civil war. She is one of 19 guides  18 from Syria and one from Iraq  who are part of a program, called Multaka, or meeting point in Arabic, which began in December and is aimed at training refugees to become museum guides.The program is largely financed by the German government, including the Culture Ministry, which answers directly to the office of the chancellor, Angela Merkel. It also draws on some private foundation funding. It offers two Arabic-language tours a week at each of four Berlin museums: The Islamic Art Museum and the Museum of the Ancient Near East (which are both inside the Pergamon); the German Historical Museum; and the Bode Museum, including its collection of Byzantine art.Educators from the museums are training the guides, many of whom had good jobs and social standing in Syria. The nice thing is to give them something that gives them a purpose, said Stefan Weber, the director of the Islamic Art Museum. The program also serves to open up new public spaces for them and to help many other newcomers find a way to the museums, he added.Multaka is one of a host of new public and private programs taking shape since last summer, when Germany began taking in the first of more than one million asylum seekers. The government has also been providing food and housing and offering language and training classes. Multaka seems representative of the spirit in which Berlin, Germanys cultural hub, has embraced the new migrants even as skeptics worry that they are straining the social welfare system.The museums have not kept track of how many visitors have come on the Arabic tours, but each week more people learn about them through word of mouth and social media. Guides are encouraged to point out the objects they find most interesting, and also to share their own experiences, to have an open discussion, Mr. Weber said.The Islamic Art Museum  which in recent years has also been involved in helping to track artifacts under threat in Syria  was founded in 1904, among the first of its kind. Most objects came from lands then under Ottoman control in an era when Western collectors bought (some critics say plundered) artifacts. The first fragments of the Ishtar Gate came to Berlin in 1903 after negotiations between Germany and the Ottoman Empire. Over the years, Iraq has called for the works return.On a recent afternoon, Ms. Nassreddines group included a dozen young teenagers from Neukln, a Berlin neighborhood known as a melting pot, who arrived with the teachers of their intensive German-language course. They raced through the galleries and peppered their guide with questions.Mahmoud Khalil, a tall 14-year-old with light brown hair and lots of energy, said he had walked about 370 miles from Syria en route to Germany. He said his favorite part of the museum tour was the Aleppo Room, whose walls are painted red with elaborate floral motifs. (It originally decorated the home of a Christian merchant and was brought into the collection in 1912 by the museums first director.)Helin Hasan, 14, the only girl in his language class, said her favorite part was seeing the high carved walls of the desert palace of Mshatta, built in the eighth century south of Amman, Jordan, for an Umayyad-era caliph. It was the most beautiful, she said of the walls, whose ornate carvings reveal the intermingling of Eastern, Western and Byzantine motifs. Ms. Hasan wore a T-shirt and did not cover her head, like some of the other women on the tour.Mr. Alramadhani, the Iraqi economics student entranced by the Ishtar Gate, was visiting with a German-language class of older students. His journey had taken him from Turkey to Greece by boat, then through Macedonia to Germany. Asked what was harder, economics or German grammar, he laughed. Surely the German language, he said.Katja Gretscher-Sad, one of the teachers in the teenagers German course, said she welcomed the change of pace from classes. Theyre very motivated, and very full of illusions, she said as she walked through the gallery. They think that Angela Merkel will buy them a house.Twenty years ago, Ms. Gretscher-Sad taught children who had just arrived in Germany from the Balkans and the former Soviet Union. Today, they are from Syria and Iraq. It pains her to think of her students futures in Germany, where even menial jobs require training certificates. Here you have to have papers, papers, papers, papers, she said. Many German employers would prefer to hire someone named Oliver over someone called Ahmed, she added.After the tour, Ms. Nassreddine was visibly moved. She said it had been her best to date. They asked me Whats this? and Whys it here? she said. It was really a dialogue."}
{"text": "For a few weeks in February if the conditions are just right, for about 10 minutes around sunset, one waterfall in Yosemite National Park looks more like its opposite  a firefall.Visitors who flocked to the California park last week, many with cameras in tow, have not been disappointed by the glowing transformation of Horsetail Fall, which flows from El Capitan.In the over 20 years I have been photographing the firefall and leading workshops there in Yosemite, I have never seen a more spectacular one, said Michael Mariant, a photographer from Morro Bay, Calif., who leads teaching trips to Yosemite.The phenomenon occurs if there has been enough snow and rain in the Sierra Mountains to fuel the waterfall, if the skies are clear and if the setting sun strikes the water at an angle that creates the illusion of lava.Mike Gauthier, the parks chief of staff, said that he was not sure if it was definitely the best firefall ever. But it certainly trumps the firefall the last few years, when drought turned Horsetail Fall mostly dry.This cascade of glowing water is a natural alternative to another, discontinued Yosemite firefall tradition.In the 1870s, the owners of a hotel in the park started dumping embers from a cooling fire off a cliff. From Curry Village, a camping and lodging area below, this happened to look like a flowing fire, and spectators would gather to marvel at the sight. Mr. Gauthier said that it ended in 1968 because of changes in the way officials thought about national parks  as sites for enjoying the natural world, not places for artificial spectacle.The current Horsetail Fall phenomenon, traditionally viewed from points east of El Capitan, is expected to last at least for a few more days, according to Mr. Gauthier, when the sun still sets at the golden angle."}
{"text": "It would be hard to imagine a more glaring judicial conflict of interest than the one the Supreme Court considered in a case out of Pennsylvania on Monday.In 1986, Terrance Williams was convicted of killing a man named Amos Norwood with a tire iron when he was 18. Prosecutors in the Philadelphia district attorneys office sought the death penalty, and got it.At the trial, Mr. Williams denied knowing Mr. Norwood. But years later, Mr. Williamss co-defendant admitted that he had told prosecutors that the reason for the murder was not robbery, as he had testified at trial, but Mr. Norwoods sexual abuse of Mr. Williams and other underage boys. Using that admission, Mr. Williams challenged his death sentence on the grounds that prosecutors knew he had been sexually abused but had told the trial judge there was no evidence Mr. Norwood had abused anybody.A state court found that the prosecutors had lied, and vacated Mr. Williamss sentence. But the Pennsylvania Supreme Court unanimously reversed that ruling. The courts chief justice at the time, Ronald Castille, wrote a concurring opinion criticizing the lower courts ruling for condemning the prosecutors.The problem was that Mr. Castille himself led the district attorneys office when it prosecuted Mr. Williams, and personally authorized seeking the death penalty in that case. When he later ran for a seat on the State Supreme Court, he advertised to voters his tough-on-crime record, and the fact that he had sent 45 people to death row. Nevertheless, he refused to recuse himself from Mr. Williamss case.The constitutional guarantee of due process requires, at a minimum, that judges be impartial arbiters of the cases that come before them. In a 2009 case, the United States Supreme Court said judges must recuse themselves when the risk that they will be biased is too high to be constitutionally tolerable.Any reasonable person would conclude that there is a significant appearance of bias when a judge rules on a case that he was directly involved in as district attorney. The conflict of interest was even more obvious for Mr. Castille after the lower court ruled that the prosecutors he supervised had violated the Constitution by hiding the fact that they knew Mr. Williams had been sexually abused by the victim.At oral arguments on Monday, the lawyer for Pennsylvania argued that a rule requiring recusal for former prosecutors would not be realistic, because many judges have prior experience as prosecutors. But as Justice Elena Kagan pointed out, not all experiences are equal. He made the most important decision that could be made in this case, she said about Mr. Castilles role.Even if the court does the right thing and rules that Mr. Williamss constitutional rights were violated, that will not fix the much broader problem of elected judges. Studies have found that when judges must convince voters to put them on the bench, criminal defendants are among the biggest losers. Elected judges hand out longer sentences the closer they are to re-election and are less than half as likely as appointed judges to reverse death sentences. Even the number of judicial-campaign ads on television has an effect: The more there are, the less likely judges are to rule in favor of criminal defendants.By any standard of fairness, judges should not be allowed to review their own past actions. The justices should overturn the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision."}

{"text": "As Chris Rock strolled onto the Dolby Theater stage Sunday night and prepared to lay waste to the Academy Awards, there was a hint of what was to come in the music playing in the background: Public Enemys Fight the Power.In an Oscars ceremony full of sly jokes told with baldfaced abandon, this was perhaps the most audacious. And in a year in which the conversation about Hollywoods systemic problems with diversity was far louder than the conversation about the quality of its product, this was a wise choice and a knowing provocation. It was a loud reminder that even though it was the academys night, control of the tone belonged to Mr. Rock, and he could bend it to his will.And Fight the Power, a punishingly catchy anti-establishment anthem by the most vocal political hip-hop act of all time, is good theme music for an assault from within.Originally written at the behest of Spike Lee for his 1989 film, Do the Right Thing, Fight the Power is built on a splatter of samples, furious scratches by Terminator X and the saxophone playing of Branford Marsalis, chopped into siren bursts. Chuck Ds speechifying is pugnacious and mesmerizing, accented by Flavor Flavs urgent exhortations.In the film, Fight the Power shrieks out of Radio Raheems boombox  a warning or a nuisance, depending on whos doing the listening. (It later appeared on Public Enemys 1990 album, Fear of a Black Planet, and was nominated for best rap performance at the 1990 Grammy Awards, losing to Young M.C.s Bust a Move.) Mr. Lee, who was nominated for the Do the Right Thing screenplay at the 1990 Oscars but lost to Tom Schulmans Dead Poets Society, also directed the songs music video, which took the form of a political rally in the streets of Brooklyn.Last November, before this years nominees were announced, Mr. Lee won an Academy Honorary Award  the only Oscar hes ever received  and used his acceptance speech to decry Hollywoods pervasive diversity problems. He declined to appear at Sundays ceremony as an act of protest. (He instead attended the Knicks game in a tuxedo.)But with Fight the Power, Mr. Lee was there in spirit, at the beginning of the night and also the end when, notably, almost the entire song played as the credits scrolled. It should be said: Yes, the song faded out before its third verse, the one that bad-mouths Elvis Presley and John Wayne, still-sacred totems of white American virility. And some of the sampled bits that gave it additional urgency in its time were gone. Questlove, hip-hops living memory, bemoaned the changes on Twitter: Confused at this new version of Fight the Power, minus 6 crucial samples  and its all too important middle finger of a last verse.Had Fight the Power been co-opted? Chuck D spent some of Sunday night debating people on Twitter who felt that way. But the way the song bookended the ceremony couldnt help but feel like a moral victory. If it came about as a result of Mr. Rocks exerting his influence as host to make sure that insurgency had a voice, then fine.If it was a stroke of self-awareness on the part of the Academy, even better. Maybe next year, theyll go for Burn Hollywood Burn."}

{"text": "It was a problem that everyone knew was solvable, but one that had yet to be solved.Engineers, inventors and tinkerers had been working on telemotion, the televista, the photo-telegraph, and the tele-vision in various forms, using well-known technologies and off-the-shelf equipment, since the early 20th century.The New York Times first mentioned the idea  it was still only an idea  on Feb. 24, 1907, in an article announcing the first successful transmission of photographs by wire.The new telephotograph invention of Dr. Arthur Korn, the anonymous reporter wrote, assures us that television, or seeing by telegraph, is merely a question of a year or two with certain improvements in apparatus.The article was accompanied by portraits, all transmitted with the new technology, of five elegantly mustachioed men. There was also a picture of Dr. Korn himself, sitting next to his telephotographic apparatus. He had a healthy mustache, too.On Nov. 24, 1907, The Times published an article headlined Photographs by Telegraph: Television Next? The reporter was hopeful: It seems not improbable, the article said, that some day, we may be able to see distant views through the aid of a telephone wire in the same way that we can now hear distant sounds.But despite this initial optimism, there was no more talk of television in The Times until Feb. 7, 1923, when a casual mention appeared without elaboration in a short article referring to Edouard Belin, inventor of telephotography and television.Now, talk of television started up again. On Sept. 28, 1924, The Times quoted David Sarnoff, vice president of the Radio Corporation of America, saying that symptoms of television are beginning to appear.By 1925, television was everywhere in The Times, but it was still an imagined television machine (Aug. 30), an incidental hint (Sept. 13), a step in the direction of television (Oct. 21).On Dec. 21 of that year, The Times reported that the competition among the radio experts of several countries, including the United States, for the achievement of television has been won by the French inventor, Edouard Belin.The reporter may have been exaggerating the accomplishment. Belins device, which involved 20 silver facets mounted on a steel disk and turning at the rate of 4,000 revolutions a minute, was definitely something, but certainly not television as the word would come to be understood.Still, the author concluded with a profound insight: The thought that television is coming does not lack its terrors. The amount of attention now devoted to listening in will be more than doubled when people can look in at all they now can hear, and what time will there remain for doing anything else?On May 18, 1939,, without fanfare, The Times printed for the first time, at the bottom of the third column in the Radio Today listings, a new subhead: Television."}
{"text": "In her stunning 2001 debut novel, Lightning Field, Dana Spiotta wrote of her film-obsessed heroine Mina: She sometimes thought that if someone saw all the movies she had seen, the number of times she had seen them and in the order she had seen them, that person might know exactly who she was. Its an observation that could serve as a keystone for every one of Ms. Spiottas strobe-lit novels  all of which concern the search for identity, and the mysterious dynamics between life and art.Her new novel, Innocents and Others, shares these same themes, and like Lightning Field, it features a heroine obsessed with the movies, and a collagelike structure that jump-cuts between her story and the stories of two other main characters. Innocents is more ambitious and tendentious than earlier Spiotta novels like Eat the Document and Stone Arabia. It aims not only to use its characters experiences to open a window on American life in the late 20th century, but also to examine how technology has atomized contemporary life and the ways art mediates our relationships with friends and strangers.Unfortunately, Innocents does not deliver on its ambitions. Despite the gifted Ms. Spiottas feel for the dislocations of modernity and her sharp, kinetic prose, Innocents turns out to be a lumpy, unpersuasive novel  enlivened by some arresting moments and thoughtful riffs, but ultimately a sort of hodgepodge of derivative scenes and ideas that have been cut together into a meaning-heavy montage.Its central character, Meadow, is a less sympathetic version of Mina in Lightning Field  another alienated woman, who lives her life through movies, craving detachment and control. Meadow becomes an avant-garde filmmaker who seems to borrow the techniques of Andy Warhol and Jean-Luc Godard for her documentaries. One of her documentary subjects is a woman called Jelly (a.k.a. Amy and Nicole), who has managed to seduce an array of Hollywood creative types over the phone, using empathy, not sex, as a lure. She is clearly modeled on the mysterious woman known as Miranda  the subject of a fascinating Vanity Fair article by Bryan Burrough  who had a reputation in Hollywood in the 1980s for her phone relationships with such Hollywood men as Quincy Jones, Buck Henry and Richard Perry.The problem is the real-life story of Miranda is way more compelling than Ms. Spiottas recycling of its elements, for the purpose, mainly, of showing how Meadow, for the sake of her art, is willing to hurt and humiliate her subjects. In this case, its the pathetic Jelly, who is not the pretty young thing she pretends to be on the phone, but a lonely, fat middle-aged woman.Meadow emerges as an increasingly cold, even mercenary figure in the course of this novel. What was detachment in earlier Spiotta characters has hardened here into something chillier  and more chilling. Meadow doesnt bother to see the first big movie made by her best friend since eighth grade, Carrie, and she wishes Carrie werent so successful. She is even more cavalier in her treatment of boyfriends, casually cheating on them and careening into affairs as recklessly as she drives.At times, Meadow resembles the self-absorbed musician Nik in Stone Arabia, but whereas Nik was seen through the eyes of his perceptive sister  who understood his brilliance, pain and shortcomings  Meadow is mostly presented here in a cold, unforgiving light as a narcissistic artist, adept at using others.Meadows first film, which makes her a rising star, features her 17-year-old boyfriend Deke getting drunk, talking to the camera and confessing to a crime that might have real consequences for him. Another documentary she makes, about the 1970 Kent State shootings (in which the Ohio National Guard fired on protesters, killing four and wounding many more), features stylized re-enactments and highly selected editing. She fully expects it to be criticized as manipulative and false, though it instead wins her critical acclaim.Ms. Spiotta writes about film with great knowledge and insight, but her detailed descriptions of Meadows craft  and her thinking about her craft  often read like didactic illustrations of the books central theme: its fascination with the ways art and technology (film, television, the telephone and the Internet) distort, diminish or amplify our emotions.The film was a stylized constructed thing, a version of reality, Meadow thinks of her Kent State picture. Not a pure, untainted object. You cut, you put this next to that, you edit this out, you ask, you enact, you show an image. It was a fictiony thing: a fictional thing comprised of pieces of real life.There are similarly lengthy disquisitions about Jellys relationship with the phone  how a voice, divorced from sight and feel, can take on a power of its own, like music. Some of these asides are interesting enough, but they are too heavy for the spindly story line, which is also burdened by Ms. Spiottas growing disdain for her heroine.Like Meadows movies, Innocents is a highly reflexive and self-conscious work, continually curling in on itself. And, in some sense, it anticipates readers problems with this book. Thinking about her movie about Jelly, Meadow worries that it was too contrived, too forced, too cheesily consequential. The same could be said of Ms. Spiottas novel."}
{"text": "In a small Brooklyn apartment, Jacob Winterhalt, a former Air Force airman, looked on as his 3-year-old daughter, Raya, and her best friend, Doris, chased each other. The girls wore sneakers. Doriss were equipped with red lights that flashed with the urgency of a distress beacon.No shoes in the house, you silly goose, Mr. Winterhalt said. Unless those are special shoes.Ive got to go to work, Raya said.Ive got to go to work, too, Doris said.O.K., said Mr. Winterhalt, 35. Have a good day.With that, he sat down at the kitchen table. The girls went back to running around the tight space as Sampa, a 7-year-old English bulldog, barked at no one in particular. Nearby, Doriss father, Joachim Carels, 39, who used to work in the fashion industry, lounged on the couch.At that moment, it was not lost on me that taking care of the two little ones had been the work of both men for the last three years.As their children grew close, these two men from very different backgrounds developed a friendship of their own, finding kinship and trust in the sometimes lonely existence of men who choose to be principal caretakers, while their wives spend workday hours at the office.They trust each other, Ana Zaldarriaga, Mr. Winterhalts wife, said during an interview a few days later at her Midtown office. I think Jake said something to Joachim, and I said: Why are you telling Joachim that? Why are you sharing that outside our circle of knowledge? And he said: That is my bro. I can talk to him about these things.They talk about their wives, she said. They talk about their future careers. They talk about their passions. They talk about their child-rearing. They talk about money.The mens bond started by accident. In January 2015, Mr. Carels (whom I grew up with in Ohio) stood outside Mr. Winterhalts door, cursing. One of the construction projects defining the Brooklyn streetscape was underway, and he found that his car had been towed.Nearby, Mr. Winterhalt smoked a hand-rolled cigarette and laughed  he had gotten three tickets for doing the same thing. The two men began to talk. They had seen each other in the neighborhood but had never really spoken. It turned out their daughters were the same age, born just a month apart.The two dads and two girls hung out a few times before an arrangement took shape: Each father would drop his daughter off at the others house for a few hours one day a week. Their wives were skeptical at first. After all, each husband was handing over a daughter to a stranger.That a genuine friendship between them evolved seems a little strange to Mr. Winterhalt and Mr. Carels, even now. Unlike other male bonds, those forged through music or sports or work, theirs was formed between two guys who did not seem to have much in common.You get sucked into the kids zone, Mr. Carels said. So its good to have a connection to reality, whatever that reality is.Mr. Winterhalt said: Any time you go through a period in life when you feel like youre alone, its nice to find someone to realize its not just me having these feelings. Theres another person whos a stay-at-home-dad who has similar concerns, with a similar personality, and we can process that with each other.Growing up on a farm in upstate New York, Mr. Winterhalt was aimless after high school. He did a stint at a community college before going into the military.He joined the Air Force in 1999 with a plan to stick it out for four years and then become a police officer. On Sept. 11, he found himself thrown from the world he knew. In his military service that came after, he traveled for assignments that he said he cannot and would not discuss.What he would speak on, briefly, were the effects of the post-traumatic stress disorder he began experiencing shortly after he left the Air Force in 2003. Those effects continue, albeit to a lesser degree, he said.Three years after he left the military, he and Ms. Zaldarriaga, who grew up in Manhattan, began dating. About a year after their 2011 wedding, when she became pregnant (on their first try, the couple said), both were making roughly equal incomes. She had risen to a great position at her company, which provides leadership development in education and business, and he earned decent money teaching at an elementary school in Chelsea and as a bartender on the Upper East Side.But neither couple wanted their daughter to spend her first years in the care of someone else. They believed their girls needed a familial foundation before going off into the world. But who would provide it?It was just kind of accepted that it had to be one of us, Mr. Winterhalt said. And Ana had the benefits. So we really didnt have a choice.I think if you talk with Ana, shell tell you, and Ill tell you, that part of her is envious that she is missing out on this time with her daughter. That is really tough for her, and rightfully so. However, if you ask me, if she knew what it was really like on a day-to-day basis, she wouldnt choose it. I dont say that negatively. Its just factual.For her, it was a hard pill to swallow, to be the one solely financial responsible for the family, Mr. Winterhalt said. Its been a huge transition for both of us. For me to be the one who relies on her financially has not been an easy pill to swallow.Mr. Carels gives the impression that he has handled that transition well. Perhaps thats because he had already put his career in the background when he got a call from his wife, Rebecca Krauss, as she freaked out while in a Penn Station bathroom in 2012.Mr. Carels, having earned an undergraduate degree in architecture, arrived in New York in 2000 and earned an associate degree in fashion design from Parsons School of Design. Afterward, he entered the production side of fashion, where he spent the better part of a decade.He met Ms. Krauss, an acupuncturist, herbalist and medical qi gong practitioner, while studying Acroyoga with her in 2008 at a Manhattan studio. Within a year and a half, they got married at City Hall, after which they moved to Colorado so she could finish her training in the use of Chinese herbs.During that time, Ms. Krauss, who is originally from Long Island, traveled to New York once a month to see clients, which is where she was on that day in 2012 when she found out she was pregnant  in one of the worlds busiest train stations.In Colorado, they had help with the baby, with Mr. Carels working full time at a bike store while Ms. Krauss finished school. When she completed her studies in 2013, they moved in with her family in East Meadow, N.Y., where Mr. Carels took over the primary duties of caring for Doris.When Ms. Krausss business took off, they moved to Brooklyn. Mr. Carels knew a return to the fashion business would mean starting over. So he stayed at home.Whatever money I was going to make was going to go toward paying someone to watch Doris, Mr. Carels said. It didnt seem mathematically to make sense. And I enjoy staying home with Doris and believe that some amount of her precociousness and language skill has something to do with the fact that I was at home with her and so engaged.Both Mr. Winterhalt and Mr. Carels can be loners. Neither actively seeks new relationships, though each maintains a small group of lifelong friends. This was something that concerned their spouses. Ms. Zaldarriaga said she knew her husband would take great care of Raya, but she didnt know if he would take care of himself.Both men said that they take a dim view of groups for stay-at-home fathers. For them, the concept seems forced. Mr. Carels tried it out a number of times, but it just wasnt for him.And at some level, why are you going? Mr. Carels asked. Are you going for you or your kid?The two fathers recently took the girls to Underwood Park in Brooklyn, talking while their daughters played. A mother commented that they must be part of some Meetup or a dads collective.No, Mr. Carels said in answer. Were just parents hanging out, like you.Besides, since they found each other, they have no real need for such a group.We joke about this, Mr. Carels said of his friendship with Mr. Winterhalt, because every time we hang out, there is some similarity that is remarkable. Some part of our life is similar enough, even though the stuff in between was radically different. There is something that makes it easy to connect with him. And the shared experience for the last three years, obviously, is enough to give us tons of stuff to talk about.The difficulties they face are akin to those experienced by generations of mothers. They, too, have suffered from a sense of isolation, often followed by the daunting task of rejoining the work force after years at home.Now, with Raya and Doris ready to enter preschool, the two fathers are feeling untethered.My passion for the last years has been my family, Mr. Winterhalt said. So I dont know what Im going to do as a job. I dont have any idea. The world is mine, and thats a great thing. Do I go back to school? I dont know. That is a little scary for me.Mr. Carels expressed similar feelings. I cant go back to some stupid job thats 9-to-5 with two weeks of vacation, he said. That doesnt fit into what weve established or what we want. Im not going to go to a bank to apply to be a teller. I have to discover how to find something I want to do and fit it in with how it will work for us.For the moment, anyway, this remains their life: two little girls running around the room, the bulldog barking, the sneakers flashing."}

{"text": "The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday ordered Bayer CropScience and Nichino America, makers of a widely used insecticide, flubendiamide, to take the chemical off the market because it harmed tiny aquatic animals. Studies show the insecticide harms species at the bottom of aquatic food chains in streams and ponds, which affects fish that feed on them. Flubendiamide is used on more than 200 crops, including soybeans, tobacco, cotton and numerous varieties of lettuce, fruits and nuts. The agency asked the companies to voluntarily withdraw products containing the chemical in January. After they refused, regulators moved to cancel the government registration required to manufacture the product. Bayer said the methods used by the E.P.A. exaggerated the environmental risk. Nichino America did not comment. The EPA said crops already treated with flubendiamide or that may be treated with existing supplies can still be sold."}

{"text": "Ever since the 2016 presidential campaign began back in 1999 (at least thats what it feels like), there has been a pattern of wishful thinking about the Republican Party. That pattern reached a crescendo after Donald Trump mostly trounced the rest of the field on Super Tuesday, and it goes like this: The Republican Party is engaged in a battle for its philosophical and ideological soul, Donald Trump somehow is interfering with that, and G.O.P. leaders are really determined to stop him from winning the nomination.On Tuesday, for example, after Mr. Trump was slow to say he was not interested in the support of David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan, Paul Ryan, Speaker of the House, said that if a person wants to be the G.O.P. nominee, they must reject any group or cause that is built on bigotry. This party does not prey on peoples prejudices.Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, talked about one of our presidential candidates and his seeming ambivalence about David Duke and the K.K.K.I condemn his comments in a most forceful way, said Mr. McConnell, speaking in an unforceful way.The comments by Mr. Ryan and Mr. McConnell had two things in common.First they misrepresented (I think deliberately) the position of the Republican Party on issues like racism and the politics of division. O.K., maybe an actual former K.K.K. grand wizard is a bit much, but both racism and divisiveness have been at the heart of the G.O.P.s governing and electoral strategy for many, many decades. George H.W. Bush won the presidency in 1988 with a campaign designed around appealing to racism and fear. Mr. McConnell was fine with Confederate flags flying from government houses in the South until the political pressure to take them down became too intense. The Republicans dont have a seeming ambivalence about this. Some are more than seemingly ambivalent, and some are ready and willing to embrace the forces of racism when expedient. Only a tiny handful truly distance themselves from those dark forces in American politics.Second, neither Mr. McConnell nor Mr. Ryan actually used the word Trump. Mr. Trump is not, fundamentally, objectionable to them.Mr. Ryan has made it clear that he will support Mr. Trump if he wins the nomination. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has already done so, to his enduring shame. And the rest of the Republicans will follow suit if Mr. Trump gets a lock on the Republican delegates. It may take a day or two, and Mr. Trump might have to do lunch with people like Mr. McConnell, but they will be lining up to declare their unity soon enough.Republicans (like those he is beating in the primaries) may find Mr. Trump annoying, and they may find his unvarnished xenophobia, racism and jingoism unnerving as a tactical matter.But the Republican Party long ago doubled down on its movement to the far right, way beyond the American political center and way beyond any kind of real conservatism. It is a party of white people that protects its richest members and feeds off the anxiety of its poorest members by directing their anger at minorities, immigrants and women.Marco Rubio is not more moderate than Mr. Trump, except in unimportant details. Ted Cruz is farther to the wacky right. The only Republican candidate within hailing distance of the American political center is Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who is a conservative but not an evident racist or xenophobe or Tea Party supplicant. And he is on the verge of being driven out of the campaign.There is no chasm in the Republican Party, unless you count the widening one between Mr. Trump and his competitors when it comes to winning delegates."}
{"text": "SHALE BARON IS CHARGED IN RIGGING OF LEASES  |  The Justice Department charged Aubrey K. McClendon, an Oklahoma wildcatter, with conspiring to suppress the prices paid for oil and natural gas leases,Clifford Krauss reports in The New York Times.Mr. McClendon is accused of orchestrating a conspiracy in which two oil and gas companies colluded not to bid against each other for the purchase of leases in northwestern Oklahoma from late 2007 to early 2012.The Justice Department said the companies decided who would win the leases and the winner would allot an interest in the leases to the other company.His actions put company profits ahead of the interests of leaseholders entitled to competitive bids for oil and gas rights on their land, said William J. Baer, assistant attorney general for the antitrust division.In a statement, Mr. McClendon denied all charges and argued that he has worked to create jobs and help Oklahomas economy while providing energy for the country.The charge that has been filed against me today is wrong and unprecedented, he said.Mr. McClendon, an audacious chief executive at Chesapeake until he was forced to step down three years ago, became a billionaire as the company aggressively outbid competitors for land leases and drilled highly productive wells in virtually every major shale gas field in the country.With him at the helm, Chesapeake and a handful of other companies helped turn the United States into an energy exporter  and pioneered hydraulic fracturing in newly explored shale fields. They ended up producing a glut of natural gas that sent them to the brink of bankruptcy as gas prices collapsed.Chesapeakes stock price has been sinking for five years now, especially since it was revealed that Mr. McClendon had taken a personal stake in Chesapeake wells and used it as collateral for up to $1.1 billion in loans used mostly to pay for his share of the cost of drilling those wells.Gordon Pennoyer, a spokesman for Chesapeake, said the company was cooperating with the antitrust investigation and did not expect to face prosecution or fines related to the matter.TENURE VOTING COULD SHIFT POWER BALANCE  |  It is time to consider tenure voting, a system in which shareholders accumulate more votes the longer they hold stock,\nSteven Davidoff Solomon writes in the Deal Professor column.\nDual-class stock is all the rage  some 13.5 percent of initial public offerings included some type of dual-class structure, according to Dealogic. \nThis creates a culture of haves and have-nots, where a vote is worth everything or nothing.

{"text": "The Westbury school district on Long Island became the 22nd in New York to agree to change its enrollment policies for immigrants after a state investigation found that it was unlawfully denying or delaying an education to undocumented children.The agreement announced on Monday came amid a 16-month review by the state attorney generals office that uncovered a pattern of schools violating state or federal law by asking about childrens immigration status or diverting them into alternative, non-degree-bearing programs.From 2012 through 2015, Westbury schools asked about students citizenship status or for their Social Security numbers, which undocumented immigrants generally would not have, the attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, said. The schools also required students to give proof beyond what the state required that they lived in the district.As a result, the students  many of them unaccompanied minors from Central and South America  had their enrollments delayed by up to six months, and in some cases they gave up.A New York Times article in October 2014 documented such problems in Westbury, helping to spur the investigation, which the states Education Department joined. A 1982 United States Supreme Court decision found that schools cannot deny access to public education on the basis of immigration status.Westbury schools were also found to have an unwritten policy of excluding non-English speakers over 16 from the public high school, instead sending them into alternative programs that did not allow them to earn a diploma. Mr. Schneidermans office identified nearly 24 students who were diverted, and found that they remained in the alternative programs from one to three years, without regular evaluations by the district.The district agreed to hire an internal ombudsman and an independent monitor to oversee its enrollment policies, and to offer compensatory schooling to students who faced enrollment delays or diversion in recent years."}
{"text": "FAIRFIELD, Conn.  General Electrics announcement in January that it will abandon its suburban headquarters here after more than 40 years sent a chill through Albert J. Kleban, the 85-year-old chairman of Kleban Properties, the largest commercial property owner in town.The news was a very devastating blow to us here in Fairfield, and we recognized the ramifications of it all, Mr. Kleban said. The tax blow will affect the real estate taxes of everybody in this town.Whats more, he added, a sudden glut of workers homes going up for sale could depress real estate values.And so, even as Bostonians were still cheering the news that the corporate giant would resettle on their waterfront, Mr. Kleban decided he had to act. Less than a week after G.E.s announcement, he let it be known that Kleban Properties would try to buy the 70-acre G.E. campus.He and his son Ken, Kleban Properties president, plan to turn the site into a technology center, with a mix of high-tech businesses and possibly an educational campus connected to a university. Though still vague in concept, it is the first public imagining of a new use for the wooded campus that has housed G.E. since 1974.The gated headquarters property, where about 800 workers are now employed, is flanked by Merritt Parkway, preservation land and residential neighborhoods. Two three-story office buildings on the site contain a total of about 500,000 square feet, and sit above 300,000 square feet of underground parking, according to a company spokesman. Amenities include a cafeteria, a gym, a television studio, a guesthouse for overnight visitors and a helipad large enough to accommodate two helicopters. About 20 of the propertys 70 acres are undeveloped.About 200 G.E. headquarters employees will move to temporary offices in Boston in the second half of this year, the company has said. Others will be shifted to G.E. offices in Norwalk, Conn., and to the companys various shared services sites, one of the largest of which is in Cincinnati. The move to new, permanent headquarters in Bostons seaport district is expected to be completed in 2018.The move means the loss of one of Fairfields top taxpayers, with a July 2015 property tax bill of $1.89 million, according to town records. This year, after a revaluation, Kleban edged out G.E. as the No. 1 taxpayer in Fairfield, with property holdings assessed at $75.6 million, compared to G.E.s $70.8 million.Kleban owns several major retail/office plazas in Fairfields downtown, including the Fairfield Center building, which houses a Fairfield University bookstore, as well as a Starbucks, a Victorias Secret and other national chain stores, and at least 10 shopping centers along the Black Rock Turnpike commercial corridor. The company also owns properties elsewhere in Connecticut and in other states.Mark S. Barnhart, Fairfields director of community and economic development, said that while it was unlikely the town would find another single-occupant user for the G.E. campus, Klebans tech center proposal is something wed like to explore, especially given the firms track record.Theyre very capable at what they do, he said, and they have the financial wherewithal.According to Mr. Kleban, G.E. is drawing up a nondisclosure agreement, which must be agreed upon before the two parties begin any talks. Truth be told, he said, he is hoping for some competition at the negotiating table.I thought we should lead the way on this and others might follow, he said. I hope that others will come to the surface and maybe joint-venture it with us or come up with a better idea.The sites future prospects might very well need some more brainstorming. Selling tech-oriented businesses on a somewhat removed suburban setting could be tough, given that the trend is toward locations accessible by mass transit, space optimization in downtown settings and telecommuting, said Tim Rorick, a senior managing director in Newmark Grubb Knight Franks Stamford office.As it is, Fairfield Countys overall office availability rate is fairly high, nearly 22 percent at the end of 2015, according to Newmarks research office. And the countys average space per employee has declined from 250 to 300 square feet in the 1980s and 90s to around 150 to 225 today. (In New York City, the average is closer to 120 square feet.)The G.E. site also faces hometown competition from a long-delayed commercial development to be built alongside the towns third and newest train station, Fairfield Metro, on the border with Bridgeport. The 10-year-old master plan for that project originally called for about one million square feet of office space, but Mr. Barnhart said the ownership group had revised its plan to reflect current market conditions and would soon submit an application proposing a mix of retail, office and residential space.James Fagan, the senior managing director of Cushman & Wakefield of Connecticut, said that given the age of the G.E. buildings and their distance from mass transit, he sees the site as more suited for residential development, perhaps a gated community, or, most ideally in his opinion, a campus for a major university. A 20,000-student institution, he said, could help draw employers to Fairfield County in the same way that Bostons plentiful supply of highly educated graduates helped lure G.E.Connecticuts behind the curve, he said. We need to do something drastic.Fairfield is already home to two Catholic universities  Fairfield University, a Jesuit institution, and Sacred Heart University  each of which has fewer than 10,000 students.Suburban office parks continue to do well in some areas, like northern New Jersey. For example, in 2010, Rubenstein Partners, a real estate investment firm in Philadelphia specializing in office markets, bought the 200-acre former headquarters of Alcatel-Lucent in Whippany.At the time, commercial brokers were not optimistic that the property would continue to attract office tenants, according to Stephen Card, a senior acquisitions executive for Rubenstein. But the firm subsequently demolished several obsolete buildings and redeveloped one section of the campus as a 675,000-square-foot office building for Bayer HealthCare. It is now building a 185,000-square-foot headquarters for MetLife Investments, he said.Rubenstein has also redeveloped what Mr. Card called a 300,000-square-foot corporate bunker formerly occupied by Avaya in Basking Ridge, bringing in light with a floor-to-ceiling glass facade, and upgrading an auditorium, conference center and other conveniences. Avaya leased back some space, and other lease proposals are under negotiation.These suburban campuses need amenities and attributes that cater to a younger work force, like on-site food services, fitness facilities and bike share services, Mr. Card said. But these campuses arent going away."}
{"text": "What was shaping up to be the first big merger battle of 2016 has ended, at least for now.Honeywell said on Tuesday that it was withdrawing its $90 billion takeover bid for United Technologies after its rival steadfastly argued that a union of the two would be blocked by government regulators.In a statement, issued a day before Honeywell holds an annual presentation for investors, the company argued again that it believed a merger would have posed little antitrust risk. Putting the two companies together would have created a $160 billion titan, with a range of products like thermostats and advanced jet engines.Yet Honeywells options for prolonging the fight are limited. The company missed the deadline for nominating candidates for United Technologies board, which passed on Jan. 28.And several important customers of the two companies  including Airbus and Boeing  have issued statements expressing varying levels of opposition to a prospective deal.Honeywells only remaining option is to persuade its competitors shareholders to put pressure on United Technologies management to restart talks. Shares of United Technologies have risen 9.5 percent since it confirmed that the two companies had held merger talks, but Honeywells shares have fallen more than 5 percent.We made a full and fair offer that would have greatly benefited both sets of share owners, David M. Cote, Honeywells chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. However, continuing to try to negotiate with an unwilling partner is inconsistent with our disciplined acquisition process.In a statement, United Technologies called Honeywells retreat the appropriate outcome given the strong regulatory obstacles, negative customer reaction and the potential for a protracted review process that would have destroyed shareholder value.Honeywell shares closed 4.5 percent higher, and shares of United Technologies dropped 1.6 percent.The announcement on Tuesday caps nearly a years worth of back-and-forth discussions between the two companies. The talks began last April, when United Technologies chief executive, Gregory J. Hayes, raised the issue of a potential merger with Mr. Cote. More talks followed over the ensuing months, before United Technologies broke away, arguing that regulators were likely to block the combination.At the same time, United Technologies stock price fell, while Honeywells shares remained stable. And the two companies disagreed over who would have run the combined business, with each jockeying for control.Yet Mr. Cote and his advisers remained convinced that a merger made sense, calculating that putting the two businesses together would have yielded $3.5 billion worth of cost savings.By late last year, Honeywell offered a new proposal in which it would essentially buy United Technologies even though it had only about two-thirds as much revenue as its rival. Mr. Cote would run the combined company, and his shareholders would have owned 60 percent of the combined business.Last month, Honeywell put forward an offer of $108 a share in stock and cash, which was roughly 22 percent higher than where United Technologies shares were trading at the time. In its statement on Tuesday, Honeywell said that during that meeting, executives at Honeywell said that such a combination would be fabulous and that they would take the offer very seriously.But United Technologies dismissed the bid later that week as unacceptable.Other big deals have hit potentially crippling antitrust hurdles. A proposed merger of Staples and Office Depot has drawn strong opposition from the Federal Trade Commission. And Comcast walked away from its proposed $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable last year as it faced intense regulatory scrutiny.United Technologies own antitrust advisers have calculated that a union would lead to at least $10 billion in overlapping sales, or about 10 percent of the two companies combined revenue. (Honeywell has argued that less than 5 percent of their target sales overlap.)Among the biggest areas of overlap, analysts have said, are plane components and heating and cooling systems for buildings.The apparent end of merger discussions between the conglomerates is not the first time an attempted union of the two collapsed. United Technologies offered to buy its rival in 2000, but was outbid by General Electric. Yet the G.E. deal for Honeywell fell apart after European regulators blocked that transaction."}

{"text": "Several automakers on Tuesday reported substantial increases in sales in the United States in February, as consumers continued to take advantage of cheap gas and easy credit to buy new vehicles.Over all, industry sales were expected to rise as much as 8 percent compared with the month a year ago, when there was one fewer selling day on the calendar.Analysts estimated the closely watched seasonally adjusted annual sales rate in February at more than 17.7 million vehicles, in part because of consistent demand for new models to replace older vehicles.February had an extra day this year, but that alone cant account for the massive new vehicle sales reported last month, said Karl Brauer, an analyst with the auto research firm Kelley Blue Book.Low fuel prices were a factor in lifting demand for pickups and sport utility vehicles, particularly for two of the major American automakers, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler.But the third domestic automaker, General Motors, reported a slight decline in sales, as it sought to reduce sales to rental car fleets that generate lower profits than sales to retail customers.G.M., the nations biggest auto manufacturer, said it sold 227,000 new vehicles during the month, which represented a decline of 1.5 percent from a year earlier.The company said it reduced its deliveries to rental fleets significantly during the month and also trimmed inventories to better match its production capacity.Our strategy is simple: grow profitable retail share while maintaining discipline with inventory levels and incentive spending, said Kurt McNeil, G.M.s vice president for United States sales.While G.M.s sales declined, Ford Motor said it had its best February performance in 11 years.Ford said sales increased 20.4 percent to 217,000 vehicles during the month because of strong demand across its product lineup. The company reported nearly a 10 percent gain in sales of its F-Series pickup truck and a 29 percent improvement in S.U.V.s.Analysts said some of Fords improvement could be traced to deliveries to rental fleets, but mostly attributed the overall increase to consumer demand for virtually all of the companys models.Fords growth in almost every category confirms its success in meeting demand throughout the new-vehicle market, Mr. Brauer said.Fiat Chrysler, the smallest of the three domestic automakers, said it sold 182,000 vehicles in February, up 11.8 percent from last year.While sales of its passenger cars declined by 27 percent, the company said that sales of its Jeep S.U.V.s and Ram pickups both rose by 23 percent during the month.Foreign automakers also enjoyed good months, with Honda reporting an increase in sales of 12.8 percent and Nissan reporting a 10.5-percent improvement."}
{"text": "A VILLA OVERLOOKING THE ATLANTIC IN CAPE TOWN$4.03 MILLION (65 MILLION RAND)This four-bedroom five-bath home in the beachside suburb of Clifton, on Cape Towns Atlantic seaboard, takes its design cues from Bali  airy bedroom pavilions, dark woods and stone tiling. Renovated in 2014, this 6,400-square-foot home sits on a quarter-acre on the slopes of Lions Head mountain, a short stroll from Cliftons white sand beaches.The homes open-plan living spaces are wrapped around an interior courtyard with foldaway glass doors and a retractable electric glass roof. There is a large dining room as well as a covered dining terrace facing the water. The kitchen has a walk-in cold room, bright red high-gloss lacquer cabinets and black Caesarstone countertops.All four bedrooms face the ocean and have en-suite baths. Additional features in the master suite include a sun deck, a circular, free-standing bathtub and a double rain shower.The private yard in back has a barbecue area, whirlpool and swimming pool. One wall of the pool is glass, so that when one sits in the courtyard, one looks directly into the swimming pool, said Adrien Epstein, an agent with Dogon Group Properties in Cape Town, which has the listing for the home. Other amenities include a 300-bottle wine cellar and a sauna.The home has staff accommodations consisting of a bedroom, a living area, a kitchen and a bath. The attached garage holds four cars.Clifton is renowned for its four beaches, as well as its cliffside homes and reliably turquoise-tinted water. Nearby Camps Bay is a tourist haven, with its busy beachfront strip of restaurants, shops and bars. Lions Head looms over all this beach activity, one among a chain of mountains that form Table Mountain National Park, the dramatic backdrop for Cape Town life. The mountain views are to some more stunning than the ocean, said Amanda Croker, an agent with Engel & Vlkers in Cape Town.MARKET OVERVIEWThe combination of a favorable exchange rate, a shortage of available properties (partly because of a diminishing supply of developable land) and the pleasant climate has driven up prices along Cape Towns Atlantic coast at unprecedented rates, agents say.With the downturn in the local currency, its making it very cheap for foreigners to buy, said Denise Dogon, the chief executive and founder of Dogon Group Properties.Over the last year, prices across all ranges have risen an average of 25 percent to 30 percent, with luxury apartment values escalating the most, said Laurie Wener, managing director for the Western Cape region for Pam Golding Properties, a real estate firm covering sub-Saharan Africa.The Atlantic seaboard has really become the place where people want to retire, she said. There are some very luxurious apartments to choose from with views of sea and mountains. And from an investment point of view, its a very recession-proof market. Its quite densely populated, but prices hold.While Clifton boasts some of the most expensive real estate in South Africa, with top-tier properties trading at well over 100 million rand ($6.2 million), according to Ms. Croker, other beach communities are gaining ground. For example, she said, Camps Bay broke its record sale price three times last year, with the new high now being 46 million rand, about $2.9 million.WHO BUYS IN CAPE TOWNCape Town is particularly desirable for European buyers because it can be reached via a manageable overnight flight with minimal time change. People come for just a few months or half the year  usually between September and April, the warmest months, Ms. Wener said.While foreign buyers used to be predominantly English, Irish or German, the mix has broadened to include Italians, French, Scandinavians, Swiss and Eastern Europeans, Ms. Croker said. More South Africans from outside the area are also buying along Cape Towns coast, a trend that has been helped along by the telecommuting lifestyle.As for buyers from the United States, we see the odd American, she said, but with the long haul across the date line, they are few and far between.BUYING BASICSThere are no legal restrictions on foreigners buying property in South Africa, but there is a ceiling on their borrowing ability. Nonresidents can borrow up to half of the purchase price from a local bank, so long as they can provide proof of earnings and comply with other laws aimed at curbing money laundering, according to information provided by Pam Golding Properties.The buyer pays for the lawyer, who handles the transaction for both parties. The real estate agent commission is included in the purchase price and payable by the seller.I do also recommend that my purchasers get an engineers report on any property that they are contemplating purchasing for their ease of mind, Ms. Croker said. The cost is usually 5,000 to 7,000 rand (about $310 to $430).WEBSITESTable Mountain National Park: www.sanparks.org/parks/table_mountain/City of Cape Town official site: www.capetown.gov.zaLANGUAGES AND CURRENCYEnglish, Afrikaans and Xhosa, among others; South African rand (1 rand = $0.062)TAXES AND FEESThe property taxes on this listing are roughly $6,000 annually. As of March 1, the transfer duty, paid by the buyer, rose to 13 percent of the purchase price for properties about 10 million rand (about $620,000), according to Ms. Dogon. On properties priced below that, it remains 11 percent.CONTACTDenise Dogon, Dogon Group Properties, (011 27) 82 449 6608; dogongroup.com"}
{"text": "The economic forces driving this years nomination contests have been at work for decades. Why did the dam break now?The share of the gross national product going to labor as opposed to the share going to capital fell from 68.8 percent in 1970 to 60.7 percent by 2013, according to Loukas Karabarbounis, an economics professor at the University of Chicagos Booth School of Business.Even more devastating, the number of manufacturing jobs dropped by 36 percent, from 19.3 million in 1979 to 12.3 million in 2015, while the population increased by 43 percent, from 225 million to 321 million.The postwar boom, when measured by the purchasing power of the average paycheck, continued into the early 1970s and then abruptly stopped (see the accompanying chart).In other words, the economic basis for voter anger has been building over forty years. Starting in 2000, two related developments added to worsening conditions for the middle and working classes.First, that year marked the end of net upward mobility. Before 2000, the size of both the lower and middle classes had shrunk, while the percentage of households with inflation-adjusted incomes of $100,000 or more grew. Americans were moving up the ladder.After 2000, the middle class continued to shrink, but so did the percentage of households making $100,000 or more. The only group to grow larger after 2000 was households with incomes of $35,000 or less. Americans were moving down the ladder. (This downward shift can be seen in the other chart that accompanies this article.)The second adverse trend is that trade with China, which shot up after Chinas entry into the World Trade Organization in December 2001, imposed far larger costs on American workers than most economists anticipated, according to recent studies. And the costs of trade with China have fallen most harshly on workers on the lower rungs of the income ladder.In their January 2016 paper, The China Shock, David Autor, David Dorn and Gordon Hanson, economists at M.I.T., the University of Zurich and the University of California-San Diego respectively, found thatHigh wage workers find it relatively easy to adjust and do not experience an earnings loss, argue Autor and his colleagues. Low wage workers, in contrast, suffer large differential earnings loss, as they obtain lower earnings per year both while working at the initial firm and after relocating to new employers.This is why Trumps charge that China has gotten the better of the United States has gained traction.When I asked Gordon Hanson what factors provoked the populist insurgencies in both parties in this particular election cycle, he emailed back:The stew, to continue Hansons metaphor, began to boil over with the cataclysmic financial collapse in September 2008, which many people left and right felt was caused by reckless financial engineering on Wall Street. The collapse and the destruction it left in its wake was, without question, the most important economic and political event in recent years.It was the financial crisis, what it revealed about government-Wall Street links, and the fumbling of the response to it that put the nail in the coffin of trust in government, Daron Acemoglu, an economist at M.I.T., wrote in reply to my questions. Once trust in government was destroyed, those that had not benefited from the previous boom years became particularly easy pickings for populist rhetoric.On Oct. 3, 2008, Congress enacted, and President Bush signed, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. TARP funds bailed out major investment banks, and were also used, as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis put it, to make loans and direct equity investments to select auto industry participants, backstop credit markets, provide a lifeline to the American International Group (AIG) and provide ongoing support for government housing initiatives  but in addition, TARP insulated the very institutions and executives that caused the collapse and the disastrous recession that followed.I dont think you can underestimate or underemphasize the impact of the bailout, Norm Ornstein, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think Washington think tank, told me in an email:On Jan. 10, 2010, the Supreme Court granted those in upper income brackets additional privileges in its Citizens United decision (buttressed by subsequent lower court rulings) that allowed wealthy individuals, corporations and unions to make unlimited political contributions. By opening the door to the creation of Super PACs and giving Wall Street and other major financial sectors new ways to buy political outcomes, the courts gave the impression, to say the least, that they favored establishment interests over those of the less well off.A Bloomberg poll last September found that 78 percent of voters would like to see Citizens United overturned, and this view held across a range of partisan loyalties: Republicans at 80 percent; Democrats at 83; and independents at 71.In March 2010, two months after Citizens United was decided, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, a program  many in the white middle and working classes perceived as reducing their own medical care in order to provide health coverage to the disproportionately minority poor.By the midterm elections of 2010, voter dissatisfaction among whites found expression in the Tea Party movement, which produced the sweeping defeat of Democrats in competitive congressional districts as well as of moderate and center-right Republicans in primary contests.Voter anger was directed at two targets  the undeserving rich and the undeserving poor.The 2010 election pattern was repeated in the 2014 midterms.To many of those who cast their ballots in anger in 2010 and 2014, however, it appeared that their votes had not changed anything. Obamacare stayed in place, Wall Street and corporate America grew richer, while the average worker was stuck going nowhere.Already disillusioned with the Democratic Party, these white voters became convinced that the mainstream of the Republican Party had failed them, not only on economic issues, but on cultural matters as well.A September 2015 Ipsos survey asked voters if they agreed or disagreed with the statement More and more, I dont identify with what America has become. 72 percent of surveyed Republicans concurred, compared to 58 percent of independents and 45 percent of Democrats. Two thirds of Republicans, 62 percent, agreed with the statement These days I feel like a stranger in my own country, compared to 53 percent of independents and 37 percent of Democrats. Here is one place where Trumps scathing dismissal of political correctness found fertile ground.Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, described in blunt terms the consequences of disillusionment with old guard Republicans:In these circumstances, Bernstein wrote, the logic supporting the traditional Republican Party fell apart:Just as animosity to Republican power brokers in Washington intensified, the Republican Party began to splinter.I asked Nathan Persily, a Stanford law professor, Are party establishments now fictions, no longer able to exercise control? Persily responded:On Super Tuesday, Donald Trump won a majority of the dozen states that were up for grabs. He collected far more delegates than Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio.The tragedy of the 2016 campaign is that Trump has mobilized a constituency with legitimate grievances on a fools errand.If he is shoved out of the field somehow, his supporters will remain bitter and enraged, convinced that a self-serving and malign elite defeated their leader.If he prevails, a constituency that could force politicians to confront the problems of the working and middle class will waste its energies on a candidate incompetent to improve the lives of the credulous men and women lining up to support him."}
{"text": "The stone-face house at No. 745 had become somewhat of a mystery to the residents of Barbey Street in East New York, Brooklyn. For decades, a woman named Gloria Knight had lived there with her husband.But over the last few years, the building sat untended on its lot strewed with garbage. Plywood covered the windows. Now and then, neighbors said, people came and left the property, but nobody they recognized.It came as a surprise, they said, when a truck from RM Trucking pulled up on Saturday, and three workers armed with cleaning supplies fanned out in the yard. An hour later, they piled broken televisions, rusted metal and bags of assorted detritus into the truck and left, said Rafeek Mohamed, the trucking companys owner. The door was ajar, but they had been hired only to clear the outside, he said.Just before 1 p.m. on Monday, the police reported a 911 call. New owners who recently bought the house at auction had made a gruesome discovery in a second-floor bedroom: the skeletal remains of a human body, clothed in gray sweatpants and a red sweatshirt, lying across the floor. Its sex could not immediately be determined, the police said.Finding a body so badly decomposed and yet intact is unusual, according to the medical examiners office, which had yet to determine a cause of death.Someone must have had no place to sleep, said Michael Cardella, 48, who moved from the area to the Bronx, and was visiting relatives. I guess they just wandered inside and never came out.Angela Moses, who lives in a house across the street with her daughter and grandchildren, said she never smelled any rancid odor and was stunned that a body could have been decaying there for so long that it rotted down to its bones. Sometimes you dont know who youre living next door to  or what, she said.Mr. Mohamed said he smelled nothing foul on Saturday. Its sad to think that a person could rot there for that long without being found, he said. He must have really had nobody.The house stands out on a block of primarily well-kept single-family homes.A day after the skeletons discovery, ceilings on both levels bore gaping holes, with plaster scattered across moldering carpets. Still, several mementos remained in place: a doormat bearing the words Friends Forever and an image of two children in a heart; a heart-shape box with a bow and a poster of a beach vista.Though filthy, the bathroom was stocked with toiletries  toothbrushes, shampoo, conditioner  and murky water filled the tub. In the grime-encrusted kitchen, a glass light fixture dangled precariously.Up the rickety stairs, the rooms were all squalid, though one had some semblance of a residence. Sheets and blankets were folded into a bedroll. A half-filled backpack gaped with personal belongings. Discarded milk cartons, with expiration dates from 2013, littered the floor.The simple house, on a 20-by-100-foot lot, was built in 1925, according to city records. Ms. Knight acquired it in 1977 for a dollar, through a program run by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.Predatory lenders persuaded her to place her house as collateral for a high-interest loan even though she had no source of income. A 1999 article in The New York Times highlighted her case and described how a judge found Ms. Knight mentally incompetent. City documents show that a social service agency was assigned to monitor her finances.Neighbors recalled that Ms. Knight moved away several years ago. In late 2012, someone complained to the New York City Buildings Department that the house seemed abandoned and unsafe. But documents show that investigators found it properly secured and boarded up.An obituary in The Sun Journal, a North Carolina newspaper, announced the death in 2013 of Ms. Knight, who had been living in New Bern, N.C., according to official records. The notice said she was 73 and retired from the New York City school system.Last December, the city offered the semidetached house at auction. The neighborhood is no stranger to homelessness, with more families entering shelters than in any other district in the city, according to a 2014 study. But the uncertainty of who lived and died at 745 Barbey Street had neighbors both curious and anxious.I just hope they take this investigation as seriously as they should, Ms. Moses said. This is not just a neighborhood for crime. This is a place where people live."}

{"text": "Every Tuesday, The New York Times will look at the week ahead in the N.H.L., highlighting hot  or not so hot  teams and players. (All times Eastern.)Oilers at Sabres, Tuesday, 7:30 p.m.Connor McDavid and Jack Eichel, the No. 1 and No. 2 picks in last Junes draft, will finally meet for the first time in the N.H.L. McDavid missed the teams game in December because of a broken collarbone. That injury, which kept him out for 37 games, makes any comparison of their seasons unfair. But Eichel is third in rookie scoring with 17 goals and 24 assists in 63 games, while McDavid is ninth with 10 goals and 19 assists in 27 games. McDavid, a Canadian, and Eichel, an American, are opponents on Tuesday, but on Wednesday they are expected to be chosen for Team North America in the World Cup of Hockey. (More on that later.)Avalanche at Wild, Tuesday, 8 p.m.With six weeks left in the season, there are not that many playoff spots still up for grabs. This game is important to Minnesotas chance of staying in the Western Conference race. Minnesota is 2 points behind the Avalanche for the second wild-card spot. After winning their first four games under their new coach, John Torchetti, the Wild lost their next three. Colorado was busy in advance of the trade deadline, acquiring forwards Mikkel Boedker and Shawn Matthias and defenseman Eric Gelinas.Rangers vs. Penguins, Capitals and IslandersNow with two Staals instead of one, the Rangers embark on a tour of their Metropolitan Division rivals, playing in Pittsburgh on Thursday and then heading to Washington on Friday before hosting the Islanders for the first time this season on Sunday. The Capitals continue to run away with the East, but the Rangers have opened up a 7-point lead over the third-place Islanders in the division. Pittsburgh is a point behind the Islanders and holds the eighth playoff spot in the East. The Rangers are 1-0 against the Penguins this season, 1-2-1 versus the Capitals and 0-1-1 against the Isles.Lightning at Senators, Thursday, 7:30 p.m.Tampa Bay is streaking again, carrying a seven-game winning streak to Ottawa. The Lightning, who also compiled a seven-game streak in January, are tied for first place with the Panthers in the Atlantic Division entering Tuesdays games. The Senators playoff chances are on life support  and so are Canadas. The Senators are the Canadian team closest to a playoff spot, 6 points out in the East. The last time no Canadian team made the playoffs was 1970, when only Montreal and Toronto were in the league.Ducks at Kings, Saturday, 4 p.m.Behind a Corey Perry hat trick, Anaheim beat Los Angeles on Sunday, 4-2. Entering Tuesdays games, the Ducks  who, if you recall, were in last place in the West at the Christmas break  were 2 points behind the Kings in the Pacific Division. The Ducks have won eight in a row and 15 of 17, and one of those losses was in a shootout.Since last Tuesday, there have been seven hat tricks in the N.H.L., including two on Monday night by Patric Hornqvist of the Penguins and Brayden Schenn of the Flyers, who each recorded his first career three-goal game. Hornqvist had only two goals this season before Monday.The Predators Filip Forsberg had two hat tricks in the past week, becoming the first player with two in three or fewer games since the 1986-87 season, when Petri Skriko of the Vancouver Canucks had hat tricks in consecutive games. Forsberg had all three of Nashvilles goals last Tuesday against Toronto, then scored three goals in the second period alone on Saturday against the Blues.Forsberg, a 21-year-old Swede, scored 12 goals in 11 games in February, tying for the league lead, and leads the Predators with 26 goals over all. A first-round draft pick by the Capitals in 2012, Forsberg (no relation to Peter) is in his second full N.H.L. season but has been collecting hat tricks since last spring. He also had a hat trick in the playoffs last season against the Chicago Blackhawks and at the world championships in May.The World Cup of Hockey is six months away, but on Wednesday the preliminary rosters for the eight teams will be announced in a series of news conferences around the world.Players have been scouted all season for the two-week tournament, which begins Sept. 17 in Toronto. Wednesdays announcements will reveal the first 16 players on each roster. Most intriguing will probably be Team Europe and Team North America.The Czech Republic, Finland, Russia and Sweden have their own teams, so Team Europe will be composed of the best players from countries not otherwise represented. They are expected to include Mats Zuccarello of Norway, Anze Kopitar of Slovenia and Zdeno Chara of Slovakia. The president of the team is Franz Reindl, the head of the German ice hockey federation, and the general manager is Miroslav Satan, a Slovak whose 15-year N.H.L. career ended in 2010. The team will be coached by Ralph Krueger, the former coach of the Oilers and the Swiss national team, who happens to also be the chairman of the Southampton Football Club in England.Team North America will consist of the best Canadian and American players under age 23, meaning top rookies like McDavid, Eichel, Max Domi and Dylan Larkin, who played in the world junior championships last year, can be on the same roster. The squad is being chosen by a group that includes Oilers General Manager Peter Chiarelli, Blackhawks General Manager Stan Bowman and Oilers Coach Todd McLellan."}

But Nathalie de Gunzburg, the Dia foundations chairwoman, said in a statement that the breadth and diversity of their experiences and expertise will contribute enormously to our work.Dias extensive collection, based in Minimalist and Conceptualist works from the 1960s and 1970s, is housed at Dia:Beacon, its outpost in upstate New York along the Hudson River, which opened in 2003 and has become a celebrated museum. But Dia began as an institution dedicated to supporting long-term projects by living artists, and for several years now, it has been trying to raise money to build a space for such works in Manhattan, after outgrowing its two locations on West 22nd Street in Chelsea and closing them in 2004. In 2006, amid board disagreements, the foundation lost its chief patron, Leonard Riggio, the chairman of Barnes & Noble, who had been pivotal in establishing the Beacon outpost. The foundations plans to build on the site of one of its previous homes on West 22nd Street were announced in 2009, but it has yet to break ground.Besides Beacon, Dia oversees widely known site-specific installations like Walter De Marias Lightning Field near Quemado, N.M., and Robert Smithsons Spiral Jetty earth sculpture in northern Utah."}
{"text": "Would Donald Drumpf poll as well?After a 22-minute segment Sunday on HBOs Last Week Tonight With John Oliver, many people learned that Donald J. Trumps ancestors were Drumpfs, not Trumps.Drumpf is much less magical, Mr. Oliver noted, suggesting that Mr. Trumps opponents begin referring to him by the former family name. Soon enough, the hashtag #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain lit up social media. And on Super Tuesday, Donald Drumpf was the second-most searched candidate name on Google, behind only Donald Trump, and ahead of Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, the senators who are two of Mr. Trumps closest competitors in the race.With Mr. Trumps sweeping victories on Tuesday, we surely have not seen the last of the Drumpf meme. But even as his critics extend its popularity, some fairness might be in order.Despite mistaken impressions, Mr. Trump and his recent relatives had nothing to do with the surname change.Mr. Oliver himself was careful to refer to a prescient ancestor. Indeed, several centuries have passed since Drumpf evolved into Trump, according to Gwenda Blair, who wrote a biography of Mr. Trump and his family. The Drumpf name appears in tax logs dating to about 1600, and the Trump name first appeared among his ancestors in Germany later that century, she said.By the time Mr. Trumps grandfather, Friedrich Trump, arrived in New York in 1885 at age 16 with a single suitcase and dreams of wealth, Trump was well-established as the family name, Ms. Blair said. In 1892, Friedrich Trump changed his name to Frederick Trump, a move toward Anglicization that was common among immigrants who hoped to accelerate their assimilation and fend off discrimination.Immigrants in modern America, however, do not often change their names anymore. In June 2010, only about a half dozen of 500 applications for name changes in New York appeared to be Anglicizing their names, according to a New York Times analysis.Name changes do remain popular among entertainers. For example, Jon Stewart, whose Daily Show is in some ways the parent of Mr. Olivers HBO program, was born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz. As Mr. Oliver noted, Mr. Trump once criticized Mr. Stewart for changing his name, tweeting that he should cherish his past  not run from it.And many politicians have also undergone name changes, notably two presidents, Bill Clinton, who changed his name from William Jefferson Blythe III, and Gerald Ford, who was born Leslie Lynch King Jr.Mr. Trumps potential opponent in the general election, Hillary Clinton, long held to her maiden name of Rodham, but she now campaigns without it.Ms. Blair said the Trump name has been particularly valuable to his brand; think of a trump card or a trump hand and youre likely to think of having the advantage in a card game.Its hard to imagine a more fortunate name to have in business, and particularly for someone whose only goal in life is to be a winner, Ms. Blair said.In her book, The Trumps, she wrote, Whether Donald Trump could have had the same success with any other name is an intriguing question."}

{"text": "A man charged with murdering a gay man in the West Village because of his sexual orientation testified on Wednesday that he had acted in self-defense because he believed he was about to be attacked. He denied that his motive had been a bigoted hatred toward gay people and said that he himself was bisexual.Taking the stand in his own defense, the man, Elliot Morales, admitted that he had gone to the West Village carrying a loaded revolver on May 17, 2013, after a day of heavy drinking and had gotten into a heated argument with two gay men he encountered on Avenue of the Americas near Eighth Street.Mr. Morales said the men followed him around a corner onto Eighth Street and challenged him to a fight, even after he took out the revolver and, holding it at his side, told them to leave him alone.They were going to jump me, Mr. Morales testified. He said he saw one of the men, Mark Carson, reach into his pocket and take out what looked to Mr. Morales like a black gun. Mr. Carson was unarmed.I thought he was going to take something out and shoot me with it, Mr. Morales testified. I thought one or maybe both of them had a firearm. So I kind of raised the firearm and turned away and shot it at the same time.It was kind of like a reaction thing, and I just ran, he added.Mr. Morales said he could not remember yelling gay slurs at the men before the shooting, as several witnesses recalled. He testified that he was bisexual and had had relationships with transgender men. Asked if he harbored animosity toward gay people, he said, Absolutely not.Mr. Morales, 36, is charged with murder as a hate crime and weapons possession. Several witnesses said they saw him shoot and kill Mr. Carson, who was 32, just after midnight on May 18, 2013. If convicted, Mr. Morales would face a sentence of at least 20 years to life.Mr. Morales became embroiled in an argument after he insulted Mr. Carson and his friend Danny Robinson while they walked north along Avenue of the Americas. The two men, out for a night on the town, passed Mr. Morales and his two friends in front of a pizza shop.Mr. Robinson and other witnesses testified that Mr. Morales had called him and Mr. Carson gay wrestlers and faggots. The two men confronted Mr. Morales. He walked around the corner, and Mr. Robinson and Mr. Carson followed, witnesses said. Mr. Robinson testified that he had called 911 on his cellphone and was urging Mr. Morales to put the gun away when Mr. Morales shot Mr. Carson.Mr. Morales fled, telling one witness not to look at him, but was wrestled to the ground a few blocks away, on Macdougal Street, by a police officer. Ballistics tests showed that the gun he dropped while struggling with the officer was the one used to fatally shoot Mr. Carson.The evidence has left no doubt that Mr. Morales killed Mr. Carson, but Mr. Morales has mounted a defense challenging the prosecutions theory that he singled out Mr. Carson because he was gay. He has argued that he is not a bigot of any type and that he never intended to kill Mr. Carson.On cross-examination, Mr. Morales said he had consumed 10 strong drinks in the eight hours leading up the shooting, including six Four Loko malt liquors and four plastic tumblers of rum. He was carrying the loaded gun, he said, because he intended to sell it to a man nicknamed Money on the Lower East Side. He had been sleeping on a friends sofa in the Rockaways in Queens, he said, and had no money, except for $20 he had borrowed from a niece.Mr. Morales, who is acting as his own lawyer, denied under cross-examination that he had directed anti-gay slurs at Mr. Carson and Mr. Robinson. Never, never, not them or anyone else, he said. I dont use that word. Period.He also denied challenging the two men to follow him around the corner to settle the dispute. He said he had felt threatened when they followed him and had showed his weapon to ward them off. Then, seeing Mr. Carson pull something from his pocket, Mr. Morales said he had fired the gun wildly as he turned to run. He said he did not know whether he had hit Mr. Carson. It was not a deliberate act; it was a reaction, he said.Youre are not saying that it was an accidental shooting, are you? the prosecutor, Shannon Lucey asked, incredulity in her tone. Yes, he replied.Ms. Lucey asked Mr. Morales if he remembered telling the police officers who arrested him that he had shot Mr. Carson because he thought he was tough in front of Mr. Robinson. She then played a tape that officers had made minutes after taking Mr. Morales into custody. On the tape, Mr. Morales laughs maniacally, saying he had shot him and adding, Diagnosis dead, doctor.I dont remember any of this, Mr. Morales said."}

{"text": "Carmelo Anthony often says these days  with a smirk or smile  that he has blocked the Knicks 2014-15 season out of his mind. It is an undecipherable blur that he simply cannot remember.This usually elicits a laugh and gets him off the hook for contemplating that absurd 17-win campaign, a team low.Who can say whether Anthonys amnesia is real? Regardless, could some memories be roaring back?The Knicks have lost 15 of their last 18 games. Their current season has begun to produce disturbing echoes of the last one: the same competitive despair, the same threat of irrelevance, the same undertones of nastiness.In the absence of wins and the good feelings they engender, troublesome happenings  distractions, in sports vernacular  tend to percolate and thrive.Another one emerged late Tuesday night during another Knicks loss, in which Anthony engaged with a courtside heckler. James L. Dolan, the teams owner, was sitting nearby, and Anthony yapped to the fan that he should ask Dolan for a refund.On Wednesday afternoon, the Knicks disseminated a public apology from Anthony through one of their Twitter accounts.We are all frustrated by the teams recent results  everyone, including me, my teammates, coaches and the fans, Anthonys statement read. Last night, a fan and I let those frustrations get the best of us. I should not have responded the way I did.How has it descended to this point? It feels odd to look back to Dec. 19. Minutes after the Knicks beat the Chicago Bulls to improve their record to 14-14, Anthony was at his locker, congenial and confident, talking about his positive mental state.Im at peace with myself right now, Anthony said. Theres nothing that can alter me.The Knicks stayed afloat. One month later, they were hovering at 22-22. But things soon spiraled downward, and the peace appears to be gone.Over their past 18 games, the Knicks have scored an average of 100.6 points per 100 possessionsand allowed their opponents an average of 108.4. During that time, their net rating, the difference between these figures, was minus 7.8, the fourth-worst mark in the league. It was worse last season, without a doubt. During the same span  Game No. 45 to Game No. 62  the Knicks had a minus 11.4 net rating, worst in the league.But there are things to be happy about this season. Kristaps Porzingis remains a rare talent. Defenses may have adjusted to his skills and he may be hitting a wall physically, but he has remained healthy and he will keep improving.Anthony, playing with a troublesome left knee, is the sole player in the league who leads his team in points (21.5), rebounds (8) and assists (4.2) per game.But all the losing has created a familiar dark aura over the team. It was a little over a year ago that Dolan battled a fan himself, sending an aggressive response to a critical email, telling him to root for the Nets.It is the second season that the Knicks have run the triangle offense under the leadership of Phil Jackson, the teams president. Knicks coaches are still admonishing players for not committing to the system, and reporters are still asking whether the players grasp their roles.As it did last season, Madison Square Garden has become a sanctuary of quietude  save for the smooth jazz, show tunes and classic rock that emanate from the speakers during breaks in play. What little noise has existed has been limited to patronizing chants calling for Jimmer Fredette, who barely played after signing a 10-day contract with the team and was not re-signed, and chants supporting the opposing team.Jackson has been mostly silent, except for an occasional post on Twitter, where he was ridiculed for comparing Stephen Curry to Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf. Jackson was quick to defend his remark, but he has not defended his team. And Dolan, for the most part, does not speak to the teams beat reporters. When Anthony invoked Dolan on Tuesday, it was a rare moment when his name re-entered the main conversation around the team this season.The irritation of Anthony, who does his job on live television and talks to reporters about it almost every day, has been most plain to see and analyze. The disillusioned sound bites and displays of frustration have begun to pile up.On Sunday, when the Knicks lost to the Miami Heat, Anthony played almost the entire second half, trying to carry the team on his shoulders. After the game, Coach Kurt Rambis said the Knicks had relied too much on him and ran the same play too many times  which, to some fans, read as a self-indicting statement.In the final moments, a loud Lets go, Heat! chant rose up around the stands. Many Knicks fans were long gone.When the buzzer sounded, the Knicks players and coaches popped off the bench to shake hands and head back to the locker room. Anthony stayed seated, hunched forward, towel draped over his shoulders. Several seconds passed. Then he got up, made the long walk across the court and disappeared into the tunnel."}
{"text": "TAMPA, Fla.  When the Yankees traded for Aroldis Chapman in late December, they did so with minimal risk. Here was a four-time All-Star closer, the man with the hardest fastball in recorded history and the best strikeout ratio of any pitcher ever with at least 300 career innings. And he came cheap.Brian Cashman pounced. Cashman, the Yankees general manager, acquired a star from the Cincinnati Reds without sacrificing a top prospect. The only downside was the possibility that Chapman would be suspended under baseballs new domestic-violence policy and the fallout from welcoming a player under investigation.On Wednesday at Steinbrenner Field, the exhibition season began with an ending. The Yankees, who were off on Tuesday, gathered for their game against the Detroit Tigers knowing what the future holds for Chapman: a 30-game suspension at the start of the regular season. No appeal, no delayed free agency, no admission that Chapman harmed his girlfriend in October. Not much controversy, either.Things get ugly when appeals delay the inevitable. Remember the spectacle of Alex Rodriguez fighting his drug ban in 2013? Chapman had vowed to fight any discipline from the commissioners office, but reason prevailed in the end. He gets an extra month in Tampa and reaches free agency on schedule next winter, something he acknowledged was a factor.I think the lesson is very clear to everybody, Chapman said through an interpreter on Wednesday. We have to be able to make a better judgment in certain situations. At the same time, I want to take this opportunity to put this behind me. I really dont want to keep talking about this, creating a distraction for my family and teammates.The Yankees are experts at managing distractions. They addressed the Chapman news with impressive efficiency: By 10:30 a.m., Chapman, Cashman, Manager Joe Girardi and Andrew Miller, who will remain the closer in Chapmans absence, had all faced the news media.A longer suspension for Chapman, for a case in which no arrest was made, might have seemed excessive. A shorter ban would have minimized a problem that had long been tacitly condoned by professional teams and leagues. The commissioners office and the players union, who quarreled on almost everything a generation ago, arrived at a sound punishment.There was a lot of time and effort put into play for a collaborative resolution, Cashman said. Thats a great thing. Its a great sign, the first important step for a process that I think is important for our sport.The decision represented a victory for Cashman, too. Perhaps Caleb Cotham, Rookie Davis, Eric Jagielo or Tony Renda will become stars for the Reds, but the Yankees needed Chapman after trading reliever Justin Wilson at the winter meetings. They went 66-3 last season when leading after six innings, thanks largely to Miller and Dellin Betances. They must maintain, or improve on, that late-game edge.We think were really blessed with what we have in our bullpen, the back end of our bullpen, and its been that way for a long time here, Girardi said. I can go back to when I was here in 1996, our bullpen, the back end was outstanding, and it was a short game. Its something that weve always tried to do here.Credit Miller, all along, with snuffing any story line about who gets to close. Miller signed with the Yankees before last season and thrived as the closer despite having no experience in that role. He has made it clear he will pitch whenever Girardi wants; no sense complicating the basic goal of pitching.Im going to try to get whoever Im facing out in whatever inning it is, Miller said. Theres one guy in this clubhouse thats pretty much closed exclusively, or closed for the majority of their career, and thats Chapman. Dellin can pitch from the fifth inning to the ninth inning. Id like to say the same about myself. Theres nobody else that has a set role.The Yankees hardly need to rush Chapman into action, with so much time to get him ready for his personal opening day of May 9. He did not pitch on Wednesday and, like most veterans, was long gone before the end of a 10-9 victory.It was refreshing to get back to baseball, as sloppy as it was, and the Yankees always make a charming little fuss over their Florida opener. There was a marching band, a helicopter flyover, and actual regular-season pinstriped uniforms and caps (the Tigers, with a bright orange spring cap, looked ridiculous).The legends took a bow before the first pitch. There was no Core Four, but four cornerstones of the 1970s  Willie Randolph, Goose Gossage, Ron Guidry and Reggie Jackson  showed up, along with more recent stars like Orlando Hernandez and Hideki Matsui. The players wore patches with No. 8 on their sleeves to honor Yogi Berra.I think we all have a chance now to focus on why were really here, Cashman said, which is baseball.Luis Severino dazzled in the first and wobbled in the second, walking in a run and giving up a grand slam. The Yankees fell behind by seven, fought back for a lead, blew it in the top of the ninth, and won it in the bottom when Jason Krizan, the Tigers left fielder, dropped a fly ball.Awful start, rousing finish. The Yankees will hope for the same from Aroldis Chapman."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Trump and Clinton Feast as 12 States Vote (front page, March 2):We ignore at our peril a very simple truth: Donald Trump can win the general election. Oh yes, we all agree that the early predictions underestimated Mr. Trump. And we continue to underestimate this man. Big mistake, because he is singularly capable of poaching votes from the Democrats for the simple reason that Mr. Trump is not steeped in the ethos of Republicanism.It would be political heresy for a Democrat to vote for a Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio  not so a vote for Mr. Trump. He may not appeal intellectually, but the strong psychological barrier of party identification is not as strong with a Trump candidacy. Even among solidly educated and liberal voters I hear alarming conversations: How funny he is, he knows how to get attention, a smart man, entertaining. All true.Already Mr. Trump has managed to create a beachhead in the minds of many people who would never say anything positive about Mr. Cruz or Mr. Rubio. As I said, we continue to underestimate Donald Trump.VICTOR PARKERMoraga, Calif.To the Editor:I find for the first time that I agree completely with Marco Rubio. Donald Trump is a very good con artist. That so many people hear something they can support in the ridiculous claims and hateful things he says, and can actually imagine him as our president, is remarkable. And very, very disturbing.DEAN FOXLa Jolla, Calif.To the Editor:Re G.O.P. Split Is Becoming Deep Chasm (news analysis, front page, March 2):With the Republican Party fissuring, now is the time for the Democratic Party to become a safe harbor for Rockefeller Republicans. Small changes  many long overdue  could create the mental space for moderate Republicans to switch parties. The Democrats should ask why would a pro-choice, pro-gay-rights, nonracist, pro-gun-control, religious moderate who believes in evolution and climate change be a Republican?I come from a family of moderate Republicans and I can tell you what they would say. Taxes and the perception that Democrats wont compromise on misguided policies. The Democrats should run on effective public policy, a commitment to lower taxes and freedom. This means eliminating red tape, making the government more efficient, embracing natural policies like legalizing marijuana, and finding ways to cut military spending to cut taxes.It also means admitting where they have been wrong on domestic policies  past and present. Whether its the looming public pension crisis, or supporting teachers unions over charter schools  these policies enrage Republicans because the Democrats have a holier-than-thou attitude supporting policies that patently do not work.The Southern strategy bolstered the Republicans for two generations  and it landed them as the party of Donald Trump. Its time for the Rockefeller strategy to turn the Democrats into the party of low taxes, effective government, sober leadership, freedom and integrity.LINDSAY STURMANLos AngelesTo the Editor:Here is Donald Trump on a stage after his Super Tuesday victories saying he doesnt understand how Hillary Clinton is permitted to run for president when she did all of those terrible things with her emails while secretary of state (when Colin Powell and aides to Condoleezza Rice are reported to have done the same thing); and Mr. Trump is facing lawsuits from his failed Trump University, in which thousands and thousands of students were defrauded, according to New Yorks attorney general; and behind Mr. Trump, nodding his head in agreement, is Chris Christie, whose associates are going on trial in May for shutting down lanes on the George Washington Bridge.Whew! Truly amazing, truly amazing.MICHAL BETZWichita, Kan.To the Editor:After Tuesday nights results, several articles seem to virtually concede the nomination to Hillary Clinton. I for one would like to see how she performs in the big Northern states that the Democrats need to win in November rather than the handful of Southern states that she is highly unlikely to carry in the fall.If she can beat Senator Bernie Sanders beginning in Michigan on March 8 and then in the other big states on March 15, the nomination will be hers and fairly won. Otherwise, the contest should continue to California and New Jersey in June.ROY WEBERGlen Rock, N.J.To the Editor:This election is a prime example of our taking too long to elect a president. Who benefits from the two-plus years of constant campaigning? Certainly not America. The campaign has become full of threats, name-calling and a total lack of civility. I truly fear what is to come before it is finally over in November.JEAN LIGHTFOOT-FARISAnderson, Ind."}
{"text": "My best friend of 60 years, whose son is to be married, called to tell me that my same-sex partner of two years would not be included on my invitation. He said that our joint presence would deflect attention from the young  couple. I am hurt and disappointed. My friend and I have shared many joyous and sad occasions over the years, including the death of my wife of 30 years, as well as happy times in the lives of our children. What would you do?STEPHENIf the mere presence of a gay couple is all it would take to pull attention at this wedding, we are talking about a seriously dull affair. Its not as if Elton John (in bedazzled stage gear) will be performing in the second row, with backup from his husband, David Furnish. Your friend seems to have missed a signal lesson of the last few years: Gender and sexual identity are more fluid than we were willing to acknowledge. And your BFFs exclusion of your mate (simply for being a man) is mean.But as I mulled your quandary, my thoughts floated back to ninth-grade Latin: Qui me amat, amat et canem meum. Who loves me, also loves my dog, which has nothing to do with Boston terriers. With true friends, we must accept the things we like, as well as those that make us uncomfortable. This applies to your pal, of course  but also to you.After 30 years of knowing you with a wife, he may need a minute longer to get comfy with your boyfriend. That does not excuse bigotry. But it does argue for more than merely refusing the invitation. Take him to dinner and remind him how much room there is in a human heart: plenty for best friends, wives of 30 years and new lovers, too. Ask him to rethink the invitation. If he declines, decide with your partner whether you should attend. (I probably wouldnt.)I go to Whole Foods for lunch. Afterward, I roam the store looking for free samples. (I think of this as a tasting menu.) There are usually  tongs for grabbing samples. But I often see people using their (probably filthy) hands to take them from the plate. I find this rude and unsanitary. I would like to shame them without being obnoxious. Any suggestions?BARRY, MIAMINo shaming here! You can pick up enough tips on that from social media. (I had to lie down after reading poor Chrissy Teigens Twitter war over her in vitro fertilization last week.) Try a friendly, I think were supposed to use the tongs for those cubes of soy cheese. Its just an observation, not a criticism. And try not to think of the hordes of finger-samplers who passed through the store before you began to graze.My wonderful daughter is planning a 40th birthday party for herself. Normally, I would host or pay for it. But Ive just recovered from a debilitating illness while taking care of my mother until her death. I dont have the money or energy for a party at my house; my daughter doesnt have room. So she wants to ask 25 guests to join her for dinner at a fine restaurant but have them pay their own way. Thoughts?G.C.Your daughter is a grown-up, which means she gets to make her own decisions. I have attended many pay-to-play dinners like the one she intends. Nothing wrong with them, as long as guests know the deal in advance. Personally, I would rather give a humbler party that I can afford than ask my guests to pay for an extravaganza.Consider a constructive alternative: offer the use of your home (that your daughter will be responsible for tidying). She can probably afford a case of wine and sparkling water  along with some tasty hors doeuvres. Add a great soundtrack and a chance to mingle freely, and Im sold. But remember: This isnt my 40th (or yours). So tread lightly.Every week, I take a group exercise class at 6 p.m., then rush to my shrink at 7 p.m. In order to make the shrink on time, I must leave spin class before the final stretch. Last week, as I was leaving, the teacher said, Where do you have to go thats so important? Annoyed, I replied, Chemotherapy. I am sorry that I did, especially because she seemed to take me seriously. May I return to class?ANONYMOUSWho knows why we say the boneheaded things we do? The only certainty is that we all will eventually. Your joke was in terrible taste. But you know that. Next time  and this goes for anyone who needs to leave a class or meeting early  explain to the leader in advance that you will exit before the scheduled ending. This way, there are no surprises.As for your chemo remark, simply apologize: I dont know why I said it. Its not true, and its full hideousness did not hit me until after it was out of my mouth. Im sorry. (And promise youll stretch later, O.K.?)"}
{"text": "HILDALE, Utah.   Andrew Chatwin watched as federal agents and sheriffs deputies swarmed this rural polygamist outpost last week, storming dairy and produce stores and a food distribution center in bulletproof vests, guns drawn, handcuffs dangling from their belts.I thought this day would never come, said Mr. Chatwin, 48, a former member of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, the sect that rules the hearts and minds of followers here and across the state line in Colorado City, Ariz.According to prosecutors, the businesses were key players in a high-desert conspiracy that siphoned millions of dollars in food-stamp benefits from the pockets of American families to bank accounts controlled by the polygamist sect, whose leaders  most prominently, the jailed Warren Jeffs  follow a self-styled form of Mormonism and dictate where followers live, how much they eat and whom they marry.The arrests are only part of the legal troubles confronting the sect and its home-base communities, accused in a federal civil rights trial in Phoenix of denying housing, utilities and adequate policing to nonbelievers. In closing arguments on Wednesday, the defense argued that the government was using the towns as scapegoats to seek revenge against a religion it abhors.Who is discriminating against whom? Jeff Matura, who represents Colorado City, asked in his closing statement, before the case went to the jury.The combined moves  the raids, arrests and the discrimination case against the towns  could signify a turning point in the governments handling of the sect after decades of sporadic action. Pictures of children wailing as the Arizona authorities yanked them from their mothers during a disastrous raid in 1953 stirred rousing public sympathy for the polygamists and, experts said, cost Gov. John Howard Pyle his re-election and kept law enforcement away.Now, some experts argue that the simultaneous prosecutions resemble the strategy used by the federal government to go after the infamous New York crime families like the Gambinos. You follow the money, said Sam Brower, a private investigator from southern Utah who connected former sect members with the authorities, helping them build the case.After raids unfolded in precise choreography on Feb. 23, here and in Colorado City, agents arrested 11 sect leaders and others on fraud and money-laundering charges. Among the people taken into custody was Lyle Jeffs, the brother and handpicked surrogate of Warren Jeffs, who is serving a life sentence for sexual abuse of under-age girls he claimed as his wives.Court papers describe a sophisticated scheme that relied on shell companies to legitimize the money earned from fraudulent food-stamp transactions  either because no goods were exchanged or because the products bought at the dairy and produce stores were taken to the distribution center to be resold or donated.Over four years, the stores food-stamp sales rivaled those at Costco and Walmart, the indictment alleges. The money, it says, paid for a $30,236 Ford F-350 truck, a $13,561 John Deere tractor and $16,978 in paper products, among other items.Meanwhile, local residents said, mothers in ankle-length dresses and braids fought in line over the scarce supplies of cold cereal and meat doled out at the distribution center.For 60 years, the state of Utah and the state of Arizona looked the other way when it came to this groups practice of polygamy, said Robert Hoole, a Salt Lake City lawyer who has represented many former members of the fundamentalist church. In the vacuum that was created by their looking the other way, a host of secondary crimes grew up, and this group became a criminal enterprise.In interviews, lawyers, defectors and scholars who have researched the fundamentalist church said the crackdown was happening now because the allegations of criminal behavior became too widespread to ignore  and because enough people who left the church agreed to testify for the government.One of them was Dowayne Barlow, 47, a former aide to Lyle Jeffs who left the fundamentalist church in 2012. He was in federal court in Phoenix on Wednesday, awaiting the jurys decision. In an interview, he said, The government, they came as true freedom fighters. Theyre going to liberate us.But some warned that it would be nave to say that the end of the sect is near.For members of the church who deeply believe in the tenets of the faith, who are deeply committed to it, things like this can actually have a counter impact, said Amos Guiora, a law professor at the University of Utah who has interviewed dozens of former church members and written extensively about them. The leadership can say, See, government really hates us.Federal and state authorities in Arizona and Utah had said they believed that Warren Jeffss conviction in 2011 could destabilize the sect, estimated to have 6,000 followers. But in practice, his influence never waned, prosecutors said. From behind bars, for example, he ordered believers to abandon the homes they were building and divert their money to the construction of walled compounds.As a result, half-built houses dot the bordering towns, collectively known as Short Creek when they were settled as a single community in 1913 by a group of Mormons who broke away from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints after it banned polygamy.Members of the splinter group set out looking for a refuge, and they found it here. Colorado City and Hildale are wedged against chiseled red mountains, a six-hour drive from Phoenix.Children are home-schooled and put to work early. On a recent morning, three young girls lined up rocks along the tall fence surrounding their home as their mother stood watch, hands on hips.Discreet signs hang above believers front doors, the word Zion painted pink on white board. The signs are meant to ward off angels of destruction, Mr. Chatwin said.For months, families have lived in tents and trailers framed by a towering fence in Colorado City, after they were evicted from the homes where they lived for refusing to pay property taxes.According to interviews, the food-stamp fraud seemed to be an open secret among people in the region  another example of a practice they call bleeding the beast.They despise the government, but they are only too happy to take from the government, Professor Guiora said.The stores at the center of the food-stamps case  the Meadowayne Dairy Store and Vermillion Cliffs Produce, which are in Colorado City  have modest selections that resemble the products found at convenience stores.It was the size of the community the stores serve and, the indictment says, the abnormally large and frequent food-stamp sales they logged that roused the governments suspicions.Beneficiaries must swipe government-issued electronic cards through a machine to make food-stamp purchases. When the dairy store reopened three days after the raid, a sign taped to the front door warned shoppers: Card machine is unavailable. Cash or check only."}
{"text": "Bernie Sanders has vowed to fight for the presidential nomination until the Democratic convention, but the results Tuesday suggest that he is not anywhere close to being on track to amass a majority of pledged delegates.Hillary Clintons landslide margins in the South and her competitiveness elsewhere translate to an overall lead of around 15 to 20 percentage points nationwide. Her support is anchored by her advantage among black voters, who represent nearly a quarter of Democratic voters and have offered her more than 80 percent of their votes  a tally rivaling or even exceeding the share won by Barack Obama in 2008.Mr. Sanders, despite pockets of strength, has not fared well enough to overcome such a huge deficit among black voters.Not even his victories in Colorado, Minnesota and Oklahoma on Tuesday will change that. Mr. Sanders would have needed gigantic wins in these states to entertain the possibility of overcoming his enormous deficit in the South, where a majority of Democrats are African-American.Mrs. Clinton won nearly 80 percent of the vote in Alabama, more than 70 percent in Georgia and more than 60 percent in Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas and Texas. Mr. Sanders cannot make up for routs in the South with slight wins in the North. He needs landslides to counter landslides; he doesnt have them.There are three times as many nonblack voters as black voters in the Democratic primary electorate. To cancel her strength, Mr. Sanders would need to win nonblack voters by about 20 percentage points, since Mrs. Clinton leads by more than 60 points among black voters.Through the contests so far, Mr. Sanders has not posted dominating totals outside of his home state of Vermont and a few adjacent counties in western New Hampshire.Elsewhere, Mr. Sanders fell far short of the targets needed. He lost Hispanic voters in Texas by 30 percentage points. He lost white voters in Virginia, Arkansas, Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee. He came very close but lost mostly white Iowa.But perhaps most striking is that Mr. Sanders failed to win in Massachusetts  a notably liberal state next to Vermont with a relatively small black share of the vote. Massachusetts residents had the chance to see many of the ads aired by the Sanders campaign for New Hampshire, which is covered by the Boston media market. If Mr. Sanders cant win in a place like Massachusetts, it is hard to come up with many places where he can.Mr. Sanders also hoped to fare well in Appalachia, where theres a large number of working-class Democrats and few black voters. But the results in western Virginia, Tennessee, northern Georgia and Alabama all suggest that Mr. Sanders trails there as well. Perhaps he could still win in Kentucky or West Virginia, but its hard to imagine him winning in a landslide if he trails in the bordering regions of northern Tennessee and western Virginia.Mrs. Clinton decisively won the handful of coal country counties in western Virginia that act as a leading indicator of the results in West Virginia and eastern Kentucky.Mr. Sanders has big weaknesses among key blocs of nonblack voters: Hispanics, white voters in the South, affluent white voters and older white voters. It would be very hard for Mr. Sanders to win nonblack voters by more than 20 points while facing resistance from any of these groups.None of this means that the race ends quickly. Democratic delegates are awarded proportionally, so Mrs. Clinton would need time to clinch a majority of pledged delegates. Mr. Sanders has a loyal base of supporters who could easily fund an insurgent campaign well past the point when it is even plausible to suggest he could win the nomination.But if the race continues as it has to date, Mr. Sanders will suffer serious losses over the next two weeks. Mrs. Clinton could approach or exceed 80 percent of the vote in Mississippi and Louisiana. She could win 60 percent of the vote in Michigan, a state where black voters represent an above-average share of the electorate. Mrs. Clinton would be poised for a clean and decisive sweep on March 15, when five big states with large numbers of black voters  Illinois, Missouri, Florida, North Carolina and Ohio  cast ballots.Even then, Mrs. Clinton will not have a majority of pledged delegates. Only half will have been awarded. But Mr. Sanders would need to win by around 20 points from that point on to catch up.The results Tuesday show that outcome is highly unlikely. There is no progressive majority for a political revolution in the Democratic Party without the support of black voters."}

{"text": "What could be more alien than a virus? Its a nanobiological weapon  a microscopic protein shell holding a few genes that hijack a cells internal machinery, forcing it to make new viruses. The battles we fight with these alien enemies brings malaise, scars and even death.Yet as foreign as viruses may seem, the boundary between us and them is turning out to be remarkably blurry. We use DNA from viruses to do things that are essential to our own survival, scientists are finding. Somehow, we have managed to domesticate some of these invaders.A number of viruses replicate by inserting their DNA into our own genes. On rare occasions, their genes get passed down to future generations.At first, the newly acquired genes behave a lot like regular virus genes. They can still coax host cells to make full-fledged viruses that can escape and infect other victims.But over the generations, they lose the ability to escape human cells. They can still make copies of themselves, but those copies get incorporated into the host cells DNA. Over time these so-called endogenous retroviruses lose even the ability to replicate, becoming harmless fragments adrift in the human genome.Endogenous retroviruses first invaded the cells of our primate ancestors more than 50 million years ago. Scientists have identified over 100,000 of these fragments in the human genome, accounting for 8 percent of our DNA.Some of these fragments have become part of our biology and perform tasks that benefit us. A host essentially takes over a viral gene and puts it to work for its own ends, said Aris Katzourakis, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford.Human cells may have even co-opted viral DNA for a particularly ironic purpose: to fight other viruses.Twenty years ago, British scientists investigated a virus-fighting protein called Fv1. It protects mice by latching onto invading viruses and preventing them from inserting their DNA into the genome of a mouse cell. The gene that encodes Fv1 came originally from a mouse-infecting virus, the researchers discovered.Other proteins produced by viral DNA block the receptors through which newcomer viruses invade. Some viral proteins disrupt the replication of attacking viruses, leaving them unable to invade other cells.On Thursday in the journal Science, scientists reported that human ancestors  also harnessed viral DNA to rewire their own genetic circuitry.Guillaume Bourque, a geneticist at McGill University who was not involved in the study, praised it for revealing a new way in which evolution harnessed viral DNA to strengthen the immune system. In that sense, its a first, he said.To fight invading viruses, a cell needs to turn on many genes at once. The genetic switches that make this possible are stretches of DNA next to each gene, which are themselves activated by proteins.One such protein is interferon, which is produced when a cell is attacked by a virus. Interferon turns on genes that cells use to defend themselves.Cedric Feschotte and his colleagues at the University of Utah wondered if our cells harnessed viral gene switches to turn on immune genes. They discovered many pieces of viral DNA sitting next to genes that belong to the interferon network.The scientists edited the DNA of human cells they grew in a dish, chopping out some of the viral switches near interferon-responsive genes. Then they exposed those cells to interferon. The immunity genes, they found, barely woke up.In another experiment, the team exposed the altered cells to viruses and found that the cells mounted only a weak defense. They became more susceptible to infection, Dr. Feschotte said.The results suggest that many of the gene switches that help defend our cells from viruses actually came from viruses.Dr. Feschotte noted that a number of viruses that infect humans today have gene switches that turn on their genes when they sense their host cells have launched an interferon defense. Such gene switches would have been easily captured by our own cells.The new study adds even more evidence of the importance of viral DNA in our evolution. By spreading their DNA around our genome, viruses provided us with new switches that our cells could harness.But understanding the full effect of viruses on our evolution will take years, according to Dr. Feschotte. Its the sort of thing that I think about night and day, he said."}
{"text": "Its all about contradictions, said Diors makeup director, Peter Philips, about the look he created for the houses fall/winter 2016 show today. This seasons collection mixed prints with patterns  so Philips said he wanted the makeup to reflect a similar attitude. The look he had in mind, he said, was really sophisticated, with intense, almost dangerous lips on this beautiful, even, alabaster skin, and rebellious clumpy lashes.To achieve that, he made models lips an intense purple with black undertones. He began by contouring lips with Dior Contour lipliner in Poison, a deep purple lip pencil, and topped it off with two coats of the new Rouge Dior lipstick in Poison and a high-shine gloss right before the show for added glamour. On the eyes, he swiped Diorshows Maximizer 3D Triple Volume lash primer along with two coats of Diorshow Iconic Overcurl Waterproof mascara, applied in a swirling motion to create clumps. Its a bit more punkish, Philips said.The hairstylist Guido Palau also ran with the idea of contradiction.

{"text": "Belfast pubs pop up from time to time in the work of Ciaran Carson, one of the citys greatest writers and chroniclers.

Its a chilling expression of the uncertainty and fear endured by the people of Belfast during the worst of times.That history still keeps many tourists away from Belfast.

{"text": "For the designer Hussein Chalayan, technology is an essential part of designing a collection. Its evident in the way he carefully describes his ideas for his performative runway shows  but also in the way he explains his process.For me, it always starts with the idea and the piece Im making. The way its presented comes after, he says. (Today, Chalayan showed his fall/winter 2016 collection in Paris, which was full of dresses and blouses printed with technical drawings.)In the more than 20 years that hes been working in fashion, Chalayans runway offerings have felt more like conceptual performances than fashion shows. In spring/summer 2007, he showed garments that were wired to transform from short to long; for his fall/winter 2000 collection, a coffee table transformed into a skirt as a model attached it to her belt loops; and last season, paper dresses literally dissolved on the runway under shower heads.This week, some of Chalayans most technologically advanced work will go on view at Bostons Museum of Fine Art in its #techstyle exhibition  alongside pieces by Iris Van Herpen, Alexander McQueen, Viktor & Rolf and Mary Katrantzou. As Pam Parmal, the chairwoman of the museum, was preparing for the show last spring, she commissioned Chalayan to make a mechanical dress  dubbed The Possessed Dress  for the exhibition. The result was surprisingly accurate: a garment that reacts to movement and changes shape as its worn, in turn impacting the wearers movement. The dress will debut when the show opens this weekend, though it was worn by a dancer earlier this fall in a performance called Gravity Fatigue at Sadlers Well in London. (That performance was captured in a video that debuts exclusively here.) According to Chalayan, the dress reminds him of the fashion risks he took in the 90s. It could have broken during the performance, he says. Theres always a risk element in all of my work.But when it comes to actually wearing his pieces, Chalayan is adamant that he is primarily a designer for consumers. There are the pieces he creates for art  and then there are things he designs to be worn. To be honest with you, he says, the pieces we do that involve technology are only prototypes. Ninety-nine percent of my collections are wearable."}
{"text": "Milan  THE British have a reputation for being calm under pressure. Its a stereotype, sure, but its something I noticed time and again in the decades I spent working in and reporting on the country, from my interactions on the street to the goings-on in Parliament. Its written into their literature and their language, all of which seems intended to remind the world of a simple fact: They will not overreact. Rudyard Kiplings famous lines  If you can keep your head when all about you/Are losing theirs and blaming it on you  are not just words from a poem. Together, they express Britains creed.Admirable, of course. But when it comes to Europe these days, the British are not keeping their heads at all. The prelude to the referendum on Britains membership in the European Union, to be held on June 23, is turning out to be everything but calm and composed. The British are excitable, passionate, emotional.The two camps  should we stay or should we go?  have been at each others throats for some time. The debates on TV and in Parliament regularly devolve into shouting matches. Concessions recently gained by Prime Minister David Cameron in Brussels will not change this. The decision of his rival Mayor Boris Johnson of London to support the Brexit camp will make the struggle even more heated.The British have always looked down on Southern Europeans  including us Italians  as dangerously emotional. But this time, they are following our lead. And this is unfortunate, as the rational arguments are all on one side.In the event of a Brexit, jobs will go. The City  their all-important financial center  will suffer. Some support the move as a way to regain a measure of lost sovereignty, but as The Economist reminds us, Britain is already enmeshed in the world as a party to hundreds of treaties, all of which constrain its freedom to operate on the global stage. If sovereignty is the absence of mutual interference, according to the magazine, the most sovereign country in the world is North Korea.This passionate turn by Britain  actually, England and Wales; if Northern Ireland and Scotland could, theyd stay put  is not particularly surprising. The passion is not only about Europe, and its not entirely new. The warming of the English sang-froid has been going on for some time.I first noticed a growing propensity for the English to overindulge their feelings in the wake of the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. The composure of the funeral guests was in stark contrast to the behavior of the crowd outside Westminster Abbey: emotional, bereft, even distraught. There were not only tears, there was hugging. London was not London that day, it was Rome or Naples; it wore its heart on its sleeve, like New York. It was an unrecognizable city, its nerves frayed, sharing its grief. It was the first proof, to my eyes, that the English were losing their imperturbability.The funeral was an inflection point, but it wasnt a beginning. It merely highlighted changes that had been underway for decades. When I first encountered England as a student, it seemed that, aside from the few who took part in the Swinging 60s and 70s, the English didnt know how to have fun. But that soon began to change. They ventured abroad on vacation. Long before the global public took notice, English chefs were learning to cook and serve actual food, and dining out  al fresco, even  became something people did for fun, not just sustenance.So it has continued apace. And its not just about having a good time; the English have learned to abandon stoicism and silent suffering. Colleagues argue, friends open their hearts, couples break up instead of putting up with each other for years. Theyve stopped hiding their feelings as if they were a nasty rash. If theyre happy, they laugh. If in pain, they cry. And if they disagree, they shout. Just like the Italians.The rise of Boris Johnson is emblematic. A bombastic former journalist in charge of London? Until a few years ago, inconceivable. In the new excitable Britain, quite normal. And he may end up at 10 Downing Street, if his Brexit gamble pays off.The rest of Europe can only watch this new trend  and worry, as it could lead to an irrational decision on June 23. Awash with migrants, threatened by terrorism, let down by its eastern members, flanked by a nervous Russia and a volatile North Africa, the European Union can only hope that the new, emotional Britain will not get carried away.Unfortunately, it might. One even hears calls for the Dunkirk spirit  ironically, a reference to a great triumph by the old, reserved Britain  to rally supporters of a Brexit against the union.For once, leave it to an Italian to sound a note of reason: Come off it. To be alone against enemies in 1940 was heroic. To be alone among friends in 2016 would be absurd."}

{"text": "So thats what a civil war looks like on a debate stage. For two hours in Detroit, Donald J. Trump and the three men who want to stop him from getting the Republican nomination battled over his pronouncements on foreign policy, his business record and his past views on overseas wars.It was not a strong debate for Mr. Trump, who was on the defensive throughout. And yet, that has never mattered before.On the one hand, Mr. Trumps affirmative case for himself began with a veiled joke about his genitalia, and never really went far from there. On the other hand, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida spent almost all of their time making a case against Mr. Trump rather than herald their candidacies. The Republican Party fractured onstage, making the bitter Democratic primary fight of 2008 between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama seem tame.It was hard to keep track of all the invective hurled at Mr. Trump, and its why the speech that Mitt Romney made against him hours earlier might have been more effective. Mr. Cruz, Mr. Rubio and the three moderators offered a jumble of attacks and criticisms against Mr. Trump, creating a lot of noise. The issue that seemed likeliest to stick was the continuing lawsuit over Trump University, which, in a surreal moment for a major candidate, Mr. Trump called a minor civil case.Gov. John R. Kasich of Ohio declined to join in the mudslinging, and insisted that he had a positive vision for the country. But he also repeatedly declined to directly answer what was asked of him, shifting to a topic he preferred.While Mr. Trumps rivals landed some blows against him, theyve chosen to take him on most strongly when he is a 10-state winner. Perhaps the most important moment of the debate was at the end: After calling Mr. Trump uninformed, dangerous and ill-suited for the presidency, both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio said they would support him as the partys nominee. For Mr. Rubio, who is struggling not to lose his home state of Florida on March 15, it could be a dangerous statement.In the meantime, four more states will vote on Saturday, with a primary in Louisiana and caucuses in Maine, Kansas and Kentucky, states where Mr. Cruz could perform well."}
{"text": "KURE BEACH, N.C.   On a recent frigid night, anxious residents, many in Protect Our Coast sweatshirts, packed the town hall here, spilled onto the lawn, and then erupted in cheers as their town government gaveled in a resolution urging President Obama to block oil drilling off their shoreline. Some things are just too precious to risk, Mayor Emilie Swearingen said.That afternoon, 140 miles inland in Raleigh, the state capital, Obama administration officials and oil company representatives had outlined plans to move forward with the drilling before a very different crowd, and state lawmakers liked what they heard. Youre talking about creating over 100,000 jobs, said Michael Hager, the House Republican leader. Youre doggone right this is good for the state.Within weeks, the Obama administration is expected to release a proposal to open up vast tracts of federal waters in the southern Atlantic to oil and gas drilling for the first time, and a divide is growing between the Southeasts coast and its landlocked capitals. The plan, written by the Interior Department, is expected to delineate the waters that would eventually be auctioned and leased to energy companies, which in turn would bring the drilling industry to the banks of Georgia, Virginia and North and South Carolina, along with thousands of oil rigs well over the horizon from the beach.The move has the backing of the Republican governors of Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina, and the Democratic governor of Virginia, along with Republican majorities in all those state legislatures. From Raleigh to Richmond, statehouse denizens see new jobs and billions of dollars from royalty revenues to improve roads, schools and public salaries. Among the highest profile politicians in the capitals, at least one, Virginias lieutenant governor, Ralph S. Northam, is opposed, although his voice is lonely. Last Thursday, he sent a letter to Obama administration officials asking them to exclude Virginias waters from the offshore drilling plan.I grew up on Virginias Eastern Shore and have worked just about every job one might have on the Chesapeake Bay, he wrote.Coastal residents in towns and cities like Norfolk, Charleston and Kure Beach share his concerns  and see potential disaster, even if the rigs are no less than 50 miles offshore and well out of sight. Fearful of a repeat of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, which killed 11 workers and spewed 200 million gallons of crude into the Gulf of Mexico, at least 106 coastal towns in the Southeast have passed resolutions urging the Interior Department not to move ahead. More than 80 East Coast state legislators and the owners of about 1,000 coastal businesses have signed letters to Mr. Obama opposing the drilling.For an uneducated guy who needs a job, its a good opportunity, allowed John Hicks, a retired tool and die worker, fishing off the pier in Kure Beach. But I also think about what it means for my 11-year-old daughter. An accident that messes up the coast could destroy her future. And I guess I care more about her future.Even if the rigs are out of sight, some opponents fear the transformation of the quiet Outer Banks into bustling oil towns.Our area has a billion-dollar tourist industry, said Monica Thibodeau, a member of the Town Council in Duck, N.C. The risk of drilling isnt worth losing that.The split is more regional than partisan. Coastal Republicans fear the destruction of their tourist industries as much as seaside Democrats, while landlocked members of both parties envision new revenue for schools and highways.Representative Mark Sanford, a former South Carolina governor and a conservative Republican from Charleston, is fiercely critical of his states current Republican governor, Nikki R. Haley, for her support of the drilling. Its a lesson to how to be tone deaf to the American public, he said. Hearings were held in this congressional district and communities up and down the coast, and the response was overwhelming  they came out with resolutions against the drilling. There is an amazing disconnect between what people are saying in the statehouses and in the areas that would be most impacted.In Raleigh, State Representative Rodney Moore, Democrat of Charlotte, saw things the way Ms. Haley does: Its a good thing if it can generate revenue for our state, if it can be done safely.The fight is playing out as a global oil glut has driven down prices to more than 10-year lows and depressed domestic exploration and extraction. But the industry sees the Atlantic drilling, which would not start for at least five years, as a long-term investment in a future in which oil prices rebound and supplies remain volatile.If theres one thing for sure in the oil and gas industry, its change, said Andrew Radford, a policy adviser for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry lobby. Having new exploration opportunities is really important for the industry to replace the resources were producing now.The Atlantic Coast States interest in pursuing drilling off their shores is relatively recent, as is the legal authority to do that work. While offshore drilling has been an integral part of the coastal economy of the Gulf of Mexico since the 1940s, lawmakers from both parties in the Atlantic Coast States resisted the push by oil companies to explore Atlantic waters, supporting a longstanding legal moratorium on Pacific and Atlantic coastal drilling. That calculus changed after a 2006 law, written by former Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, which for the first time required oil companies to pay a portion of offshore drilling royalties directly to nearby Gulf Coast states.Until passage of that law, oil companies drilling in federal waters were required to pay royalties only to the United States Treasury. Since passage, Louisiana alone has taken in more than $10 billion in new royalty revenue.Coastal lawmakers persuaded Congress to lift the offshore drilling ban in 2008, hoping the Landrieu legislation could be expanded to include their states, and they have since pressed Mr. Obama to lease the coastal waters for drilling.The Interior Department estimates there are 3.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil on the Atlantics outer continental shelf and 31.3 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. Energy industry experts say the true reserves may be far greater.Environmentalists are furious with Mr. Obama.This is the exact opposite of what he should be doing, said Jacqueline Savitz, a vice president of Oceana, an environmental group that is aggressively campaigning in the coastal states to build local opposition to the drilling.But Obama administration officials say they are listening to the elected officials in the Southeastern states. The administration has not advanced plans to drill off the northeast Atlantic or Pacific coastlines, where governors are still opposed to it.Almost every decision we make is about balancing the economic potential and the environmental consequences, said Abigail Ross Hopper, who directs the Interior Departments Bureau of Ocean Energy Management.The administration also points to its efforts to improve drilling safety ahead of expanding offshore oil exploration. The Interior Department is expected in the coming weeks to complete new safety regulations on offshore drilling equipment, intended specifically to prevent the failures that led to the Deepwater Horizon explosion.The forthcoming Interior Department proposal will not be the last word. The administration will continue to take public comment on the proposal until it finishes the drilling plan later this year. In response, the oil and gas industry and environmental groups are ramping up advocacy campaigns. Environmental groups are a constant presence at coastal town hall meetings and are planning advertising and telephone campaigns to urge more voters to speak out.The American Petroleum Institute has become a regular fixture in Southeastern statehouses and town hall meetings and is paying to host events coordinated with local schools to highlight job opportunities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.Oil industry officials have also sought to allay fears that oil drilling would hurt tourist towns. The development will not be in small communities; it will be in ports and industrial areas, Mr. Radford told the Raleigh meeting.So far, the pro-drilling faction is winning. But the fight has begun to reshape local politics. In Kure Beach, Ms. Swearingens predecessor as mayor, Dean Lambeth, supported drilling, had won three terms and hoped to win a fourth. Last year, Ms. Swearingen ran against him with an anti-drilling stance  and won."}
{"text": "For decades, Australia has run the most advanced and comprehensive atmosphere and ocean monitoring programs in the Southern Hemisphere, providing critical information not only for a nation that is already the driest on earth and fast getting drier, but also for a world in urgent need of such data to search for ways to cope with climate change.Last month, to the dismay of climate scientists around the world, Australias federally financed science agency  the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, or Csiro  announced plans to shift its focus to commercially viable projects and cut or reassign 350 researchers. The decision, as more than 3,000 climate scientists have declared in an open letter to the Australian government, demonstrates a deplorable misunderstanding of the importance of basic research into what is arguably the greatest challenge facing the planet.Larry Marshall, a Silicon Valley technology entrepreneur and venture capitalist who returned to Australia in January 2015 to take charge of Csiro, explained the change in the agencys mission by saying that climate change was now a settled question and the new question is what do we do about it and how do we find solutions for the climate we will be living with. The decision did not come entirely out of the blue: Australias national climate policy has been in political flux for more than a decade, and in May 2014, Csiros budget was severely cut and almost 1,000 positions were eliminated. But climate scientists were stunned by the severity and illogic of Dr. Marshalls decision.Certainly there are good reasons for research institutes like Csiro to cooperate with industry in the search for ways to adapt to a warming planet. But to do this at the expense of research and monitoring  undermining the search for commercially viable solutions that Csiro proposes to join  makes no sense. Long-term research on carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, and on changing ocean and weather processes, is essential to learn what lies ahead and how to prepare for it. Moreover, as the open letter from the scientists put it, Australia is a canary in the climate change coal mine, spanning different climate zones and experiencing steady decreases in rainfall.The cutbacks could also obstruct Australias role in supporting the landmark climate agreement reached in Paris in December, which, among other things, calls on scientifically advanced countries like Australia to assist developing countries with advice and support.Lead scientists from major United States organizations, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the NASA-sponsored Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment, have begun quietly urging the Australian government to reverse course. At the very least, the government should suspend the changes at Csiro and allow an independent review of whether they are in the best interests of Australia, the Southern Hemisphere or the earth."}
{"text": "Honolulu  OVER the past two decades as a professor, Ive grown thousands of plants, studying how their biology shifts in response to our changing environment. Soon Ill begin to design and build my fourth laboratory; Ill teach classes and take on more staff members, as I do every year. Like all professors, I also do a lot of extra jobs for which I was never trained, such as advising former students as they navigate the wider world. Last year, after one of my most talented students left to start her next adventure, she would text me now and then: This is such a great place, I am learning so much here and I know this is where I am supposed to be.Then, a month ago, she wrote and asked me what to do. She forwarded an email she had received from a senior colleague that opened, Can I share something deeply personal with you? Within the email, he detonates what he described as a truth bomb: All I know is that from the first day I talked to you, there hadnt been a single day or hour when you werent on my mind. He tells her she is incredibly attractive and adorably dorky. He reminds her, in detail, of how he has helped her professionally: I couldnt believe the things I was compelled to do for you. He describes being near her as exhilarating and frustrating at the same time and himself as utterly unable to get a grip as a result. He closes by assuring her, Thats just the way things are and youre gonna have to deal with me until one of us leaves.Women are no longer a minority within higher education. According to the most recent statistics released by Unesco, womens enrollment in graduate education in the United States has been greater than mens for each of the last 30 years; as of 2012, there were 13 women enrolled for every 10 men. Yet, every school year, science, technology, engineering and math programs  known as the STEM fields  shed women the way the trees on campus lose their leaves in the fall.Within my own field, physical sciences, the results of this shedding were clear. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, seven B.S. degrees are granted to women for every 10 granted to men; three M.S. degrees granted to women for every five granted to men; one Ph.D. degree granted to a woman for every two granted to men. The absence of women within STEM programs is not only progressive, it is persistent  despite more than 20 years of programs intended to encourage the participation of girls and women.Plenty of explanations have been offered as to why women leave science, but the reason doesnt appear to be performance. The University of Washington found no difference in G.P.A. between the women who remained and those who transferred out of its STEM programs from 1991 to 1996. Within the same study, women reported both isolation and intimidation as barriers blocking their scholarly path; and while 23 percent of freshmen reported not having experienced these barriers, only 3 percent of seniors did.In the rare case when a female scientist becomes a faculty member, she finds herself invested in the very system that is doing the weeding, and soon recognizes that sexual harassment is one of the sharpest tools in the shed. My own experiences as a student, scientist and mentor lead me to believe that such harassment is widespread. Few studies exist, but in a survey of 191 female fellowship recipients published in 1995, 12 percent indicated that they had been sexually harassed as a student or early professional. My experiences have also convinced me that sexual harassment is very rarely publicly punished after it is reported, and then only after a pattern of relatively egregious offenses.The evasion of justice within academia is all the more infuriating because the course of sexual harassment is so predictable. Since I started writing about women and science, my female colleagues have been moved to share their stories with me; my inbox is an inadvertent clearinghouse for unsolicited love notes. Sexual harassment in science generally starts like this: A woman (she is a student, a technician, a professor) gets an email and notices that the subject line is a bit off: I need to tell you, or my feelings. The opening lines refer to the altered physical and mental state of the author: Its late and I cant sleep is a favorite, though Maybe its the three glasses of cognac is popular as well.The author goes on to tell her that she is special in some way, that his passion is an unfamiliar feeling that she has awakened in him, the important suggestion being that she has brought this upon herself. He will speak of her as an object with shiny hair or sparkling eyes  testing the waters before commenting upon the more private parts of her body. Surprisingly, he often acknowledges that he is doing something inappropriate. Ive seen Of course you know I could get fired for this in the closing paragraph; the subject line of the email sent to my former student was NSFW read at your own risk!So much for the contents of the first email; now lets picture its recipient. Shes shocked: Is this for real? Shes confused: Did she do something to make him think she wanted this? Shes worried: She has to see him tomorrow. Her thesis isnt done, and she still needs his signature. What if he says no? Shes scared: If she rebuffs him, will he get angry?The scientific method may be impartial, but the scientific culture is not. From grad-school admission on up through tenure, every promotion can hinge on a recommendation letters one key passage of praise, offered  or withheld  by the most recent academic adviser. Given the gender breakdown of senior scientists, most often that adviser is a man.Perhaps she decides to ignore this first email  and this is often the case  knowing that she has little to gain, and a lot to lose, from a confrontation. Once satisfied with her tendency toward secrecy, the sender then finds a way to get her alone: invites her to coffee, into his office, out for some ostensibly group event. At said meeting he will become tentatively physical, insisting that if people knew, they just wouldnt understand. At this point, any objection on her part wouldnt just be professionally dangerous, it would seem heartless  and shes not a horrible person, is she?Then there are conferences, field trips, cocktail hours and retreats, whispering co-workers, rolling eyes and sadly shaking heads. On and on it goes, and slowly she realizes that hes not going to stop because he doesnt have to. She thought she was there to learn, to work and to be useful. She feels stupid, and shes been told that stupid is the opposite of what a scientist is supposed to be. She wants to go back in time, before this whole mess happened, and have it not happen. She knows she cant have that, and so she starts to want the one thing that she feels she can have at this point: She wants out of science.Brilliant men make for good copy, even when they fail at their jobs. Recently, reports of sexual harassment and assault within science departments at the University of California, Berkeley, Caltech and the University of Chicago have been in the news. Academia will have to respond. A great chorus of formal condemnation shall be lifted up, and my male colleagues will sputter with gall, appalled by the actions of bad apples so rare they have been encountered by every single woman I know.Female scientists like me will be solicited for constructive solutions that dont involve anybody getting fired. Female students will be advised to examine how their own behavior might have contributed, and I will have more than my usual trouble keeping my mouth shut. Human resources offices will issue statements reminding employees that we do not tolerate such behavior. These statements will be filed within cabinets already stuffed to bursting with reports of jokes that werent funny, of grabbing that wasnt an accident, of infatuations unwelcome and unwanted. And in the end, science  an institution terminally invested in believing itself honorable  will sort of come close to admitting that it isnt.ITS not something I can put on my C.V., but I believe that one of my most important duties is to walk young women through emails like the one my former student received, and I am called upon to do it many times each year. I emphasize to them that the first email is important because it is the one that the powers that be will point to and say, Why didnt you do something when you first got this? I talk to each woman bluntly and advise her to write back immediately, telling (not asking) him to stop.I teach her to draw strong professional boundaries and then to enforce them, not because she should have to, but because nobody else will. I insist that she must document everything, because someday he will paint this as a two-way emotional exchange. I wearily advise her to stick it out in science, but only because I cannot promise that other fields arent worse. And I hope that this is enough to make him stop. But it never, never stops.My former student is still receiving late-night emails, notes and presents left on her desk, and her co-worker is still insisting that they should meet outside of the hectic hours of work. She doesnt feel that she can go to her personnel office; shes heard plenty of stories from the other women at her institution about how this happens all the time and how nobody ever does anything about it. She was the best student that I had during the year that we worked together. The last time she talked to me, she told me that she was thinking of quitting."}
{"text": "Like other authoritarian leaders, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey has made it a point to show his people whos boss. He has waged war on the Kurdish separatists, imprisoned critics, taken control of much of the media, cowed the military and convinced a preponderance of his people that he is indispensable.Tough talk, aggressive action and grandiose swagger are his hallmarks.But Mr. Erdogan does, it seem, have a vulnerability: a thin skin. He cannot abide criticism. The evidence is the nearly 2,000 cases that prosecutors have opened against Turks for insulting Mr. Erdogan since he was elected president 18 months ago.On the list of offenders are cartoonists, journalists, academics, even children. In a rather bizarre example of this trend, a Turkish man recently filed a criminal complaint against his wife for insulting Mr. Erdogan. It is the first known instance where someonehas been the subject of a complaintfor maligningthe president in the privacy of his or her own home, Reuters reported.Under Turkish law, insulting the president is a crime punishable by up to four years in jail but the law has been invoked only rarely  until now. I am unable to read the shameful insults made against our president. I start to blush, said Bekir Bozdag, the justice minister and a member of Mr. Erdogans AK Party, said on Wednesday when answering questions before Parliament.The idea that Mr. Erdogan is so delicate that he would be grievously wounded by any language is hard to believe, and really beside the point. He is a ruthless and intolerant ruler who has proven that he does not really believe in and cannot abide his countrys democratic system. Democracy requires that citizens are able to speak out when necessary against their leaders.Free expression, including criticism, is essential for a free people. This much we know: Mr. Erdogan never would have made it through the 2016 American election campaign."}
{"text": "On Thursday, we challenged Well readers to figure out the case of a 36-year-old man with a 20-year history of migrating joint pains along with other strange symptoms. Nearly 300 of you offered thoughtful suggestions of what he might have had. And one out of 10 of you were spot on.The correct diagnosis is:Ehlers Danlos syndromeThe first reader to correctly make this diagnosis was Bryley Williams, of New York City. She told me she knows nothing about medicine but found the answer on the Internet by investigating noninflammatory causes of joint pain and pneumothorax. All of the winners of this contest are extraordinary, but I think Ms. Williams may take the prize. She is 15 years old, a freshman in high school in New York City. Well done, Ms. Williams! Maybe you should consider a career in medicine once you graduate.The DiagnosisEhlers-Danlos syndrome, or EDS, is a group of inherited disorders that affect the bodys connective tissues  the skin, muscles, tendons and ligaments that hold us together. Since the 1990s, the disease has been divided into six main types, depending on which connective tissues are most affected. Based on the gene study done in this patient, he was given a diagnosis of the least severe and most common variety, which primarily causes hypermobility of the joints as well as skin that is easily damaged and scars badly.EDS was probably recognized as early as 400 B.C., when Hippocrates noted that the nomads and Scythians had lax joints and multiple scars. This disorder came to more modern medical attention in the 17th century when, at a medical presentation in Holland, a Spanish sailor by the name of George Albes exhibited his remarkable ability to stretch the skin on his chest out an arms length.The first complete description of the condition was given by a Russian physician, Dr. A. N. Chernogubov, at the end of the 19th century. He presented a 17-year-old boy who suffered from recurrent joint dislocations and easily stretched and fragile skin. The boy had many scars resulting from minor injuries, because these patients do not heal normally. Based on these observations, Dr. Chernogubov predicted that the clinical manifestations were caused by an abnormality of the connective tissues.That report did not come to the notice of Western Europe for many years. So while the disorder still carries Chernogubovs name in Russia, in most places it referred to as EDS, after the two physicians who first characterized the disorder in Paris decades later: Dr. Edvard Ehlers and Dr. Henri-Alexandre Danlos.How the Diagnosis Was MadeThe patient, a 36-year-old man with a 20-year history of migrating joint pain, had been to dozens of doctors  internists, orthopedic surgeons, rheumatologists. All had examined him and seen nothing. Indeed, his last rheumatologist kept saying that she wanted to believe that he had this much pain but that she couldnt find anything physical to cause it.One orthopedist had asked him if his skin was particularly stretchy or if he was very flexible  obviously thinking of a diagnosis like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but the patient said no. He didnt think he was particularly flexible or that his skin was unusually stretchy. Later, once he had the diagnosis, he showed one of his doctors how he could move his thumb, and the doctor told him that he was popping it in and out of joint. And the geneticist told him that his skin was stretchy enough to fit the diagnostic criteria. Still, it all seemed normal to him. Not extraordinary in any way.Still, after 20 years of searching, the patient was finally willing to accept that he was just more prone to getting these pains. And he began keeping a list of the types of exercises or activities that seemed most likely to trigger the episodes of joint pain. His wife was unwilling to give up. She continued to search the Internet for answers.Like Son, Like Father?The final clue came not from the mans doctor but from his sons. The boy, age 11, went to see his pediatrician, Dr. Renee Brand, for his annual physical exam. He was tall and slender, like his father. He had a colt-like awkwardness about him, with arms and legs that looked just a bit too long to be well managed. And he had a stooped posture, as if he spent too much time gazing into a smartphone he didnt even have. Could he sit up completely straight? Dr. Brand asked. He couldnt, though he tried.Later the doctor asked him to bend over so that she could check his spine for scoliosis. He immediately flopped down, his chest almost touching his knees and his hands lying flat on the floor in front of him. Dr. Brand was surprised by this remarkable degree of flexibility. When the boy righted himself, she asked him to straighten his legs as far as they would go. When he did, his knees went well past straight, so that his legs bowed backward. Straightening his elbows produced a similar curve.I think maybe you should take him to see an orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Brand suggested to the boys mother. Two weeks later the mom called Dr. Brand with a report. Shed taken the boy to see the surgeo,n and he had in turn recommended that she take him to see a geneticist.I thought so, replied Dr. Brand with satisfaction. Seeing how remarkably flexible the young man was, and how hard it was for him to stand up straight, Dr. Brand thought the boy might have a disorder known as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.Getting a DiagnosisAfter making the appointment with the geneticist, the boys mother sat down at the computer to read up on Ehlers-Danlos. As she read through the descriptions, she could definitely recognize her son. But in those pages she also recognized her husband. Joint pain, check; pneumothorax, check; osteoporosis, check; scoliosis, check. Ultimately this inherited disease was diagnosed in both father and son.Theres no cure for EDS, but its important to know that you have it. The son sees a cardiologist every couple of years, since EDS can lead to problems with heart valves and vessels. He was found to be at risk for a dangerous stretching of his aorta that, without repair, could lead to rupture. And both father and son now understand which exercises are going to be a problem for them  possibly causing joint dislocations or other musculoskeletal injuries.Not Just CrazyFor the father, our patient, its meant a sacrifice that may sound trivial, but meant a lot to him: Hes had to give up running, his favorite form of exercise. The pounding is just too hard on his joints.I kept hoping that I could find a kind of physical therapy that would help me run the way I used to. Now I know I just cant, he said. Still, its a relief to be able to give a name to his mysterious problems. Its proof that Im not just crazy."}

{"text": "In the final quarter of Cemetery of Splendour, the latest feature from the Thai filmmaker Apichatpong Weerasethakul, theres an unusual exchange among the three main characters.Have you ever seen pink stone before? asks Keng (Jarinpattra Rueangram), a young psychic.This is the first time in my life, replies Jen (Jenjira Pongpas Widner), a volunteer assistant nurse and physical therapist.The exchange is unusual because the corresponding imagery contains no pink stone: The shot is of a forest floor, covered in dead leaves and a few stones; the womens feet are in the top edge of the frame. Then theres the matter of the exchange being among three of the characters, even though only two performers are in the frame and speaking to each other. This is because Keng is channeling Itt (Banlop Lomnoi), a soldier who has a mysterious sleeping sickness. Itt, it seems, can travel in his sleep from the world of the present to the world of the past. And this forest, near the makeshift hospital where Keng and Jen work, and where Itt is a patient, was once the site of a regal palace. Itt is able to see and describe the palace, because his ailment makes him a kind of prisoner there.Mr. Weerasethakul is probably the most quietly surprising director working today. Cemetery is a peaceful but troubled picture  theres a lot roiling beneath. Its muted, largely naturalistic color palette is a contrast from the highly saturated and lush tones of the last Weerasethakul picture to play in the United States, Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives, which won the Cannes Film Festivals Palme dOr in 2010.The colors and deliberate, assured editing rhythms of Cemetery imbue it with a distinctive quality. Shots range in duration between 10 seconds and several minutes; the viewer feels to be floating with the imagery, and when the cutting briefly quickens, a lulling, bobbing motion is simulated. The mood Mr. Weerasethakul conjures is all the more extraordinary when you consider that the movies premise, in the hands of almost any other director, would be used to build some kind of horror movie.Itt and a group of other soldiers lie immobile in a facility in Khon Kaen (the directors hometown, as it happens). Keng and Jen, among others, provide them with care, and early on they are all hooked up to some unusual machines (They used it with American soldiers in Afghanistan, the nurses are told) that help them dream good dreams. Each model has a standing tube that changes color, sometimes suffusing the ward with a cool blue or hot pink. Two goddesses  Jen prays to their statues  show up, as real people, and they tell Jen that the sleeping soldiers will never get better because the hospital sits on an ancient cemetery. The spirits of dead kings still at war with one another inhabit the place, and they are sucking the spiritual energy from the soldiers.Even so, Itt, Jens charge, is sometimes able to snap out of his stupor, and once awake and mobile, he has sharpened senses  I can tell the temperature of the lights, he says to Jen when they visit a plaza full of food stalls. Together, Jen and Itt explore the town. They go to the movies; we see them watching a trailer for a lurid horror film; then they stand up with the rest of the audience and stay still for a while. As it happens, its the custom in Thai movie theaters for audiences to stand for the national anthem; in the scene in Cemetery, though, no music plays.Theres a cultural specificity to this movie that will make it, for Western audiences, even more enigmatic than it is in its Thai context. This ought not be a stumbling block, though. Cemetery of Splendour, which is opening as part of a wide-ranging Weerasethakul retrospective that runs through Thursday at the IFC Center (also screening is the directors dreamy 2012 short feature Mekong Hotel), has an emotional pull thats terribly sad and that practically transcends its underpinnings in political allegory.Its final scene, in which the director moves his heretofore respectfully distant camera in for a couple of devastating medium close-ups, also features the most galvanic melding of pop music and cinematic imagery since the finale of Lynne Ramsays 2002 Morvern Callar. The mysterious universality that Mr. Weerasethakul achieves in this sequence, and in other moments throughout Cemetery of Splendour, is among the greatest of cinemas many glories.Cemetery of Splendour is not rated, is in Thai with English subtitles, and runs 2 hours 2 minutes."}

{"text": "Donald J. Trump said he would seek to broaden laws regarding the torture of terrorism suspects, a day after he said that as president he would be bound by laws and treaties that he would not order the military to violate.Mr. Trump has frequently struck an authoritarian note in his discussion of dealing with terrorism suspects, vowing, often with an expletive, to bomb the Islamic State, saying torture works, and promising to bring back waterboarding and introduce new methods that go a lot further.After facing criticism from former military leaders for making such comments, Mr. Trump issued a statement on Friday through a campaign aide that abruptly departed from those remarks and acknowledged the constraints of international law that a democracy like the United States must abide by.But at a rally in Orlando, Fla., during Super Saturday voting in four states, Mr. Trump again altered course.As far as the waterboarding is concerned, we have to stay within the laws, we have to stay within the laws, he said. But seconds later he asked the crowd whether it thought the Islamic State, who chops off heads, who drowns people in a cage, stays within the laws.Were like a bunch of babies  but were gonna stay within the laws, he added. But you know what were gonna do? Were gonna have those laws broadened. Because were playing with two sets of rules  their rules and our rules.He then repeated an apparently apocryphal story that he insisted has since been proven true, saying that  Gen. John J. Pershing, before executing Muslim prisoners in the Philippines about a century ago, dipped bullets in pigs blood. He first told the story shortly before the South Carolina primary.Mr. Trump insisted, For 28 years, there was no more terrorism. He added, Look it up!Mr. Trump also made the audience members raise their right hands and pledge that they would vote for him in the Florida primary, which is on March 15, though Mr. Trump said it would be on March 12. Remember, you all swore, Mr. Trump said after the hands went up. You cant change.Throughout the Orlando event, Mr. Trump was interrupted by protesters, something that appeared to irritate him the longer it went on.On Friday, Black Lives Matter demonstrators were among those who interrupted his rally in New Orleans. But on the same day, The Clarion Ledger of Jackson, Miss., reported that Charles Evers, the elderly brother of the slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, was backing Mr. Trump.Mr. Evers told the newspaper that he believed Mr. Trump would create jobs, and he dismissed complaints about Mr. Trump being a polarizing figure. I havent seen any proof of him being a racist, Mr. Evers said, adding, All of us have some racism in us. Even me."}

(editorial, Feb. 26):You are correct that the development of an effective H.I.V. prevention ring that can combine with contraception cannot proceed soon enough. Although a very welcome development, the dapivirine ring is not the only device with potential for birth control-H.I.V. prevention.Multipurpose Prevention Technologies, or M.P.T.s, are new methods in development that can deliver contraception with H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted disease prevention in various combinations. The dapivirine ring joins nearly a dozen potential M.P.T.s in early stage clinical trials.The promise of combined prevention has led funding agencies, researchers and advocates from around the world to form a product neutral, multidisciplinary collaboration called the Initiative for M.P.T.s to accelerate and advance development.Womens ability to avoid H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted diseases and determine pregnancy and child spacing brings undeniable social, economic and health benefits to women and families.

{"text": "Pat Conroy, who used his tortured family life and the scenic marshlands of coastal South Carolina as unending sources of inspiration for his fiction, notably the novels The Great Santini, The Lords of Discipline and The Prince of Tides, died on Friday. He was 70.His death was confirmed by Todd Doughty, the vice president, executive director of publicity at Doubleday. He said the cause of death was pancreatic cancer.Mr. Conroy had a brutal childhood. He was dominated by his sadistic father, Donald, a Marine Corps fighter pilot who beat his wife, drilled his seven children military-style to instill discipline and mercilessly abused his sons, first and foremost Pat, his eldest.His mother, the former Frances Dolores Peek, known as Peg, was a gauzy romantic who denied her impoverished background and read Gone With the Wind to Pat at bedtime, casting family members in the starring roles. She taught her children to lie about the physical punishment meted out by their father.Mr. Conroy mined the people, the places and the trauma of his childhood and young manhood for his thinly fictionalized novels and a series of memoirs that captivated readers with their openly emotional tone, lurid family stories and lush prose that often reached its most affecting, lyrical pitch when evoking the wetlands around Beaufort, S.C.To describe our growing up in the Lowcountry of South Carolina, his alter-ego narrator wrote in The Prince of Tides, I would have to take you to the marsh on a spring day, flush the great blue heron from its silent occupation. Scatter marsh hens as we sink to our knees in mud, open you an oyster with a pocketknife and feed it to you from the shell and say, There. That taste. Thats the taste of my childhood. I would say, Breathe deeply, and you would breathe and remember that smell for the rest of your life, the bold, fecund aroma of the tidal marsh, exquisite and sensual, the smell of the South in heat, a smell like new milk, semen and spilled wine, all perfumed with seawater.The miseries of his childhood and youth, and his troubled relationship with his father, supplied the material for The Great Santini, a modest commercial success that gained wider fame when it was made into a film in 1979 with Robert Duvall playing Lt. Col. Bull Meecham, a stand-in for Mr. Conroys father, and Blythe Danner as his wife.The Lords of Discipline, which drew heavily on Mr. Conroys years as a student at the Citadel, the military academy in Charleston, followed the same pattern: modest commercial success amplified by translation to the screen in 1983.With The Prince of Tides, Mr. Conroy hit the jackpot. His sprawling story of Tom Wingo, an unemployed high school teacher who confronts his past when he travels to New York to help his suicidal sister, sold more than 350,000 copies in hardcover and spent nearly a year on the best-seller lists. After Barbra Streisand directed and played a starring role in the film version, with Nick Nolte as the novels hero, Mr. Conroy moved to the front ranks of popular American writers.Some critics found him long-winded and purplish. Inflation is the order of the day, Richard Eder wrote of The Prince of Tides in The Los Angeles Times. The characters do too much, feel too much, suffer too much, eat too much, signify too much and above all talk too much.Mr. Conroys legion of admirers, however, hung on his every word, entranced by the naked emotionalism of his male characters, the Lowcountry atmosphere and the page-turning Southern yarns.If a reader has experienced a Conroy novel before, he knows the book will be flawed, he knows the book is 500-plus pages, and he knows the characters are, in many ways, the same ones he knew in the last Conroy novel, reads the entry on the writer in the reference work Contemporary Novelists. But in many ways, its like returning to old friends and familiar places, and the lyricism of the prose is more than most readers can resist.Donald Patrick Conroy was born on Oct. 26, 1945, in Atlanta. Because of his fathers career, the family moved constantly, and Pat attended 11 schools in 12 years before an assignment to the Marine Corps Air Station in Beaufort brought stability.Mr. Conroy embraced his new hometown with the grateful passion of a refugee. At Beaufort High School he earned a starting spot as point guard on the basketball team, while flourishing under the guidance of an English teacher who introduced him to the work of Thomas Wolfe and encouraged him to write.Pressured by his father, Mr. Conroy accepted a scholarship to the Citadel, where he earned a bachelors degree in English in 1967 and gathered the material for three books. The first was a collection of reminiscences about the schools assistant commander in charge of discipline, a colorful figure known as The Boo.Mr. Conroy wrote The Boo while teaching English at Beaufort High School and paid a vanity publisher to print 500 copies, borrowing the money from a bank. The Boo reappeared as The Bear in The Lords of Discipline, a twisty tale of loyalty, subterfuge, racial tension and cruelty centered on 10 undergraduates at the fictional Carolina Military Institute. (The third book to come out of the Citadel years was My Losing Season, a 2002 memoir about Mr. Conroys experience playing on the colleges basketball team.)After two years teaching at Beaufort High School, and having received no response to his application to join the Peace Corps, Mr. Conroy taught for a year at a two-room schoolhouse on Daufuskie Island, off the South Carolina coast near Hilton Head Island. His impoverished students, all of them black, spoke a local dialect, Gullah, and had almost no awareness of the world beyond their island. His unorthodox attempts to broaden their horizons caused the superintendent of schools to fire him after a year.Mr. Conroy set down his experiences in The Water Is Wide, a book he originally intended to self-publish but submitted to a New York agent, Julian Bach, at the urging of a friend.Mr. Bach called him with the good news that Houghton Mifflin had offered $7,500 for the book. Mr. Conroy, unfamiliar with the concept of a publishers advance, said that he could probably get the book printed more cheaply in Beaufort. Pat, you do understand, they pay you, Mr. Bach said.The book, published in 1972, was made into the 1974 film Conrack, with Jon Voight; it was the first of four Conroy novels to be turned into a movie. I write a straight story line, and I guess thats what they need, Mr. Conroy told Publishers Weekly in 1986. The dialogue also seems to be serviceable in a Hollywood way. But most important, I do the thing that Southerners do naturally  I tell stories.His reliance on his family history caused problems. Aunts and grandparents read his works, aghast, and begged him to stop. His sister Carol Ann, a poet, cut off relations with him after her battles with mental illness were dramatized in the figure of Savannah, the narrators sister in The Prince of Tides.When his mother was dying of leukemia, as he recounted to The Guardian of London in 1996, she told him, Son, I find it hard to relax when Im dying, knowing youre going to write down every damn word I say. On being told that she was included, in fictional form, in The Prince of Tides, she requested that Meryl Streep play the part. (It went to Kate Nelligan.)Donald Conroy, the father known to his children as Godzilla, was a special case. Initially enraged by his portrayal in The Great Santini, he came to relish the role. He bought Great Santini vanity plates for his car and often appeared alongside his son at book signings.He signed longer inscriptions than I would, Mr. Conroy told The Star Tribune in Minneapolis in 2013. Hed write, I hope you enjoy my sons work of fiction, and hed underline fiction five or six times, and sign it, Ol lovable, likable Donald Conroy.Literary fame did not win Mr. Conroy any points with his father. When asked by an Atlanta magazine to identify who read his sons books, the elder Mr. Conroy replied, Thats easy: psychiatrists, homosexuals, extreme liberals and women. Mr. Conroys father died in 1998. His mother died in 1984, having divorced Mr. Conroy several years earlier. At her divorce trial, she presented the judge with a copy of The Great Santini as evidence.After The Prince of Tides, Mr. Conroy labored for nearly a decade on his next novel, Beach Music, suffering a nervous breakdown  not his first  along the way.The suicide of his brother Tom in 1994 forced him to change the suicide of a similar character in Beach Music, about a travel writer in Rome who returns home to South Carolina to visit his mother on her deathbed. His last novel, South of Broad (2009), told the tale of high school friends in Charleston who reunite 20 years after their graduation in 1969.Mr. Conroy produced several works of nonfiction, including The Pat Conroy Cookbook: Recipes and Stories of My Life (1999), My Reading Life (2010) and The Death of Santini: The Story of a Father and His Son (2013). At his death, he was at work on both a novel and a memoir about living in Atlanta in the 1970s.Mr. Conroys first two marriages ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the writer Cassandra King; four daughters: Jessica Conroy, Melissa Conroy, Megan Conroy and Susannah Ansley Conroy; five stepchildren: Emily Conroy; Jake, James and Jason Ray; and Gregory Fleischer; two sisters, Kathy and Carol Ann; three brothers, Jim, Tim and Mike; and seven grandchildren.One of the greatest gifts you can get as a writer is to be born into an unhappy family, Mr. Conroy told the writer John Berendt for a Vanity Fair profile in 1995. I could not have been born into a better one. He added: I dont have to look very far for melodrama. Its all right there."}
{"text": "HONG KONG  Its all right to cry, even when youre the leader of the worlds most populous nation.That was one message in an online report on Wednesday carried by several Communist Party and state media outlets that described a handful of known times when President Xi Jinping of China had shed tears.The story didnt portray Mr. Xi as weepy  with just four documented cries since the 1960s, hes no John Boehner, the former House speaker. Rather it sought to show him as someone who feels deeply about family, friends, average citizens and model officials.It appears to be part of a broad effort to humanize Mr. Xi and build a cult of personality around him, an endeavor that has gone beyond anything dedicated to recent Chinese leaders. State and Communist Party news outlets as well as Chinese social media have carried cartoons, songs and photos of the daily life of Xi Dada, a nickname for the Chinese leader that means Daddy or Uncle Xi.A video of a new song that holds up Mr. Xi as the ideal sort of man a woman should marry has been widely viewed on Chinese websites in recent weeks. It is the sort of praise that would be unimaginable for his predecessor, Hu Jintao.Last month, Mr. Xi visited some of the countrys biggest news outlets and delivered a message about the partys dominance over the media. His words were reinforced days later when three editors were apparently punished at a newspaper that juxtaposed a headline outlining Mr. Xis message to the media with another about a funeral, possibly as a lament over the demise of aggressive news outlets in China.The story about Mr. Xis crying was first carried by a public WeChat account dedicated to reporting on the president. According to state media reports, the WeChat account is run by a group of journalists from the overseas edition of Peoples Daily, the partys flagship newspaper. The article was picked up by the website of CCTV, the state broadcaster. Then it was widely republished by other Chinese news outlets including Xinhua, the state news agency, an indication that it has high-level approval from the propaganda authorities.The piece includes an interview with Mr. Xi in 2004, when he was party secretary of Zhejiang Province, in which he lists two of the times he has cried. Once was after the death of an elder sister. He doesnt detail the circumstances, but she is believed to have killed herself because of persecution by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.The other incident Mr. Xi relates was in 1975, during his time in rural Shaanxi Province. He had been sent there in 1969 as part of the send down movement, in which urban youth were ordered to go to the countryside to learn from farmers. Many presumably cried when they arrived. Mr. Xi himself has spoken of the difficulties he experienced adjusting to hard farm labor and incessant flea bites.But the tears Mr. Xi describes were not attributed to hardship. Rather, he says they were the result of his sadness at leaving the people who had taken him in and welcomed him. At that time Mr. Xis father, Xi Zhongxun, had been purged of his leadership positions and his family was under attack.He tells of the party the locals held for him on his departure, killing a sheep to eat and giving him a notebook filled with good wishes. The next morning, as everyone gathered to wish him goodbye, he cried.I went away, but I left my heart there, he said.An earlier incident, which Mr. Xi spoke of during an event two years ago, involved his time as a student in February 1966, months before the official start of the Cultural Revolution, when a teacher read an article from Peoples Daily. The article described Jiao Yulu, a model official of that era, who tirelessly worked alongside the poor farmers in his county. The middle-school teacher began to cry as he read the article, as did the students in Mr. Xis class. In 1990, Mr. Xi wrote a poem in memory of Mr. Jiao that describes the struggle of being an upright official.A final round of tears was shed over a close friend, Jia Dashan, a writer who was Mr. Xis friend when he was an official in Hebei Province in the early 1980s. The two men often had long talks, and both cried when Mr. Xi left to take up a position in Fujian Province in 1985. Mr. Xi stayed close with Mr. Jia and wrote a long eulogy after his death in 1997. Guangming Daily, a party-run national newspaper, reprinted the eulogy in 2014, with an accompanying article that said the tribute showed Mr. Xis sincere friendship and personal charisma."}
{"text": "S-HERTOGENBOSCH, the Netherlands  Hieronymus Bosch died 500 years ago, his soul dispatched to parts unknown  perhaps oblivion, perhaps heavenly peace, perhaps a hellscape of his own invention. His reputation, however, resides in earthly paradise, with two blockbuster exhibitions this year, drawing tens of thousands to admire his slavering, fluttering, waddling abominations.Only about 25 Bosch paintings and a score of drawings survive, scattered through collections around the world. That means both exhibitions were acts of extraordinary organization, particularly for this charming little Dutch city, where Bosch lived, worked and died, but where none of his art remained. To obtain loans, the citys Noordbrabants Museum  lacking grand works to offer in return  pledged to research and restore others holdings. With this, it obtained 17 Bosch paintings and 19 of his drawings until its exhibition, Hieronymus Bosch  Visions of Genius, ends May 8. Weeks later, the Prado in Madrid will begin its own Bosch celebration, including his other masterpieces, not least one of the triumphs of Western art, his captivatingly bizarre Garden of Earthly Delights.The demonic visions of Bosch summon terrors of damnation from a half-millennium ago, but they also stir contemplation about what hell means today and how Bosch helped shape that view.For contemporary viewers, Bosch imagery can convey a flavor of farce  for example, the bird-headed monster wearing a cooking pot as a helmet while devouring a man whose backside emits fire, smoke and a flock of blackbirds. Kooky as that appears now, the painter himself found little to smirk at.Larry Silver, a professor of art history at the University of Pennsylvania, said Bosch held a despondent view of humanity, believing evil was embedded in us all. Bosch represents an implacable, inexorable divine justice  sublime retribution that will punish each and every crime, he wrote in an essay for the forthcoming Prado exhibition catalog.Little is known of Bosch, not even his birth year, estimated as 1450. Art was the family business: His father was a painter, as were his grandfather and most of his uncles and brothers. From this brood, one stood out, Jeroen van Aken, who brashly signed his paintings (unusual at the time) and incorporated the name of his town: Jheronimus Bosch.His era was one of great tension, as the values of late medieval life receded, and those of the early Renaissance advanced. Strikingly, Boschs life span (circa 1450-1516) nearly matches that of Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519). While Leonardo was sketching flying machines, Bosch sketched a spiked paddle wheel to impale the damned and carry them into the mouth of a ravening monster.A lot of the imagery that we think of as being almost historic imagery of hell, a great deal of that comes out of the period of Hieronymus Bosch, said Martin Palmer, a historian of world faiths who leads the Alliance of Religions and Conservation. Youve got the rediscovery of Classical knowledge, youve got people drifting away, youve got Erasmus with his radical teachings, youve got Luther  the whole world is going to hell in a handbasket. Catholics saw the threat of damnation as a way to suppress Protestantism, and vice versa, he said. Hell becomes useful when you feel you are losing control over your people.Bosch took existing medieval imagery  nude men and women speared by demons, flung into flames, cooked alive, eaten by Satan himself  and went further. Previous paintings of the Last Judgment, such as those by Giotto, Fra Angelico, and Rogier van der Weyden, were symmetrical, with paradise on one side, eternal damnation on the other. For Bosch, the heaven option scarcely appeared.His works are clogged with human villainy and ungodly fiends  even pastoral backgrounds include blips of horror: a distant gallows or one beast devouring another. He grafts butterfly wings onto rat-faced humanoids; he imagines a toothy fish with human legs (in stylish leather boots) feasting on a human. Sinners are impaled on trees; another is chopped into pieces and fried in a pan; some undergo uglier fates.Artistic depictions of the inferno have often evoked Dante, who inspired Botticellis map of hell, as well as Gustave Dors classic illustrations and Rodins Gates of Hell. Bosch set off a century of demonic knockoffs, the greatest by Bruegel. Later, Boschs influence seeped into haunting images by Goya, surrealist art and contemporary works by the Chapman Brothers.But today the Bosch viewpoint is so far from ours that the pictures can be bewildering. In 1953, the art historian Erwin Panofsky, who gained renown for finding symbolic meanings in paintings, confessed himself outfoxed: I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed.Complicating matters, experts debate which works are truly by Boschs hand. Such disputes erupted into public recently, after the Dutch exhibitions multiyear Bosch Research and Conservation Project concluded that two artworks to be lent by the Prado were not by the master. Enraged, the Madrid museum rescinded its offer of those pieces, calling the Dutch organizers unprofessional. The Prado also implies that its show, from May 31 to Sept. 11, will be superior, describing it as a unique and unrepeatable event and the most complete survey to date.Certainly, the Prado holds the finest Bosch works in any single collection and benefits from its status as a behemoth on the international art scene. The National Gallery in London chose to lend its Christ Mocked (The Crowning With Thorns) only to the Spanish museum. As the work is on panel, unfortunately for conservation reasons it is not able to travel very often so difficult decisions inevitably have to be made, the gallery said in a statement.The Dutch, despite missing out on some Bosch masterworks, are justifiably proud of their achievement. For years, the Noordbrabants Museum director, Charles de Mooij, trekked around Europe and the United States, negotiating loans from the Metropolitan Museum, the Louvre, the Gallerie dellAccademia in Venice, and many others. Emblematic of his efforts are four fragments of a triptych that was sawed apart in the 19th century, spread among galleries on opposite sides of the Atlantic and now reunited in the town of their creation.The most attention-grabbing work, however, is The Haywain  a triptych of noblemen and scoundrels led obliviously to hell  that the Prado allowed to remain in the Dutch exhibition. Equally thrilling are the drawings, like Infernal Landscape, offering glimpses at Boschs moment of creation, when pen and ink swirled into wondrous oddities.Never before has an art show in the Netherlands sold as many advanced tickets, the organizers say, with more than 200,000 by the latest count in a city of 140,000 people. On a recent visit, crowds converged around each nasty little Bosch beast, attesting to the enduring fascination of devils. Outside the museum, Boschmania flourished, with banners in the streets, images from the paintings on shop windows and monster souvenirs all around.The diabolical visions of Bosch remain beguiling and more popular than ever. Few may tremble anymore at his warnings against the wrath of God, but many will goggle at the imaginings of a most singular man."}

Trump flouted a rule set by Fox News during Thursday nights debate by conversing with his campaign manager during a commercial break, according to two rival campaign officials.The conversation was first reported by CNN.Mr. Trump apparently met with his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, during the first commercial break on the debate stage, violating the networks rule about candidates speaking with their staff members in the middle of the debate. Seeing the violation, Fox News let Mr. Trumps opponents meet with one of their staff members during subsequent breaks.Mr. Trumps conversation with his manager was a clear violation of the ground rules set by the network, but as the debates have gotten more and more heated, a lot of the rules have fallen by the wayside.

{"text": "TOKYO   Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and the leader of the southern island Okinawa agreed on Friday to take a dispute over the future of a United States military base out of the courts and back to the negotiating table.Mr. Abe accepted a freeze on construction work at a contentious new location planned for the base, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, as part of the agreement with Okinawas governor, Takeshi Onaga. Work had already been disrupted while the authorities in Tokyo and Okinawa fought a legal battle over the site.The deal is the latest twist in a 20-year effort by Japanese and American officials to move the base, which is in the middle of a crowded Okinawan city. National officials want to move the base to a less crowded part of the island, but Mr. Onaga and a majority of Okinawans oppose the plan because they want the Marines moved off Okinawa altogether.If the present situation continues, and we keep up an endless battle in the courts, things will simply become deadlocked, Mr. Abe said. Television footage showed Mr. Abe and Mr. Onaga shaking hands over the deal at the prime ministers office in Tokyo.Tokyo and Washington decided on the relocation in the 1990s, but opposition in Okinawa has stopped the plan from being carried out. The small island hosts about half of the roughly 50,000 American military personnel stationed in Japan, and many residents want the number reduced, not simply redistributed. Environmentalists have also criticized the relocation plan, which calls for a pair of runways to be built in what is now a coral-filled bay.Mr. Abe pushed harder than his predecessors to move the project forward.Driven by concerns over the growing military power of China, Mr. Abe has sought to deepen military ties with the United States  already a close ally and protector  and to bolster Japans defense in other ways. He has lifted restrictions on arms exports and reinterpreted the pacifist Constitution to allow Japanese forces to undertake combat missions overseas. The latter move has been especially controversial in a country that has not sent soldiers into battle since World War II, and where antiwar sentiment remains strong.The deal agreed to on Friday obliges Tokyo and Okinawa to drop overlapping lawsuits over the base and return to negotiations, but it sets no timetable. Japanese and American officials had hoped to move Futenma to its new location on Henoko Bay by 2023, but legal and political wrangling in Japan had already made that deadline untenable.Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the head of the United States Pacific Command, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month that the move would be delayed by at least two years, to 2025 or later.Mr. Abe and Mr. Onaga said they had not moved from their fundamental positions on Futenma. Relocating to Henoko is still the only option, Mr. Abe said. Mr. Onaga said he retained a conviction not to allow a new base to be built at Henoko.Mr. Abe and Mr. Onaga came to terms in response to a recommendation by a Japanese court. Last year, Mr. Onaga revoked a permit for survey and construction work on the new location, but the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism overruled his decision. Both sides sued over jurisdiction, and some legal experts thought the case would end up before the Supreme Court. But in January, in a decision in which the details were sealed until Friday, a lower court in Fukuoka proposed renewed negotiations instead.As part of the agreement on Friday, Mr. Abe and Mr. Onaga said that if new talks failed and the matter ultimately ended up in court again, they would accept whatever ruling a judge handed down.Hiroshi Ashitomi, a leader of a protest group in the city of Nago, where Henoko is, said he was cautiously optimistic about the result.I welcome the decision to suspend construction, but we dont know what the result of the negotiations will be, he said in a telephone interview. We believe in the governor.Opponents of the relocation have been let down before. Mr. Onagas predecessor, Hirokazu Nakaima, was elected on a promise to stop the project but ended up switching sides and issuing the permit needed for it to move ahead. Mr. Ashitomi said his group would continue sit-in protests in front of the Henoko site.Masaaki Gabe, a law professor at University of the Ryukyus, said Okinawas position in the lawsuits had looked marginally stronger than the governments. But by agreeing to go back to the negotiating table in return for the construction freeze, he said, Mr. Onaga would be able to stop on-the-ground work that might have made the relocation project irreversible in practice.Its basically a tie, he said. It sets things back to where they were before the dispute over the permit.Hiroshi Meguro, a research fellow at the Institute of Okinawan Studies at Hosei University in Tokyo, said Mr. Onaga may have been worried that the broad anti-base coalition he leads, which includes disgruntled members of Mr. Abes conservative governing party as well as communists and socialists, would crack before a final court decision was reached.And Mr. Abe, for his part, may have been concerned about the effect of the court battle on elections for the upper house of Parliament due this summer, Mr. Meguro said.The court basically told them, go back and talk more, he said. Both sides had reason to follow its advice."}
{"text": "With anxiety about the economy bubbling up on Wall Street and at campaign rallies around the country, the government reported on Friday that employers added 242,000 workers in February, a hefty increase that highlighted the labor markets steady gains.Weve got a real strong job market going, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. It does suggest that fears about a U.S. recession have been greatly overdone.Four years ago, at this point in the last presidential election cycle, the jobless rate was 8.3 percent and the economic recovery was in a relatively early stage. Then, worries centered on rising gas prices, deep consumer debt and government layoffs.Now, the recovery is in its seventh year, the unemployment rate has dropped sharply to 4.9 percent and the private sector has chalked up 72 months of uninterrupted job gains, the longest streak on record. Oil prices may still be causing ulcers, but this time it is primarily producers who are feeling the pain, because prices have plunged.The shadow on the otherwise positive Labor Department report was that wages fell 0.1 percent in February, a disappointment after Januarys  promising 0.5 percent increase. That put the yearly growth in wages at 2.2 percent, only modestly ahead of the inflation rate. The average length of the workweek declined by 0.2 hours last month.Despite the setback on wages, Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at Standard & Poors, was upbeat about the economys prospects this year. Were back in the saddle again, she said, noting that the heavy snowfall that hit the Northeast last month apparently did little to curtail hiring in retail sales and food services.Given the slowdown in China and a herky-jerky stock market, Wall Street has been betting that the Federal Reserve will put off any interest rate increase at its next meeting later this month. William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, expressed caution this week, saying: I have marked down my growth outlook very modestly.Economists said the Fed was still likely to remain in a holding pattern, but the strong jobs report would at least give its policy makers plenty to talk about and increased the chances that it would decide to raise borrowing costs in April or June. As Mr. Tannenbaum put it: This number will certainly spice up the Feds discussion.A broader measure that includes people too discouraged to search for work or who are making do with a part-time job because they cannot find a full-time one fell 0.2 of a percentage point, to 9.7 percent.Perhaps the most encouraging sign in the monthly statistics was evidence that people who had long been sidelined were being lured back to the job market. The overall share of Americans in the labor force ticked up 0.2 of a percentage point to 62.9 percent.That has been the shadow hanging over all the other labor force statistics, Patrick OKeefe, director of economic policy at CohnReznick, an accounting, tax and advisory firm, said of the stubbornly low participation rate.Despite the improved economic picture, there is still plenty of distress and anger, emotions that have helped spur the success of the Republican presidential front-runner, Donald J. Trump, and rallied many Democrats behind the underdog Bernie Sanderss attacks on inequality and Wall Street cronyism.Part of the reason is the unevenness of the recovery. Fortunes have diverged depending on where people live, their education and skill levels and what industry they work in.We are seeing job growth across a range of industries, but were also seeing a polarization in the labor market, said Tara Sinclair, chief economist for the job site Indeed.There has been vigorous demand for hospitality and service workers, often at low wages. But the higher total job count masks losses in manufacturing, transportation, warehousing and energy, better-paying industries that tend to be dominated by blue-collar white men who have been particularly battered by shifts in the American economy.The mining industry, for example, continues to bleed jobs, with a loss of 19,000 in February, while manufacturing lost 16,000.Working people in states like Michigan and Ohio feel the lousy manufacturing job loss and growing trade deficit with China, even if Wall Street and D.C. do not, Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, said in a statement. If youre wondering why theres so much interest in political insurgencies among both Democrats and Republicans this year, heres your answer.And while employment has been advancing at a robust pace for more than two years, many workers continue to complain about low pay, or jobs beneath their skill levels.Why do we have this persistent gloom about the economy, when you have below-average unemployment rates? asked Neera Tanden, president of the left-leaning Center for American Progress. It is really a product of anxiety about what we call the middle-class squeeze, the ability of your income and wages to keep up with the staples of a middle-class life.If you look at many Trump voters, they generally are people who have not been winning economically for a long time as the country is diversifying, Ms. Tanden said. Whites without a college education provide the core of support for Mr. Trump.Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director and now president of the American Action Forum, a center-right policy research organization, agreed that stalled incomes were a persistent source of dissatisfaction. Getting wage growth up more rapidly is the key thing, he said.Still, if steady job growth continues and wages pick up in response to a tighter labor market, it could change views about the economy and influence the political dynamic. In previous elections, the direction of the economy in the months leading up to the vote has been perhaps the single most important factor affecting whether Americans opt for continuity or change.The brisk hiring since the Affordable Care Act went into effect also serves to undermine the Republican argument that the measure has stripped millions of jobs from the economy.Our businesses have created jobs every single month since I signed that job killing Obamacare bill, for a total of 14.3 million private sector jobs, President Obama told reporters at the White House.Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor, underscored the point. Theres an undeniable Eeyore caucus out there of fear-mongers and fact-deniers who want people to believe there is no job creation, he said.Certainly, the law is spurring job creation in the health care industry, with 38,000 jobs added in February.Edward Fleischman, chief executive of the Execu/Search Group, a professional recruiting firm based in New York, said he had seen outsize demand for health care professionals, including urgent care physicians, nurses, therapists and technicians. A lot of that has to do with Obamacare, he said.Mr. Fleischman, whose firm opened three new offices last year, added that hiring  particularly for digitally adept workers  had been strong across the board.Fridays report is the first of three estimates of Februarys job creation by the Labor Department. Revisions for December and January showed a total of 30,000 more jobs than previously reported.William Spriggs, chief economist at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., contrasted the palpable dissatisfaction of many voters with the record of unbroken job creation. This is one of those times when the economic cycle has hit a weird political cycle, he said."}
{"text": "PARIS  It was sheer coincidence that Rick Owens, an American in Paris, staged his Mastodon show, named for an extinct species, the same night as the Republican debate in Detroit, where Senators Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz were characterized by this newspaper as fighting for their political lives. It was a fluke of timing that Mr. Owens subtitled the show after a Salvador Dal painting (Swans Reflecting Elephants) at a moment when most observers, including those at the side of the runway, feel they are living through a surreal time. And it was just happenstance that he was looking at embracing the inevitable end of a cycle just as issues of the decline of the republic were on everyones minds.Really: This isnt sarcasm. It wasnt planned that way.Mr. Owens had been, he said, thinking not about politics but about the destruction of the environment, a concern since his mens show earlier in the year, and this was a kinder, gentler continuation of that train of design. But just because it started in one place does not negate its eerie resonance in another. Some things just happen that way.It was impossible to see the gracefully draped cream tunics, cowls creating their own topography, the elephantine trousers, mudslide leather boleros and boiling sea-foam capes, however, and not feel a potent nostalgia for a world gone by: Natural or political just depends on your point of view. Either way, the clothes touched a nerve.Lava-like rivulets melted down a tailored earthen coat, a brown puffa jacket turned up in a dinosaurs tail at the end, and fuzzy mohair in cloudy shades enveloped the body like so much primordial comfort dressing.We could all use a bit of that right about now. About halfway through the Lanvin show  the brands first since it split with its former long-term creative director, Alber Elbaz, the designer who had crafted its contemporary identity  a pall had settled over the room.Though it was taking place in a new venue, the better to suggest a fresh start, and though the show notes used words like love and liberty and euphoria to describe the peplum silk tops with puffed sleeves, the metallic high-necked lace dresses and gold trench designed by the creative studio, the collection resembled nothing so much as an amalgam of various looks we have seen before on other runways.The man/woman thing  it was in there. The big-shouldered 80s Dynasty thing  in there. The lingerie Madonna moment  in there. There was little about the result that appeared either unique or deeply considered, two qualities that had always been associated with Lanvin (at least in its modern incarnation). Maybe thats inevitable, when a company is without creative leadership, but it only serves to underscore the absence of a guiding aesthetic mind. Which raises the question: When in-between eras, why force the issue?At least at Christian Dior, the other brand currently with an artistic director opening, there was more fluency with pre-existing elements, though its update in the hands of the studio heads Lucie Meier and Serge Ruffieux, the creative caretakers of the brand, was less than focused.Short, curvy portrait-collared cashmere or fur coats had a jolie madame cool, and cocktail dresses with hip-hugging skirts and high waists under colorful silks sliding off one shoulder, a fillip of chic. But the new Bar suit, the jacket purposefully oversize and sporting some extra frou on one hip, the skirt below-the-knee with an inexplicable fold on a thigh, were frumpy.Neither had the clarity of Loewe, where  in his best show yet as creative director  Jonathan Anderson climbed out of the leather goods rabbit hole and left his own uninhibited, experimental instincts at home (though they often plant new ideas in fashions head, they can tilt to the unwearable extreme: Remember the clear plastic pants of last season?). The result was a new voice for the brand.It had to do with a fluid hourglass silhouette constructed from long-sleeved, handkerchief-hemmed, organic bamboo jersey dresses; or cotton shirting caught at the waist by a leather breastplate or a shirred nylon overlay, echoed at the elbow; and a Klimtian palette of cream, black and gold. And it had to do with elongated tweed knits lavishly fringed on the bias and hem, complete with matching bags (plus cat-faced nappa medallions hung around the neck) and evening wear dangling sleeves of looped metallic chains.These were clothes that knew what they were about  an easy, intelligent elegance. As does Vetements, the in-your-face upstart collective whose iconoclastic, all-inclusive approach to sartorial sacred cows, gender fluidity and street style has propelled its co-founder, Demna Gvasalia, to the hot seat at Balenciaga (he makes his debut on Sunday).In the state flag-festooned environs of the American Cathedral in Paris, parochial-school pleated skirts and dresses were shrunken to infant proportions and then squeezed onto grown women; neckties roped and left to trail, noose-like, at the back; shoulders on shirts and jackets blown out to Frankenstein size or pinched up and in, to create a Quasimodo effect; and sweatshirts and sweatgowns emblazoned with slogans: sexual fantasies and unskinny and May the bridge I burn light the way, among them. The latter being particularly apropos.Theyll probably sell out, as will the thigh-high leather wader boots tattooed with guns and roses and the jailhouse legends love and hate above each knee; ditto, the velvet trouser suits, sneaked in amid the mayhem.Theres a fashion constituency that wants nothing more than disrupting the status quo (sound familiar?) and Vetements has found it, positioning itself as the ultimate outsider. Though now that it has Kanye in the audience and Kering on speed dial, its unclear how much longer it can keep up the pretend distance.ChalayanAs it happens, Hussein Chalayan was also thinking globally in his collection. Specifically, he was thinking about Germany, which got him thinking about Teutonic culture in general, which led him off on tangents having to do with the Brothers Grimm, the autobahn, the space shuttle and other kinds of technology, and a magazine called Burda, whose how-to section he loved. Such is the designer mind, which then spins it all together in a centrifuge only to spit it back out, transformed.In this case, into elegant black wool coats cut on the curve at the waist, cool tweed trouser suits, and navy duffle coats that morphed into sapphire fur shawls, which then took off into cherry red jersey jumpsuits and evening caftans embroidered in crystal dashboard geometries. Also white silk bias-cut gowns printed in decontextualized sewing patterns; jackets adorned with countdowns picked out in crystals; and metallic coveralls made to look like highway signs, pointing to fairy tale destinations.The latter series was a little literal in execution. But then, who doesnt wish for a happy ending?"}

He was 86.His death was announced by his wife, the photographer Anita Ruthling Klaussen, on her Facebook page.Mr. Collins had largely been away from tennis since tearing tendons in his left leg in a fall at his hotel room while attending the 2011 United States Open in New York. The injury required many surgical procedures.But last September, accompanied by Ms. Klaussen, he attended a ceremony at the Open in which the new media center was named in his honor. A plaque for him reads, Journalist, Commentator, Historian, Mentor, Friend.Either the ball goes over the net or it doesnt, Mr. Collins wrote in the opening sentence of Bud Collins Modern Encyclopedia of Tennis. Having stripped the sport to its essence, he nonetheless observed, For some degenerates, tennis is a way of life, even a religion.It was much that way with Mr. Collins, who popularized tennis for millions of Americans in its boom years after the emergence of the Open era in 1968, when professionals were finally allowed to compete for the major championships.Mr. Collins was a flamboyant part of the tennis scene. Balding and sometimes bearded, he could be spotted in a crowd by his wardrobe, one that favored bow ties and his custom-made signature slacks. Yellow, violet and burgundy were among his favorites, and strawberry embellishments were added for Wimbledon.Reporting on tennis for NBC, he was best known for Breakfast at Wimbledon, his play-by-play and commentary at the tournaments finals, broadcast live on weekend mornings.But Mr. Collins considered himself as much a print journalist as a TV personality. His first bylined article in The Boston Globe appeared in December 1963, when he covered Davis Cup play in Australia. His final article for the newspaper appeared in September 2011, when he was reporting on the United States Open. He was a writer and senior editor at World Tennis magazine. His encyclopedia, written with Zander Hollander and first published in 1980, went through several editions, and he followed it with The Bud Collins History of Tennis and Total Tennis.While he focused on tennis, he mused about anything that caught his eye in his travel column, Anywhere, and he covered combat in the Vietnam War.Mr. Collins was much the showman. He often quoted his imaginary Uncle Studleys reflections on tennis. Steffi Graf was Fraulein Forehand, Bjorn Borg was the Angelic Assassin and the hard-serving Venus and Serena Williams were Sisters Sledgehammer. He considered himself the representative of the everyday player, or the hacker, as he put it.Mr. Collins did the play-by-play for Breakfast at Wimbledon at its inception in 1979, after NBC had previously confined coverage to taped matches. In 1983, NBC shifted him to analysis and interviews when Dick Enberg was given the main broadcasting role.Buds enthusiasm when hes doing play-by-play can be a little overwhelming, Michael Weisman, the executive producer of NBC Sports, told Sports Illustrated in 1985. It goes back to my philosophy that less is more. Im a big fan of Buds, but I thought if he made only one reference to his uncle instead of six, it might play better.Mr. Collins was dropped by NBC in 2007 after 35 years with the network; afterward, he broadcast for ESPN and the Tennis Channel while continuing to write a column for The Globe.The guy is utterly unique, the sportswriter Frank Deford wrote on Sports Illustrateds website in the summer of 2007, expressing his dismay when NBC dropped Mr. Collins. There isnt another American journalist so identified with his sport as Bud is with tennis. He is the very soul of the game  as historian, as authority, as devotee, as enthusiast.He was a fine player, as well. Mr. Collins won the national indoor mixed doubles at Longwood Cricket Club in suburban Boston in 1961, teaming with Janet Hopps, and he reached the final of the French Open senior mens doubles in 1975, playing with Jack Crawford. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I., in 1994.His reverence for tennis did not extend to the bureaucracy that ruled it in the amateur era. Writing in Sports Illustrated in February 1968 as the Open era dawned, he described the United States National Lawn Tennis Association as an organization that, in terms of efficiency and coordination, rivals that of the New York Mets.Arthur Worth Collins Jr. was born on June 17, 1929, in Lima, Ohio, and grew up in Berea, where his father was the athletic director and a coach at Baldwin-Wallace College. As a youngster, Mr. Collins thrilled to radio broadcasts of the United States Nationals from Forest Hills, Queens.At age 18, he drove with two high school friends to Forest Hills for the 1947 Nationals  the forerunner of the United States Open  arriving there just as play was ending for that day.Sprinting up a steep concrete stairway, we burst through a portal and were stunned by a green flash, he wrote in his memoir, My Life With the Pros (1989). Two men in white were still playing to a congregation of perhaps two hundred. The minarets of the Forest Hills Inn and the groves of Forest Hills Gardens, the comfortable residential pocket in which the club nestles, stood confidently in the gloaming, sturdy defenders of the faith, gray against an azure evening. Forest Hills. It was indeed revelation to the weary, sticky pilgrims, a romantic encounter.Mr. Collins played tennis at Baldwin-Wallace and graduated in 1951. After Army service, he enrolled at Boston University, seeking a masters degree in public relations, but left to join The Boston Heralds sports staff.He covered tennis for the first time when his editor apologetically sent him to Longwood for an event when everyone else on the papers sports staff was shunning tennis, considered by many at the time as an outpost for elitist amateurs.Mr. Collins became The Heralds lead sports columnist in 1959. He also coached the Brandeis University tennis team, whose roster included Abbie Hoffman, destined for far greater notice in the counterculture movement of the 1960s.Mr. Collins moved to The Globe in 1963, when he also began broadcasting tournaments for WGBH, Bostons educational television outlet, which pioneered TV coverage of the sport.He covered the Nationals for NBC in 1964 and the United States Open for CBS from 1968 to 1972, then returned to NBC to cover Wimbledon and other major events.In May 2009, Boston University awarded him the masters degree in public relations he had never completed, citing his writings on the history of tennis as sufficiently scholarly.Besides his wife, Mr. Collins is survived by his stepchildren from that marriage, Danielle Klaussen and Karl Klaussen; a daughter, Suzanna Mathews, from his first marriage, to Palmer Collins, which ended in divorce; his stepchildren Betsy Bartelt, Kristin Hunt, Sharon McMillan and Gretchen West from his second marriage, to Mary Lou Barnum, who died in 1990; Rob Lacy, a son of Judy Lacy, a companion of Collinss and now deceased, whom he raised with her; and 11 grandchildren, The Globe reported.When the United States Tennis Association announced it would take the United States Open out of Forest Hills and move it to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Mr. Collins reflected on some of the great names and matches in remembering the setting that had entranced him on first blush while a teenager.Before smog, there was Forest Hills, he wrote in The New York Times in September 1977. Before short pants. Before Big Bill Tilden, who filled the house year after year, and finally came apart. Before Helen Wills, who beat Kitty McKane in the inaugural match in the stadium. He added, Before Jack Crawford, who fortified himself with gulps of brandy but was still unable to hold off Fred Perry in the 1933 final.But Mr. Collins shunned unvarnished sentimentality.The towers of an inn become shabby still look good at a distance, he wrote, and Forest Hills Gardens remains a pleasant residential enclave. But the effect is fleeting, probably because the floodlights have been turned on for night play, and the stadium floor is now down to the gritty, and drab clay courts have replaced most of the handsome lawns.There is really no way to recreate Forest Hills-as-it-was any more than you can recreate a first love."}

{"text": "Donald Trump did not amass a majority of delegates on Super Tuesday. But he could soon.If the people in the rest of the nation vote as the Super Tuesday results suggest they would, Mr. Trump would easily amass a majority of delegates and avoid the contested convention that his opponents hope to force and win.He could even do so without wins in Ohio and Florida, the two largest winner-take-all states, where he faces opponents in their home states.Mr. Trump would amass so many delegates because the rules become more biased toward candidates who win, allowing him the chance to take an overwhelming share of delegates with just a minority of the vote. It becomes easy to win lopsided delegate margins starting March 15, when states are allowed to apportion their delegates on a winner-take-all basis. At the same time, the primary calendar doesnt become less favorable and may even become more advantageous to him, depending on which candidates stay in the race.But the results so far also indicate he could still be defeated, suggesting Mr. Trump is far from winning a majority of the popular vote. He could be denied a majority of delegates if the field narrowed to Mr. Rubio.If the remaining states vote as one would expect based on their demographics and the results so far, Mr. Trump will defeat Marco Rubio by a margin of 37 percent to 25 percent over the rest of the race. Ted Cruz would take third place over the rest of the primary season, with 22 percent of the vote. (These figures were calculated by weighting the candidates projected vote share in congressional districts by Mitt Romneys vote in 2012, to more appropriately reflect the importance of caucuses. The actual popular vote would be worse for Mr. Cruz.)Mr. Trumps 12-point lead over Mr. Rubio would translate into a huge majority of the outstanding delegates. He would be favored to amass around two-thirds of the delegates that remain  or around 1,100 additional delegates on top of the more than 300 delegates he already holds. That would easily be enough for Mr. Trump to clear the 1,237 delegates needed to win.It would even be enough to withstand losses in both Ohio and Florida, two big winner-take-all states.Its important to emphasize that these estimates arent predictions. They assume the rest of the country will vote as it has so far, and the race could easily change. Perhaps Mr. Rubio will fade after his showing on Super Tuesday. Maybe an organized stop Trump effort will have an effect.But the estimates nonetheless make an important point: There wont be a contested convention if things keep going as they have been.Mr. Trump would fare well in the pure winner-take-all states as well as the states with a mix of winner-take-all by statewide vote and congressional district. Many of these states, like New York and New Jersey, are traditionally strong for establishment-backed candidates. But the results so far suggest Mr. Trump would have a significant advantage there, as he did in Massachusetts  his best state on Super Tuesday.Mr. Trump is vulnerable in some states and at a disadvantage in few. He trails in just Kansas, Hawaii, North Dakota, Utah, Wyoming, Nebraska, South Dakota and Idaho. Elsewhere, Mr. Trump holds a lead and often a commanding one.That doesnt mean that his rivals cant or wont deny a majority of delegates to Mr. Trump.It would be easier if Mr. Rubio, not Mr. Cruz, were the main rival to Mr. Trump. The model shows Mr. Rubio is on track to surpass Mr. Cruz in delegates by the end of the primary season, despite his struggles so far.That may seem surprising, since Mr. Rubio has won fewer states than Mr. Cruz. But the states about to vote are more moderate and plainly worse for Mr. Cruz than the states that have already voted.Mr. Cruz has nearly no chance to win the delegate-rich blue states later in the calendar. Hes not even on track to exceed 15 percent of the vote in several states where Mr. Trump would need to be slowed, while Mr. Rubio is in striking distance.Mr. Rubio would need to beat Mr. Trump in several big winner-take-all or winner-take-most states.In these projections, Mr. Trump amasses a huge 856-56 delegate lead over Mr. Rubio from the following 16 states: Arizona, Florida, Delaware, Indiana, Montana, New Jersey, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri, California, Maryland, New York, Wisconsin and Connecticut.That huge delegate edge might seem to imply that Mr. Trump is really winning big, but many of these contests are relatively close  Mr. Trump just benefits from the growing winner bias of the Republican delegate rules. Mr. Rubio would not need to make too many gains to deny Mr. Trump a majority.Mr. Trump would need to lose about 200 delegates from these states. Florida and Ohio, worth about 165 delegates, would cover much but not all of the distance. Realistically, though, stopping Mr. Trump at the convention might require holding him more comfortably beneath the 1,237 needed to win.What would that look like? Just add the Kasich vote to Mr. Rubios. Thats not quite how it would work in the real world  Mr. Rubio wouldnt win 100 percent of the Kasich vote if he dropped out  but its useful for illustrative purposes.Adding the Kasich vote gives Mr. Rubio additional wins in Wisconsin, Washington, New Mexico, California, South Dakota, Arizona, Oregon, Maine, Maryland and Nebraska. If you give Mr. Rubio and Mr. Kasich the same home-state advantage that helped Mr. Cruz win in Texas, then they win Ohio and Florida (although polls do not show Mr. Rubio with such an edge in Florida). It would cut deep into Mr. Trumps delegate edge in states like New York and Illinois.In the end, the Republican rules arent very complicated. If Trump can win by the margin he did on Super Tuesday, hes going to earn a majority of delegates no matter how many candidates remain in the race. If another candidate, most obviously Mr. Rubio, can start to fight him to a draw in the later states, then Mr. Trump could be denied a majority of delegates. The results so far suggest thats possible, since Mr. Trump is not close to the pace needed to win a majority of the popular vote.Whether Mr. Trump would lose the nomination if he entered the convention with a large plurality of delegates is a separate question. But a contested convention is nonetheless the best the traditional candidates can hope for."}
{"text": "Russell Turner was a part of not one but two teams that became the first in their programs histories to make an N.C.A.A. tournament. As a player, he was a freshman on the Hampden-Sydney team that made its first Division III tournament in 1989. Now, as the coach of U.C. Irvine, he hopes to lead the Anteaters to a second consecutive berth in the Division I tournament after last seasons team earned the first invitation in program history.For those five programs that are charter Division I members but have never participated in the tournament  Army, the Citadel, Northwestern, St. Francis of Brooklyn and William & Mary  Turner has some advice.Im sure that what we felt is what they feel, he said, which is that there are a lot of people in the community that worry it maybe cant happen, that theres something preventing it from happening. And theres not.Technically, four of the five still harbored N.C.A.A. dreams entering Fridays games, as every Division I conference except the Ivy League awards an automatic bid in its conference tournament. (St. Francis bowed out to Mount St. Marys on Wednesday night in the Northeast Conference quarterfinals.)But Turners advice may be most useful for William & Mary. The Tribe has lost in the finals of the Colonial Athletic Association tournament the past two years, and four times over all since 2008. Last years loss, to Northeastern, came as the top seed, and after a double-overtime victory over Hofstra the day before. In 2014, the Tribe lost to Delaware by a point.William & Mary (19-10, 11-7 C.A.A.) entered this seasons C.A.A. tournament seeded fifth, and it will play fourth-seeded James Madison on Saturday afternoon in the quarterfinals in Baltimore  exactly a week after losing at James Madison, 71-65, in the final game of the regular season.Itd be exciting, Tony Shaver, William & Marys coach, said of the prospect of finally getting into the N.C.A.A. tournament. Its not my ambition in life. I think its unfortunately become the most important thing in college basketball, but I judge our season successful in a lot of other factors.Shaver knows something about this: He was the coach of that drought-slaking Hampden-Sydney team.Shaver said that he had addressed William & Mary about its N.C.A.A. drought only once last year, before the C.A.A. tournament. And a couple of players acknowledged the history, but, echoing Turner, said that they saw it as an opportunity, not a weight.We talk about it a little bit amongst ourselves, the senior guard Terry Tarpey said, but not in the sense of, Oh, we havent made the tournament, but, Lets be those guys that finally get it done.He added: Its not a burden. We use it as motivation to go out there and play hard.Omar Prewitt, a sophomore guard, said the tournament was more a carrot that could be enjoyed upon success than a stick that might inflict pain upon failure.Thats been a dream for me growing up, he said of playing in the tournament, which several of his childhood friends and teammates have done with Kentucky and Louisville.Tarpey said that the near misses of recent years had energized William & Marys fan base. He pointed in particular to last seasons first Gold Rush Game, which was followed by another this season, in which the fans turned up wearing the teams primary color at a home game.We had a great turnout, Tarpey said. My freshman, sophomore years, there werent really any opportunities for that.The most conflicted spectator at the C.A.A. tournament, which began Friday in Baltimore, will undoubtedly be Tom Yeager. He has been the conferences commissioner for all 31 years of its existence, and he is stepping down in a few months.In a phone interview this week, he carefully balanced his required neutrality with William & Marys obvious appeal to the emotions.I think  without wishing anyone else ill  everybody in all of college sports would cheer an underdog, Yeager said.Youre rooting for both of them, a great game, he added. The side story is: Hey, William & Mary has never been there. But you dont start by giving them a 5-point lead."}
{"text": "As the Australians and the Americans continued their first-round Davis Cup match on grass at historic Kooyong Stadium in Melbourne, tennis officials confirmed Friday that the matches should have been played on a hardcourt surface.In a statement, the International Tennis Federation attributed the extraordinary situation to a three-way oversight by the I.T.F., the United States Tennis Association and Tennis Australia, which all acknowledge.The I.T.F. said the matter now would be examined by its Davis Cup Committee.We recognize that an oversight has taken place regarding the playing surface for the first-round Davis Cup match taking place in Kooyong, Australia, said Chris Widmaier, a spokesman for the U.S.T.A., in an email Friday. We look forward to working with the I.T.F. and Tennis Australia on how this oversight will be corrected the next time that the U.S. and Australia compete in Australia in the Davis Cup competition.One of the privileges and principal advantages of hosting a Davis Cup tie is the ability to select the surface, known as the choice of ground. But in 1999, the last time the Australians and Americans met in Davis Cup, the Americans were forced to surrender that right and play on a hardcourt.That was because of fallout from the I.T.F. decision to stage a celebration of the 100th anniversary of Davis Cup at Longwood Cricket Club in the Boston area in conjunction with the 1999 quarterfinal round. Normally, in Davis Cups alternating home-and-away format, Australia should have hosted the United States that year, but the centenary celebration disrupted the usual order.John Newcombe, Australias captain at that time, and some team members were unhappy, even briefly threatening a boycott, but they were eventually placated, with the I.T.F. ruling that the Americans, who wanted to play on clay, should play on a more neutral hardcourt instead.In exchange, the I.T.F. president, Brian Tobin; the Tennis Australia president, Geoff Pollard; and the U.S.T.A. president, Judy Levering, agreed that the next tie in Australia between the two countries would be played on a hardcourt as well.Few would have imagined it would take 17 years for the two traditional Davis Cup powers to meet again, and when the particulars of the 2016 match were announced, the 1999 agreement, which is official and part of a signed document, was apparently lost in the bureaucratic shuffle.Tennis Australia and its new Davis Cup captain, Lleyton Hewitt, chose grass, installing a temporary court in Kooyong Stadium. No one from the U.S.T.A. protested, not even its Davis Cup captain, Jim Courier, who played in that 1999 tie and had lobbied for clay that year.This is not the first bureaucratic bungle of late involving the U.S.T.A. and I.T.F. Last month, it was revealed that Croatian umpire Denis Pitner had been suspended from officiating in August 2015 by the I.T.F. after a corruption inquiry but still was able to work as a linesman at last years United States Open.A grass surface looked like a bigger advantage this year for Australia when Nick Kyrgios, a former Wimbledon quarterfinalist with a big game and serve, was in the lineup. But even after Kyrgioss late withdrawal, grass remains a strong surface for the Australians, whose four-man lineup includes Bernard Tomic, a former Wimbledon quarterfinalist himself, and Hewitt, a former Wimbledon champion who came out of retirement briefly to rejoin the Australian squad at age 35. It remains unclear if Hewitt will play at Kooyong.Tennis Australia could not immediately be reached for comment, but Barbara Travers, an I.T.F. spokeswoman, attributed some of the confusion on the choice of surface to an incomplete database that had not been updated properly after the 1999 agreement.I absolutely believe this wasnt gamesmanship; its just that nobody remembered, Travers said by telephone Friday.The Australians also will be the host for the next match between the United States and Australia in compensation for the Americans hosting two consecutive ties between the nations in 1997 and 1999.The most likely solution to the surface oversight is for the Davis Cup Committee to rule that the next tie between the Americans and Australians will be on a hardcourt. But that remains to be confirmed.While neither nation remembered the condition attached to this tie, now that it has been brought to their attention, both Australia and U.S.A., in the spirit of sportsmanship that characterizes Davis Cup by BNP Paribas, have agreed to accept the decision of the committee regarding surface for the future tie, the I.T.F. said in its statement."}
{"text": "After his graduation from the University of Delaware in 2012, Steven Rollino moved back home with his parents on Long Island, N.Y. He commuted to work in Manhattan via the Long Island Rail Road.Between the hour-long train ride and the legs on either end, the trip took him more than two hours each way.Weary of the commute, Mr. Rollino, a salesman in the information technology field, decided to team up with two friends to rent a place. Their plan soon stalled. I didnt really have control, Mr. Rollino said. My friends were dragging their feet.About a year ago, he and his parents, Mark and Rosemarie Rollino, decided to buy a starter apartment together. The idea was that it would be an investment property, to be rented out once I get married, have a family and all that, if I move out to the suburbs like everybody, said Mr. Rollino, 26, the eldest of five siblings. We always had that investment piece in our mind.Mr. Rollino contacted Barbara Lindorme, then a saleswoman at Platinum Properties and now at LG Fairmont, whom he had worked with during his rental attempt. He told her he and his parents wanted a one-bedroom for $400,000 to $600,000, in a Midtown or Downtown building that allowed renters.One of the first buildings the three liked was a co-op north of Madison Square Park. A large one-bedroom there, for $595,000 with monthly maintenance in the low $1,400s, was being sold by an architect. The building allowed unlimited renting after two years of ownership.But the apartment, which had been redone with a spartan modern aesthetic, was so individual that it would never be my place  it would always be that other persons place, Mr. Rollino said. They moved on, and the unit sold for $640,000.Mr. Rollino and his parents also liked a large one-bedroom in a 1938 co-op building, this one in the Flatiron district, slightly south of Madison Square Park, for $549,000, with monthly maintenance in the mid-$600s. (The regular maintenance fee was almost $1,000 a month, but a three-year rebate was in effect.)The apartment, on the ground floor, was in the back of the building, so it was away from foot traffic. The familys offer of slightly over the asking price was accepted.To their surprise, another buyer swooped in with a much higher offer  a practice sometimes known as gazumping. The Rollinos declined to counteroffer. The apartment sold for $590,000.The learning curve about the Manhattan market was steep, Mr. Rollinos father said. The apartment is listed under the actual value to draw people in and to draw the prices way over asking, he said. I realized the strategy is to make everybody fight over it. Once you understand the game, then you know how to play it.The Rollinos visited an appealing one-bedroom in a small elevator co-op building near Stuyvesant Square. The price was $529,000, with monthly maintenance in the low $1,300s. The kitchen, however, was a funnel-type kitchen, Mr. Rollino said, with a strange triangular shape.When you have to turn sideways to open your oven, perhaps we should think, Wait a minute,  Ms. Lindorme said. That one sold for the asking price.After nearly a year, despite many weekend apartment visits, the Rollinos were still empty-handed. The coolest part is you dont know whats behind the door, Mr. Rollino said. He was always eager to see  and always surprised at  how much bigger these photographers can make these apartments look.But the hunt, initially interesting, was growing tiresome. Mr. Rollino thought they might have better luck if they focused on studios instead of one-bedrooms.A studio surfaced in the building the Rollinos had originally liked, the one north of Madison Square Park. The apartment, sectioned off with a large bookcase, was being rented out and seemed cluttered. But Mr. Rollino loved the space, a rectangular room with a walk-in closet and a dressing area. The asking price was $420,000, with monthly maintenance in the high $800s.Sometimes going down in price makes things a better find, Ms. Lindorme said.The Rollinos went back several times. I knew that once we got the big bulky bookcase out of there, the whole place would open up, Mr. Rollino said. When we changed our mind-set from looking for a one-bedroom to a studio, all the stars aligned.Several parties were interested, Ms. Lindorme said, but the Rollinos now understood the game, and bought the apartment for $455,000. They closed last summer, and decided to renovate. The plan to redo the floors and walls snowballed into a kitchen and bathroom renovation. It seemed easier to do everything at once than to make changes piecemeal.There are three things that arent brand new, Mr. Rollino said. The dishwasher, the toilet bowl and the tub. They were in really good shape.The renovation took far longer than expected. When its a building and not a house  not a free-standing structure  its tougher than you think, Mr. Rollino said. Even hauling material up and down the steps to the freight elevator was surprisingly time-consuming.Mr. Rollino arrived this winter. He is thrilled with his shorter commute, a 15-minute walk to his office near Penn Station.My health is better, he said. I joined an intramural basketball league and I am able to work out more and am eating healthier. Eliminating the lengthy train trip is overall conducive to a better life.Hes also content in his small space. This is city living, he said. You have to come to a happy medium. You cant have 50 pairs of shoes. You can have 10 pairs of shoes. "}
{"text": "Do you salsa or merengue? the emcee at El Tucn, a supper club in Miami, asked the dolled-up crowd one Saturday night, during its inaugural weekend last October. Me either, she said, winking. This band will get you there.She was right. Soon, audience members were on their feet, swaying and twirling to the 11-piece Latin band, led by the Grammy winner Marlow Rosado. A few couples gave the professionals some competition, then cozied up in banquettes for tequila cocktails, ceviche and savory churros.El Tucn, which opened in the bar-heavy Brickell neighborhood, styles itself as a throwback to another era, when you could see a variety show (feathered chorus girls, absurd clowns and show-stopping vocalists) while having an elegant meal. The lighting is sexily dim and the dcor is full-blown retro glam: golden palm trees, crystal fixtures and tasseled lamps, and servers in tuxes with silk gardenia lapel pins.For inspiration, an owner, Mathieu Massa, a Frenchman based in Miami, took his crew and creative team to Havana, twice. With the thawing of diplomatic relations, they hope to book more Cuban acts, like the singer Cucu Diamantes, who performed during Miami Art Basel. But, Mr. Massa noted proudly, 90 percent of our talent are local, backed by Mr. Rosados house band.The New Zealand-born, French-trained chef, Jean Paul Lourdes, who did culinary research with the big-concept restaurateur Stephen Starr (Buddakan, Morimoto), also looked to local Cubano joints, and the cuisines of Mexico and Peru. Adding his own Asian-cooking background, he turned a roast pork dish into a global suckling porquetta, seasoned with Sichuan peppercorns, cooked sous-vide for 36 hours, then deep-fried and served with a choice of moles.El Tucns $85 prix fixe menu changes weekly, but Mr. Lourdes was aware that it plays second billing to the entertainment. We tried to make the flavor profile intense, he said, so that it almost pops in your mouth and surprises you, but not to distract you from the show.When I dipped in, with an intergenerational group on El Tucns second night in business, the vibe was sultry and luxe, like a Latin version of the Box, the sometimes raunchy New York cabaret. There are early and late seatings, and, for nondiners, an upstairs bar with a view of the stage and a V.I.P. area. We came for dessert  a faithful tres leches cake and an inventive, whimsical Mexican chocolate tasting  but soon, like everyone else, found ourselves dancing."}
{"text": "To find design inspiration for his new condominium building, dOrsay, the developer Matthew Adell didnt have to look far. His office is just steps from the NoMad Hotel, designed by the Parisian architect Jacques Garcia, which he found enchanting.Mr. Adell, who is the president of Adellco, had been captivated by a number of Mr. Garcias projects during his travels, including the Htel Costes in Paris and La Mamounia in Marrakesh, and decided it was time to bring the designers updated take on sumptuous French style to an apartment building in New York.His work is fantastic and world-renowned, and yet he had never done a residential development in Manhattan, Mr. Adell said. We were looking for an elegant, understated building that would stand the test of time.After buying a mid-block lot at 211 West 14th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, Mr. Adell tapped Goldstein, Hill & West Architects to design an 11-story building, and Mr. Garcia to design the interiors.For the exterior, L. Stephen Hill, a partner at Goldstein, Hill & West, said his firm was influenced by buildings in three neighborhoods that intersect near the site: Chelsea, the meatpacking district and the West Village.The resulting design has an industrial feel to it, Mr. Hill said, and a very meatpacking-style entrance canopy. The building will be clad in Roman bricks, he said, which are thinner and longer than conventional bricks: It elongates the proportions and makes for beautiful patterns in the brickwork.Inside, the building has a New York look, but with a strong European feel and quality, said Alvise Orsini, the project manager for dOrsay from Mr. Garcias studio. We wanted to have this idea of industrial architecture, but to create something very refined.Individual units have pale gray oak floors, bathrooms with walls clad in slabs of light Calacatta Caldia marble and strips of darker Nuvolato marble with bronze banding, and kitchen cabinets with a bronze-hued metallic finish. They also have light fixtures Mr. Garcia designed for the Italian manufacturer Zonca and door hardware from the French company Remy Garnier.The lobby is envisioned as a darker, intimate space, with bronze wall panels and beams, a floor of dramatically veined Silver Wave marble and strips of gold mosaic, and a large decorative plaster panel from France depicting stylized flowers, which serves as the focal point behind the reception desk.Amenity spaces include a lower-level spa with a steam room and a plunge pool, a common roof lounge, a bicycle room and a gym. All of them reflect Mr. Garcias vision for refined living.Our gym will be a bit like working out in a James Bond movie, Mr. Adell said. Youre fencing in some elegant living room, so to speak. It has a very residential feel.Work on the buildings foundation is underway, and Mr. Adell said he expects to begin delivering apartments to buyers by the end of the year.The development has 21 units, with one-bedrooms starting at $1.675 million, two-bedrooms at $3.125 million and three-bedrooms at $4.275 million. The highest priced unit is not the full-floor penthouse, but a full-floor apartment on the seventh floor for $8.55 million, with a private outdoor terrace where the building steps back from the street.The development team expects to open a sales gallery this month at 426 West 14th Street. In the meantime, were marketing quietly out of my office, said Mary Ellen Cashman, an associate broker at Stribling & Associates who is the sales director for the project, adding that some units are already in contract.I think the boutique size of the building is very appealing to buyers who dont want to be in an anonymous large building, she said.Mr. Adell said: We like to think that theres a lot of detail going into this thats going to separate it from other product. Its luxury, but downtown, which we believe has limited competition."}
{"text": "In 1721, Boston was a dangerous place. The Massachusetts colonial government barely maintained order, though it needed to. Abenaki Indians were threatening colonists on land while pirates were marauding at sea. Alternative sources of authority were scarce. Fallout from the Salem witch trials of 1692 had discredited the colonys Congregationalist ministers. It didnt help that a young firebrand named Franklin began to print a newspaper that mocked both the government and the ministers. Perhaps most dangerously, smallpox had spread from an infected ship to people ashore. The resulting epidemic is the fever Stephen Coss places at the center of his first book, The Fever of 1721, though his title bundles up all of the citys hot troubles into one big crisis.The history of a year can be revealing, if the right 12 months somehow encapsulate a crucial historical moment or trend. For his momentous year, Coss focuses on a small place, Boston. The Bay Colonys capital had been founded in 1630 as a city upon a hill, built to beam a purified Christian faith to a fallen world. Not all settlers shared that goal, however, and the native peoples of the region routinely opposed it. And yet a later generation of Massachusetts men would help lead the struggle that culminated in American independence. It is easy to assume that the fierce Puritan flock of yore had somehow gestated the fiery patriots of 1776.In Cosss telling, the troubles of 1721 represent a shift away from a colony of faith and toward the modern politics of representative government. So does the emergence of the first independent American newspaper, James Franklins New-England Courant, unsanctioned by the government and a training ground for the editors little brother, Benjamin. Cosss story is a Whig version of history, in which past events helpfully point toward an enlightened present. All the scene needed was a touch of modern science and, voil, the dark ages recede.Enter smallpox. In seeking a solution to the epidemic, the Rev. Cotton Mather wanted to alleviate suffering but also restore public confidence in the clergy. One of his familys African slaves described to him the West African method of inserting pus from a smallpox victim into an uninfected person, who would gain immunity while (usually) suffering only a mild form of the disease. Against opposition, Mather promoted inoculation and a local physician carried it out. The Boston example would become a success story in the development of vaccination, another trend toward the present. Coss thus implies a connection between an American scientific mentality and an American suspicion of authority, both later to blossom in the modern, secular United States.Its a big claim, too simple to be entirely true, as Coss admits. Consider that it was Mather, the man of faith, who preached the science behind inoculation, while the newspaper of the secular James Franklin jeered at it. Coss could also have pointed out that historic changes are not always good for everyone. Can we easily imagine an America today in which Abenakis and other Indians are powerful interest groups and the best medical advice comes from Africa? And whatever the advances in modern science and politics, they can still fail. Since 1979, smallpox has been officially eradicated. But other pests  AIDS, Ebola, the Zika virus  have emerged, and seem to make public health an endlessly receding target. Natural disasters, including climate change, likewise defy scientific or political control. Coss may be too optimistic about the solutions, but hes absolutely right that we continue to underestimate natures challenges and limits. In 2016, the world is still a dangerous place."}
{"text": "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  In the expanding realm ruled by Randal J. Kirk, sliced apples dont brown. Salmon grow twice as fast without swimming upriver to spawn. Beloved cats are reborn.And male mosquitoes are unleashed with the sole mission to mate, pass on a gene that kills their offspring, and die.A few decades ago, the foods and creatures nurtured by Mr. Kirk would have been found only in dystopian fantasies like those written by Margaret Atwood. But Mr. Kirks company, Intrexon, is fast becoming one of the worlds most diverse biotechnology companies, with ventures ranging from unloved genetically engineered creatures to potential cancer cures and gene therapies, gasoline substitutes, cloned kittens and even glow-in-the-dark Dino Pet toys made from microbes.Until recently, Mr. Kirk, 62, was a relatively unknown, self-made billionaire, buying up or investing in companies in the biotech world. So when Intrexon acquired the British company Oxitec last summer, it attracted little attention as he extended his reach into genetically modified insects.But that move has thrust Mr. Kirk into the forefront of a scramble to control the Zika virus, suspected of causing babies to be born with tiny heads and damaged brains. It is rampant in Latin America and threatening the United States.While Zika was not on his radar when the deal was announced, Mr. Kirk now appears to be the prescient owner of a potential bioweapon  Oxitecs genetically engineered mosquitoes, which he says could save millions of people from Zika by causing the population of wild disease-transmitting mosquitoes to self-destruct.I think that we have the only safe, effective, field-proven and ready-to-deploy solution, Mr. Kirk, who is usually called R.J., said in an interview in his office here overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway. In Piracicaba, Brazil, the population of wild mosquitoes has fallen 82 percent in the neighborhood where the mosquitoes are being tested, he said.If his plans to sell the engineered mosquitoes succeed, Mr. Kirk will fortify his near cultlike status among some investors and colleagues who marvel at his shrewd (and somewhat lucky) investments.Perhaps more important, a victory against the rapidly spreading epidemic could weaken opposition to genetically engineered organisms of all sorts, propelling many others out of the lab, onto the dinner table or into the environment.Now Mr. Kirk must persuade federal agencies, foreign governments and nonprofit health organizations to place orders. He must counter caution from the World Health Organization and federal officials, who question whether the technique will be effective on a large scale. And he must overcome qualms about genetic engineering that have prompted opposition to the mosquitoes in the Florida Keys and elsewhere.We dont have experience about living transgenic mosquitoes in the air, said Dr. Artur Timerman, an infectious disease specialist in Brazil. What will be the midterm or long-term consequences of this?Mr. Kirk is assembling a powerful lobbying effort, employing the law firm Sidley Austin in Washington as well as relying on one of Intrexons board members, Cesar Alvarez, the senior chairman of the prominent law firm Greenberg Traurig, and Intrexons head of corporate communications, Jack Bobo, who once directed biotechnology trade policy at the State Department.Dr. Luciana Borio, acting chief scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, told a House subcommittee on Wednesday that the agency was greatly expediting Oxitecs application to test the mosquitoes in the Florida Keys and would issue a draft environmental assessment very soon.But when asked by Representative Morgan Griffith, a Republican who represents the Virginia district in which Mr. Kirk has a farm, Dr. Borio said the F.D.A. would not eliminate the opportunity for the public to then comment on the draft.What we dont know right now is where the public stands on this in the setting of Zika, she said later in the hearing.Selling his mosquitoes to combat an international epidemic could help relieve the pressure Mr. Kirk is under to prove that Intrexon is more than just a collection of odd science projects, and that it can actually make money and fulfill his vision for a new golden age of biotechnology.He considers this time to be a seminal moment in history, one in which the rapidly improving ability to read and write  and rewrite  the DNA code of life will make it possible to engineer all manner of organisms to perform specific tasks.I think this is the most significant industrial vector to occur in history, he said, comparing it to semiconductor technology that gave rise to smartphones and the web.And the same DNA tools can be applied to numerous areas. Intrexons scientists, he says, dont care if they are working on a primary human T cell or an avocado. Reflecting that vision, Intrexon uses the web domain name dna.com.The engineering of life is often called synthetic biology, a vaguely defined term meant to convey more systematic genetic manipulation than the cutting and pasting of a single gene that gave rise to early biotechnology companies like Amgen and Genentech. At its most distant point, synthetic biologists would sit at a computer designing life forms from scratch, then hit print and have the necessary DNA made to order to be inserted into a cell.Numerous companies are moving into the field, but Intrexon is literally the elephant in the room of the synthetic biology industry, said John Cumbers, chief executive of SynBioBeta, a fledgling trade group.His supporters say that if anyone can pull off such an enterprise it is R. J. Kirk, whom they call an uncommon visionary and quick study, though he lacks formal training in science. When Mr. Kirk tells people, as he often does, that he is just a country lawyer, they know theyre about to get a schooling in biology or business, interlaced with references to history, philosophy and opera.He has an astonishing grasp of science, said Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute who now runs Intrexons health division. Dr. Broder recalled one instance in which it took him a day to understand the intricacies of a genetic disease. Mr. Kirk, after hearing Dr. Broders explanation, got it in five minutes.Even the hedge fund manager Thomas U. Barton, who made his mark as a skeptical short-seller, gushes. He understands all businesses, he said.Still, there are skeptics. It is hard to judge the strength of Intrexons core technology, known as UltraVector, which is a computerized system for putting together modular DNA pieces to make complex genetic circuits. The company, saying it wants to protect its trade secrets, has not published articles about it in scientific literature. Some start-up companies, not Intrexon, have taken the lead in the hot new genome editing technique called Crispr.The biggest criticism is that Intrexon keeps announcing new acquisitions and new collaborations, dozens of them in all. Yet no product made with the companys technology has reached the market, and it is not clear when any will.Theres a mixture here of spectacle and speculation, said Jim Thomas of the nonprofit ETC Group, which says that synthetic biology needs to be more rigorously regulated. Whats curious about this is the way in which they are putting together all these controversial and often failing one-trick companies and trying to wrap them up in a fancy synthetic biology front.Intrexons shares have fallen to about $37 from near $70 in July, though biotech stocks in general have also fallen. The companys market value is $4.3 billion, making Mr. Kirks 53 percent worth over $2 billion.One big commercial opportunity could be Intrexons pilot project to use genetically altered microbes to turn natural gas, which is cheap and abundant, into isobutanol, a liquid fuel that can be used in cars. Investors want to see if Intrexons partner, the energy giant Dominion, commits to building a commercial plant, which Mr. Kirk hopes could happen as early as this year.And the Oxitec mosquitoes, while not something Intrexon developed itself, offer a bonus that Mr. Kirk could not have predicted. The mosquitoes were developed mainly to fight dengue fever, and that alone, Mr. Kirk said, made it worthwhile to pay about $160 million for Oxitec.But because Zika is spread by the same type of mosquito, the Oxitec insects, which contain a lethality gene  can be used. When the male mosquitoes are released to mate with wild females, the offspring die before reaching adulthood.Intrexon is now building a factory in Piracicaba to produce 60 million male mosquitoes a week, enough to protect at least 300,000 people, and Mr. Kirk believes production could be increased to cover entire cities or countries.Costs may vary, depending on the concentration of mosquitoes, Mr. Kirk said. At $7.50 a person, which Technology Review magazine reported would be the price in Piracicaba, protecting a city of one million people would cost $7.5 million a year.But some experts say it will take a lot of time and money to scale up, and that it is not clear if the technique reduces disease transmission.And there are other new competing techniques for mosquito control that do not involve genetic engineering and therefore may have a quicker acceptance. One, pushed by the International Atomic Energy Agency, sterilizes lab mosquitoes with radiation so they cant reproduce when they are released.Mr. Kirk dismissed concerns about the Oxitec mosquitoes. They contain a few well-characterized genetic changes, he said, while radiation produces millions of unknown mutations. Regulators giving sterilized mosquitoes a lower hurdle is tantamount to giving an award for ignorance, he said.In asserting that opposition to genetic engineering was mostly born of fear based on lack of knowledge, Mr. Kirk contended that synthetic biology was not optional if society wanted to maintain its living standards. If that sounds like something Monsanto, the leader in biotech crops might say, it could be because Mr. Kirk recruited Robert B. Shapiro, former chief executive of Monsanto, to be Intrexons lead outside director.Among the better-known products Intrexon is preparing for market is the genetically engineered apple that resists browning when sliced, which Intrexon acquired when it bought Okanagan Specialty Fruits last year. The company plans to start sales next year.Intrexon also owns a majority stake in AquaBounty Technologies, whose fast-growing salmon is the first genetically engineered animal to win  federal approval for a spot on American dinner plates. Mr. Kirk basically saved the company, which was in danger of running out of money, Ronald L. Stotish, the chief executive of AquaBounty, said.Mr. Kirks progression to biotech mogul was almost by chance. An Air Force brat who grew up in various states, He said he spent some of his teenage years playing guitar in clubs but grew disenchanted with the prospect of a musicians life.After studying business at Radford University, he embarked on his first venture, a television station in rural Virginia, while still in law school. He eventually gave up on that but not before moving to tiny Bland, Va., where he was the towns only lawyer. The towns only pharmacist, John Gregory, enlisted him in 1983 to start a drug distribution business, General Injectables and Vaccines. It was sold for $65 million in late 1998.Mr. Kirks biggest score was New River Pharmaceuticals, which was developing a stimulant to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder that was supposed to be less susceptible to abuse than existing products. While regulators ultimately deemed the drug no less prone to abuse than other products, Shire acquired New River for $2.6 billion in 2007 and made the product, Vyvanse, the successor to Adderall XR, which was losing patent protection. Mr. Kirk, who owned about half of New River, became a billionaire.A similar pattern occurred with Clinical Data, which was trying to develop a genetic test to predict which patients would be most likely to benefit from the companys experimental antidepressant. The genetic testing did not work but the antidepressant was approved anyway, and Clinical Data was acquired by Forest Laboratories for $1.2 billion.I would never bet against R. J. Kirk, said Fred Koller, a former Intrexon executive. Its not necessarily the starting point that is successful, but he always gets there.Named for parts of genes called introns and exons, Intrexon was founded in 1998 by Thomas D. Reed and his wife, Jackie, to supply DNA constructs for research with genetically engineered mice. The company moved in 2004 to Blacksburg, Va., to take advantage of economic incentives and landed in the orbit of Mr. Kirks investment firm, Third Security. Mr. Kirk envisioned applications for the technology far beyond mice, investing $300 million and assuming control of the company. He took Intrexon public in 2013.My impression of R. J. has pretty much stayed one of perpetual awe, said Dr. Reed, who is Intrexons chief science officer. I joke that he is a mix of Leonard Cohen and Prince, he said, combining a deep soulful understanding of the world with a risk-taking flamboyance.Mr. Kirk, who once had a ponytail and still wears Birkenstocks and collarless shirts even to some formal business meetings, composes electronic music. Every year at Christmastime he sends his executives and hundreds of other people copies of a book he deems interesting. Last years was The Railway Journey: The Industrialization of Time and Space in the 19th Century, by the German cultural historian Wolfgang Schivelbusch.Married and divorced three times, Mr. Kirk has four children ranging in age from 6 to the early 40s. The oldest, Julian, works for his fathers investment firm, Third Security.While Oxitec is nominally headquartered in Germantown, Md., Mr. Kirk spends most of his time in West Palm Beach. His home, on a narrow stretch of land, has property extending from the Atlantic Ocean to the Intracoastal Waterway. He also keeps a residence in the Four Seasons Hotel in San Francisco and owns a 7,200-acre cattle farm near Radford, Va., where he used to raise falcons, hawks, owls and eagles, tramping through the woods to roust squirrels and rabbits that the birds would eat.You are mutual predators, you are partners in the hunt, said Mr. Kirk. The thrilling part, really, is the opportunity to enter into a relationship on the animals terms, on terms the bird understands.Now hes too busy, he says, running Intrexon, which has grown to about 750 employees and has acquired a lot of basic technology beyond UltraVector.The company lost $84.5 million on revenue of $173.6 million for last year. Half the revenues came from an established business that Intrexon acquired  Trans Ova Genetics, which sells embryos and other products for cattle breeding.Much of the remaining revenue comes from its partnerships with companies who pay to use its technology. For instance, Fibrocell is developing a gene therapy for a rare genetic skin disease and OvaScience is researching a way for women to undergo in vitro fertilization without needing hormone shots.Most of these ventures involve smaller companies in which Mr. Kirk or Intrexon now owns stakes.Its most important collaboration is probably with Ziopharm Oncology, a cancer drug company.One project involves gene therapy to treat cancer. It uses a gene switch from Intrexon that acts like a light dimmer, allowing production of an immune-boosting protein inside the body to be decreased if needed to avoid side effects.An Intrexon competitor with similar broad scope is Synthetic Genomics, which is also controlled by a wealthy, visionary entrepreneur, the genome scientist J. Craig Venter.Perhaps tougher competition will come from more focused companies.For example, Intrexon and Ziopharm are behind more specialized companies in engineering cancer patients immune system cells so they can better attack tumors. One of those specialized companies, Juno Therapeutics, has a market value almost as high as Intrexons.We have multiple projects right now, any of which should be worth more than our total market cap, said Mr. Kirk, somewhat in frustration.If anything in Intrexons pipeline works, say perhaps the mosquitoes, the companys value could climb sharply. Mr. Kirk vowed to make that happen.This is my last company, he said. I cant imagine anything else that I will ever see that will be as compelling as Intrexon."}
{"text": "Chuck and Wendy retire to the bedroom after a long night. Its the first time theyve seen each other since earlier that morning, and theyre dutifully exchanging Whats up? questions. Chuck casually lies about how he spent his evening; Wendy casually lies about how she spent her evening. At this point in their marriage, the lies are as routine as slipping on their pajamas  so routine that it isnt immediately obvious to the viewer that theyre lying to each other at all. Theres no hitch in their voices or calculated hitch in their strides. Theyre keeping secrets from each other betraying each other, in fact  but theres no indication this is an uncommon night. This is their marriage.But does that make it a bad marriage?Sundays episode of Billions goes further than any previous hour in puzzling out the mysteries of its New York power couples, but lets continue with Chuck and Wendy, the most curious partnership of the two. Do they have a bad marriage? The obvious answer is yes, given that the secrets theyre keeping (Chucks especially) could tear it asunder. If Chuck were honest about how he spent his evening, Wendy would have learned that hed broken his promise to recuse himself from the case against her boss. If Wendy were honest about how shed spent her evening, Chuck would have learned that she was having drinks with a headhunter who shed clandestinely solicited to help find her another job. Their sins may not be equivalent, despite the flirty overtures between Wendy and the headhunter, but theyre bad enough for each not to want the other to know the truth.Yet this is also how their marriage works. Chuck and Wendy are independent, career-driven individuals who have ambitions separate from their marriage, and which now happen to be in conflict. The Punch smartly clarifies their peculiar chemistry by contrasting it with a marriage more of the traditional, one-heart, lovey-dovey variety. Over Chucks fervent objections, the Rhoades have dinner with another couple who have made the active decision to merge their personal and professional lives and go into business together. They see each other all day. They share the same password. And as for division of duties, the husband says: I handle the hugs. She takes care of the kisses.The dinner forces the Rhoades to confront the state of their marriage, and they wind up answering with an odd mix of contrition and defiance. They roll their eyes and laugh it off. Wendy gives Chuck a hard slap, and theyre off to a particularly boisterous S-and-M session, at least based on the handcuffs and ropes scattered on the floor the next morning. At the same time, Chuck leaves his password on a Post-it note as a gesture of intimacy  maybe an empty gesture, like his official recusal, but a sign that their lives are shared. They dont need to tell each other everything, though. And if it means rewriting the basic tenets of marriage, so be it.The Axelrods, on the other hand, have the more harmonious union of the two, but The Punch locates a couple points of contention. For one, Lara has to account for Bobbys impulsiveness, but she often finds herself in the position of doing damage control after the fact. For example, she can remind him of the existential peril of going to war with the United States attorneys office  the lost friends, the dwindled fortune, the possible jail time  but her voice in Bobbys head doesnt prevent him from tearing up that $1.9 billion check and throwing it in Chucks face. And this week, she cant hope to stop Bobby from punching a neighbor for driving drunk with their kids in the car, even though she surely understands the consequences before he does. She might roll her eyes or remind Bobby of the high stakes to his reckless behavior, but she mostly has to clean up his messes. At the same time, she also understands that recklessness is his business: Nobody clears margins that high on Wall Street without outrageous risk.Despite their enormous wealth, the Axelrods carry the toughness of their hardscrabble upbringing into the world of elites, which occasionally turns Lara into a mob-wife enforcer, issuing threats and muffin baskets full of cash. But Sunday, their agendas diverged over whether or not their sons should inherit that toughness. The boys were born into privilege and entitlement, and its softened them up so much that Lara forces them to wade into chilly waters to dig for clams and spend the night camping in a tent with local scouts. Bobby goes along with his wifes initiative, but he doesnt agree with it. In his mind, toughness served them on the road to wealth, but now that theyve arrived at their destination, the kids dont need to know struggle. Theyve been freed from that.When Bobby scoops up the boys in the middle of the night and drives them off to fatten up on milkshakes, hes not just following his own initiative, but defying Laras. Their partnership may be healthier over all than the Rhoades, but to a certain degree, neither one is a true partnership  not when theyre keeping secrets, like Chuck and Wendy, or undermining each others authority, like Bobby does to Lara. The Punch exposes the volatility of both marriages, and suggests it as a natural consequence of individual aggression and power. Leave other couples to handle the hugs and kisses. Their love is a hard slap to the face. The soundtrack selections continue to be choice. The episode opens with the Replacements The Ledge, a song that doesnt evoke much outside the greatness of the Replacements, but the closer, the Pixies Debaser, hits its chorus with a thrilling close-up of Bobby peeling away from the camp, grinning like the devil. Chucks rivalry with Spyros, his sniveling nemesis from the S.E.C., is starting to seem like an edgier version of Jerry and Newman from Seinfeld, with Spyros existing almost for the sole purpose of irritating Chuck. A cortado? On a Sunday? Newman! Donnie Caan becomes the latest Axe Capital insider to get flipped for the United States attorneys office, and surely a softer target than Dollar Bill. Recall that Donnie is the one who suggested Apple stock still had room to grow at a meeting, which was like watching a child give an oral report on a book he hadnt read. Donnies real problem is that people can see right through him. Wendy is already looking askance. The headhunter is played by Steven Pasquale, whos currently starring as Detective Mark Fuhrman in American Crime Story: The People vs. O.J. Simpson. If youre watching both shows, his flirtation with Wendy may have a creepier, more predatory feel than intended. Casting John Carroll Lynch as part of the perfect couple that dines with the Rhoades is a small masterstroke. Viewers will remember Lynch as Norm Gunderson, husband of Frances McDormands Marge in the Coen brothers Fargo, a film that offered their marriage as an avatar of warmth and fulfillment. Theres no better partner than Norm son of a Gunderson. Line of the night: We both know the playing field is tilted like a craps table in Tombstone, Ariz., and Bobby Axelrod is the one who is sawing the legs."}
{"text": "Barely four minutes into Jerrod Carmichaels 2014 debut comedy special, Love at the Store, he makes a joke about the death of Trayvon Martin. Money changes you, Carmichael tells the audience, recounting how he recently entered his upscale apartment building wearing a hooded sweatshirt and made it through the lobby unquestioned by his doorman. I was concerned, he says. I pay a lot of money  like, a lot of money  so that niggas in hoodies like me cant waltz by you. Addressing the doorman, he adds, Next time, stand your ground. The laughter that greets this phrase is scattered and uneasy, but Carmichael only digs in. Really? he says. Cause, like, that Trayvon [expletive] is really affecting your day to day  you wake up, have your cup of coffee, and you do this  he blows a kiss  to a picture of Trayvon. And then you start your day. Is that what you do? Carmichael grins genially. Cause you dont.Carmichael has one of stand-ups most unorthodox approaches to exploring race and class, and in building to his Martin joke, he assumes an unexpected voice: that of the race traitor. While working on Love at the Store, Carmichael argued about this bit with Spike Lee, who signed on to direct the special at his request. I just didnt think it was funny, Lee wrote in an email, and it was too soon to be making a joke about Martins coldblooded murder. Carmichael  insisting that his aim was not to mock a dead teenager but to explore what it means to truly care about his death  kept it in. I want to be a voice that challenges, Carmichael told me recently.He takes this mandate to extremes that can verge on perverse. Consider the bit, soon after the Martin joke, about how Carmichael cant wait to grow rich enough to say Republican things out loud such as: I dont think people on welfare should be allowed to eat breakfast ... which is kind of true when you think about it. Like, youre building up your strength for what? The satire and ironic distance here is sliced razor-thin; it gets thinner still when Carmichael, declaring that some people are more important than others, describes looking at my little cousin, and you can just tell hes gonna work at Wendys. Like, you could see it in his eyes: He has Wendy eyes. By the time Carmichael arrives at his own account of police brutality  he was once slammed to the ground by L.A.P.D. officers, their guns drawn, because I fit a description  he is on the way to a point about how Americas racist legacy is worth accepting because, were it not for slavery, I would be in Africa right now. Africa. Are you hearing what Im saying to you? Like, they have AIDS there. Jammed end to end with such jokes, Carmichaels special is unrelentingly bleak  even toxic in its nihilism. And yet Carmichael remains supremely affable, speaking in a slow, honeyed voice and smiling throughout. Your groans, he tells the crowd, will only make me go deeper.At 28, Carmichael is one of Hollywoods fastest-rising young comics, and his preoccupation in Love at the Store is black-American success: systematically thwarted, highly politicized and something he enjoys all the same. In 2011, impressed by his stand-up, the makers of New Girl asked Carmichael to test for Winston, a main character, but he turned them down, uninterested in tying himself to someone elses sitcom. That self-assurance paid off. NBC eventually picked up his own sitcom, The Carmichael Show, and the same week that he shot Love at the Store, the hit feature comedy Neighbors  which starred Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne  arrived in multiplexes, with Carmichael in a scene-stealing role. (Initially envisioned as a white Jewish kid, the part was rewritten for him.) This month, The Carmichael Show returns for its second season; a Neighbors sequel, again featuring Carmichael, arrives in May.The comedian Neal Brennan, a creator of Chappelles Show, was an early mentor. Praising the way that Carmichaels disarming, bright-eyed delivery belies the grimness of his message, he told me that at its best, Jerrods stand-up shows America/humanity at its worst  capitalist, cutthroat, cynical, narcissistic. Even so, the speed of Carmichaels ascent took him by surprise. In 2010 or so, we got something to eat, and I explained everything that was gonna happen in his career, Brennan said. And I was right, except I mapped out way more hardship than he encountered. A more recent admirer of Carmichaels is 93-year-old Norman Lear, the man behind classic sitcoms like All in the Family and The Jeffersons and, according to Carmichael, a major influence on The Carmichael Show. Lear told me that Carmichaels comedy helps America look at itself in the mirror, adding, He sees the foolishness of the human condition  he understands that there is humor to be found in the darkest of places.In late January, Carmichael was at his sitcoms production offices, trying to find the humor in a particularly dark place. The week before, he taped Episode 202, in which the Carmichael family  a working-class North Carolina household modeled on his own  struggles with the tarnished legacy of Bill Cosby, the master comedian and suspect in multiple rapes. Standing in an editing room, Carmichael, who is 6-foot-1, wore a hoodie, fitted jeans and Timberland work boots. He faced a monitor as his editor, Kirk Benson, dialed up the Cosby episodes closing minute.I did a line off the top of my head at the very end that might ruin the entire episode, Carmichael said as he watched David Alan Grier, who plays Carmichaels father, Joe, do a virtuoso, sweet-natured impression of Cosby holding court. This cracked up the other fictional Carmichaels and elicited big laughs from the studio audience. Amid this jubilation, Jerrod smilingly interjected, Damn shame what he did to those women, though. Although the line was unscripted, Grier gamely caught Carmichaels splash of cold water, dropping the smile from his face.The Carmichael Show is, among other things, an attempt to prove that a multicamera sitcom, in the venerable but dusty tradition of All in the Family, can command a place in the pop-cultural vanguard while attracting broad audiences. The success of series like Empire and black-ish has hammered home the fact that black-led shows need not be considered niche entertainment. Carmichael theorizes that these shows helped strengthen NBCs resolve in supporting The Carmichael Show, which features an entirely black cast. The shows chief selling point  besides the prodigious talents of Grier and Loretta Devine, a veteran actor who plays Jerrods mother  is its social relevance. Carmichael and his staff build scripts around hot-button issues, producing episodes like Gender, which involves a transgender teenager and features a cold-open riff about the drawbacks of removing Confederate flags from government buildings. The only thing worse than racism is surprise racism, Jerrod says in the show, making the case for letting the flag fly.Carmichael says that, whereas rebuttals to his stand-up jokes can only be implied, on the show he and his writers are able to stage counterarguments via the other characters. The premise of Episode 202, titled Fallen Heroes, is that Jerrod scores tickets to see Cosby perform; his girlfriend, Maxine, is appalled; debates ensue. (The shows creators solicited outside opinions on the episode, including from Judd Apatow  one of Cosbys most prominent Hollywood critics  and Darnell Hunt, a professor of sociology and director of African-American studies at U.C.L.A., whom Carmichael brought on last year as a series consultant to help him navigate controversial issues.) Carmichael offered few details about the Cosby story line, but if one of his old stand-up bits is any indication, the results will not be milquetoast: Arguing that talent is more important than morals, Carmichael cites the abhorred 2014 RoboCop remake, deeming it so atrocious that halfway through it, I forgave Woody Allen.In the editing room, considering his damn shame line, Carmichael said, It might be more interesting to fade out on the warm feeling, because the line I say is, sadly, implied the whole episode, anyway. He pursed his lips and walked into the hall. I try to avoid having a message, he went on. The risk here is that the whole episode is a gray area, and that lines black  I wanted to watch my delivery, to see if it allowed for gray.In Carmichaels comedy, the line between unflinching provocation and outright trolling can grow fuzzy. He says hes fueled by a Socratic curiosity: What about this? What if what you think is right is wrong? This manifests most shockingly when, breaking the unwritten comedy rule against punching down, Carmichael makes some of societys most disempowered people the objects of seeming cruelty. In the joke about his Wendys-destined little cousin  delivered in the aftermath of Trayvon Martins death and mere months before the killings of Michael Brown and Tamir Rice  the target is a black boy. Elsewhere its black women, as when Carmichael mocks Beyoncs single Run the World (Girls) as too ambitious for most of the bitches in her fan base, suggesting she sing instead about being a shift manager at Arbys, or a dental hygienist. You can watch this joke on YouTube courtesy of an anti-feminist account called F3MH8R, which underscores the queasy way that some of his lines could be transplanted into bigots mouths almost verbatim. Carmichael takes this, however, as a point of counterintuitive pride: Its become increasingly easy, in art, to only listen to people you already agree with, he told me. Thats boring.If a black comics audience includes many white fans, as Carmichaels does, the dynamics surrounding such jokes can be particularly fraught. Some liberal-minded whites doubtless enjoy hearing black comics make jokes at white peoples expense because they like to imagine, in a self-congratulatory way, that their laughter constitutes an act of penance and expiation: by chuckling, they may feel they are insulating themselves against charges of racism and demonstrating their own enlightenment. But Carmichaels jokes, routinely directed not at the perpetrators and beneficiaries of racism but at its victims, dont permit any such easy feelings  if I, well-intentioned liberal, laugh at a joke about a black boys scarce self-worth, what does that say about the sway that negative black stereotypes have over me?Then there is the white fan who laughs with no such unease. Dave Chappelle has invoked this figure in explaining why he stepped away from his hit sketch series: in part, he worried that some white viewers appreciated his anarchic treatment of black stereotypes for misguided reasons  that, in effect, his comedy risked compounding rather than dismantling those stereotypes. Neal Brennan touched on this issue while interviewing Carmichael during a 2015 podcast, identifying something almost anti-black in Love at the Store. Its not anti-black, Carmichael replied. Its anti-allowing-yourself-to-be-a-victim.When I raised this topic with Carmichael, he reiterated that his jokes were intended as motivational tough love. He said he heartily rejects the pull up your pants mantras and bootstrap narratives of black respectability politics but aims nonetheless to encourage personal responsibility: Its not saying Im on the systems side; its me saying Im determined to beat it, and join me, why dont you? As for the reactions and possible misinterpretations of white fans, these were not foremost among Carmichaels concerns. Im not talking to you; its not about you, he told me. Im not talking about that cousin with Wendy eyes for anyone but that cousin with Wendy eyes.Elaborating, Carmichael pointed to his joke about turning Republican and denying poor people breakfast. Id taken it as a layered critique of right-wing callousness. He acknowledged this but added that the joke also represented an extreme argument for freedom. Being black, you hear sentences like, Black people dont blank. How inhibiting is that? Like, how come I havent gone snowboarding? Because embedded in me is a belief that black people dont snowboard. So its a challenge of saying, Im not supposed to be a Republican, but I can do anything. Im breaking the ultimate rule, politically  Im so free in that joke its almost disgusting.Growing up, the kids in Carmichaels neighborhood werent expected  or set up  to amount to much, he said. There was a path laid out for me by circumstance, decided at birth, that I sent back. He characterized the Morningside Manor section of Winston-Salem, where hes from, as all black, lot of very nice, hardworking, honest people, some people that werent, adding, It was the type of neighborhood where my mothers only goal was that I get a high-school diploma. Cynthia Carmichael worked as a secretary; Joe Carmichael is a truck driver. Joe told me that Jerrod displayed an early taste for show business: I built a clubhouse in the backyard, and when he was 8 or 9, he and his friends decorated it into a haunted house and charged admission. Jerrods older brother, Joe Jr., recalls Jerrods constantly toting around the video camera hed begged for one Christmas: If I was playing ball, hed be on the side, taping us, interviewing the players.In adolescence, I was kinda awkward, kinda quiet, Carmichael said. My sneakers were wack. Id get picked on. Toward the end of middle school, however, I remember discovering humor and a boldness that came with it. Other parts of growing up in Morningside were far harder: A friend of mine, Marcus, was murdered. A friend of mine, Hasan, was murdered. These things would just happen. Very regular moments could hurt you a lot: I remember getting a ride home with a buddy of mine. Were talking about algebra II, and suddenly he says, I need to stop really fast, takes the air vent off the dashboard and pulls out some crack to sell. And that was not unique.Carmichael had an autodidactic drive, spurred by his parents, who engaged their boys in debates replicated on his show  about entertainment, religion, politics. Being from the hood, I had no access to certain things  its a clich, but I didnt know who Paul Thomas Anderson was, he said. I didnt know who the Coen Brothers were. He recalled staying up till 3 a.m. reading about the Defenestrations of Prague on Wikipedia, or spending eight hours at the Barnes & Noble, posted up in an aisle with a cup of coffee. This was also a reaction to institutional failure. I remember when I was in eighth grade, the assistant superintendent came to my school. Id visited a white middle school recently and noticed a difference. More computers. Nicer. I remember raising my hand and asking, Why dont we have those things? His response was: You see those new tables in the cafeteria? Were looking out for you. Right then, I said, Im not relying on this system to get where I need to be.Carmichael sold sneakers at a Finish Line, nursing abstract dreams of a stand-up career that friends stoked. I didnt want to start in North Carolina, he said. I went to a club in Greensboro once, and knew I wasnt gonna start there. Im competitive; I wanna go up after Louis C.K. His thinking, he continued, was: Where are the best people doing this? Take me to them. One day at work, a guy came into the store, said he was an actor in L.A. I said, Man, L.A., I really wanna move there. And he said: Then just move. Go to Craigslist, Westside Rentals, find a place. I said, O.K.Carmichael headed west in 2008, crashing in shared studio apartments and hitting open-mike nights not just at proper clubs but also in living rooms and bars. I annoyed so many people who were trying to watch hockey games. The comedian Hannibal Buress, who befriended Carmichael, recalls being impressed by the tough angles he took into risqu material, and his willingness to lose a crowd in the service of an idea  he doesnt care about bombing. Of the apparent audacity of his move to Los Angeles, Carmichael told me: I dont like safety nets. Like, a lot of comedians, they bring friends to their first show. And their second and third. You have a net there, crutches, guaranteed pity laughs. I dont want that.On the day I first met him, in January, Carmichael was due to rehearse scenes from the next episode of his show, 203, on the soundstage near Beverly Hills where The Carmichael Show is made. Episode 203 takes place largely at a funeral parlor: Jerrods paternal grandfather, William, dies, sending Griers Joe into an ambivalent funk, because William was an abusive alcoholic; Joe wonders if he doesnt owe him a sanitized eulogy anyway. The episode would be taped twice the next day and assembled from both performances: if a joke didnt go over at 4 p.m., alternative lines, or alts, could be tried at 7. The production crew had constructed a spacious set for the funeral-service scene. Adjoining it was a cramped, impressively ugly antechamber  floral-print settee, chintzy sconces, sad carpet. An open brown coffin with a dummy corpse jutted toward the cameras. Most of this episode plays really claustrophobically, in this room, with the coffin, Carmichael said. There was originally supposed to be just one moment in here, but I expanded it to, like, 25 pages. Its not that long now, but I like pushing to see how far you can go within a limitation.Carmichael aims to at once embrace and break the format of multicamera sitcoms, and visual monotony is just one of his strategies. In Episode 201, Jerrod makes a harsh joke about cancer, and in the cut I saw, the crowd responded with an audible disapproval that hadnt been scrubbed from the laugh track. Usually you dont keep that take, you use an alt, Carmichael said. But at the taping, I just kept saying that same line, so there is no alt. The crowd kind of winces. You hear them react to it unhappily. Im like, keep that reaction.Thanks to Season 1s ratings, which were strong enough to bolster executives faith in him, Carmichael has some creative leeway. In Episode 203, Joe recalls Williams abuse in graphic detail, delivering tough lines about beatings and chokeholds. Carmichael said, The studio read this script and they were like  he inhaled sharply, miming pain  and I told them, Its gonna get sad for a bit. We can stay heavy. Its O.K.Carmichaels willingness to stay heavy  to create prolonged moments of discomfort  may be the most formally radical thing about him. In his sitcom and his stand-up, he can seem as satisfied provoking groans, or awkward silence, as he is provoking laughter. At work here is a fundamental reconsideration of a joke tellers function: With Carmichael, the goal is not only to orchestrate a series of raucous eruptions  signaling, as they do, a simpatico mind meld with the audience  but to generate rifts of displeasure, confusion and anger too. Danielle Sanchez-Witzel, the showrunner on The Carmichael Show, said that such emotions can be productive: Jerrod likes to make people uncomfortable not for the sake of making them uncomfortable, but to shake them out of their regular way of seeing the world.I saw this in action a couple of nights later, when Carmichael invited me along for an unannounced appearance at the Comedy Store in West Hollywood  the site not just of his HBO special but also of his first-ever L.A. open mike, in 2008. Carmichael had scribbled some notes earlier that night, but mostly he winged his set. I dont know what to talk about, he said onstage, but in a good way. Im open. Wearing a bomber over a gray hoodie, he paced, took long pauses and fussed with different things  his lip, a bottle cap, the mike stand. This was not a result of nerves, he told me later, but a deliberate technique to think through jokes and inculcate the crowd in his unhurried cadences. At one point he took off his jacket: I wasnt hot, he explained. Its to let you know: Relax. Listen. Lets explore.The Iowa caucuses loomed, and Carmichael had politics in mind. He got medium-size laughs with a medium-grade Bernie Sanders joke  Hell be the first president in history to broker a nuclear deal with a mustard stain on his shirt  then grew more familiarly challenging as he defended Donald Trumps proposed wall along the Mexican border: You dont just have an open wall at your apartment, like, I like my neighbors to be able to come in if they feel oppressed.Where this riff led, however, was wholly unexpected: Im thinking about not voting, Carmichael said. I dont trust America anyway. Can I say: I dont think we went to the moon? For the next few minutes, he contended that the manned Apollo missions had been faked. All of you are crazy for believing it, but we dont have time to get into the real facts because its not funny. People tittered, but with notes of hesitation and befuddlement, as they tried to suss out Carmichaels relationship to this bizarre tangent. I think its kinda cool we made it up, he went on. Thats so American. Lying about a moon landing? Thats so us.Later that night, he told me that the moon-landing material reflected a deep-seated mistrust of authority that animates nearly every joke he tells and that has been with him since his youth in Morningside. You think we went to the moon? he said. Well, the same people said the drinking water is safe in Flint, Mich. His point was that conspiracy theories about nefarious government action  which circulate not only among crackpots but also among marginalized people with legitimate social grievances  were sometimes revealed to be the stuff of actual government behavior. I dont want people to be comfortable in the black-and-white that were handed, he continued. When you grow up and a lot of things people tell you arent true, you learn to challenge and question everything. If youre in Flint and the government said the water is safe to drink, and you find out it wasnt, and they knew. ...Carmichael trailed off for a moment, shaking his head, then declared, Its up to you to figure out the truth for yourself."}

{"text": "Not every major leaguer is lucky enough to have a lighthearted reunion with his former teammates the first time he faces them in a new uniform.But Jordan Zimmermann, who pitched for the Washington Nationals for seven seasons before signing a five-year, $110 million deal with Detroit over the winter, gazed into many friendly faces in his Tigers debut  and got the better of them. He retired eight of the nine batters he faced Saturday at the Nationals spring-training home in Viera, Fla.Its definitely fun getting out there and attacking these guys after all the smack talk, a smiling Zimmermann said. They said when I moved on they were going to take me deep. It was a good outing.Among the batters Zimmermann retired were Bryce Harper, Jayson Werth and Anthony Rendon.You know some of these guys tendencies, Zimmermann said. Werth usually takes the first pitch, he said, so I threw it for a ball.Then he added: I threw a slider, and hes yelling at me out there, rounding first after he popped up. It was fun.Before Zimmermann took the mound, he caught up with Werth and Washington pitchers like Tanner Roark, Aaron Barrett, Gio Gonzalez and Stephen Strasburg.The Strasburg and Zimmermann families are very close, in part because both men have children who are the same age.It was strange, but it was good to see him, Strasburg said. I saw him in the weight room before the game. Hes doing well. He likes it over there, so Im happy for him.Despite Zimmermanns strong outing, the Nationals went on to win, 8-4.METS MOURN STAFF MEMBER The Mets clubhouse was somber Saturday morning after word came Friday night that Shannon Forde, a longtime member of the Mets media relations staff, had died of breast cancer. The Mets and the Yankees both had moments of silence in her memory before their spring-training games on Saturday.David Wright, the Mets captain, spoke about how Forde had helped him adjust to playing in the majors and how she had always treated his family like her own. He added that even as her illness was progressing, she was a presence during the Mets playoff run last year.She had such a hard time just walking around, doing daily things, but she tried to make all the trips during the playoffs, Wright said. She tried to make it to the stadium as much as she could. That says a lot about her and how much she loved this organization.The Mets also announced they would hold a memorial service for Forde at 3 p.m. Wednesday at Citi Field. TIM ROHANBRAVES LOSE RELIEVER Andrew McKirahan, a left-handed reliever for Atlanta, is most likely headed for another major elbow operation after sustaining an injury in his first appearance of spring training.Braves General Manager John Coppolella said McKirahan was expected to miss the season with a torn ulnar collateral ligament.McKirahan, 26, will seek a second opinion, but the Braves said they believed he would need Tommy John surgery, a procedure he already had in 2012.The injury occurred Wednesday on the fifth pitch of his spring debut against the Orioles.McKirahan missed 80 games last season after being suspended for testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs. He pitched in 27 games, going 1-0 with a 5.93 E.R.A.The Braves further pared down their pitching staff on Saturday by releasing two right-handers: Ryan Kelly, 28, who struggled during his time with the team last season, and David Carpenter, who was a key part of the Braves team that won the National League East in 2013, serving as the main setup man for Craig Kimbrel.Atlanta also reassigned five players to its minor league camp: outfielders Braxton Davidson and Matt Tuiasosopo, and catchers Matt Kennelly, Joe Odom and Braeden Schlehuber.

{"text": "I walked through the door of Vincent Valdezs studio, in a renovated firehouse near downtown San Antonio, the other day. I stopped dead, my eyes widened, my mouth made a silent O.I was looking at his latest painting, an unfinished oil on canvas that has already reached a monumental scale: over 6 feet high and 30 feet long, in four panels along two walls. But it wasnt the paintings size that made me stare and stare. It was the people in it, staring back.There are about 10 of them, wearing white, clustered as if for a group photo, which it seems you have just interrupted. They might be a family, but there is no way to tell. All you can see are their hands, and their eyes through the holes in their hoods.One holds a beer, one holds a baby, one checks his iPhone. One, with a womans hands, whispers to another. It is after dark. Dust swirls in the glowing headlights of a Chevy pickup, the main source of light other than a pinhole moon and the nighttime grid of a city in the distance.This painting  The City  places us on a bluff, somewhere in the present-day United States, in the company of the Klan.Mr. Valdez was not planning to be prophetic when he began the painting last November. He is not a polemical artist, or a literal-minded one, though his paintings are striking for their attention to emotion, storytelling and the revealing detail. He could not have known how much the Ku Klux Klan, and white supremacy, would overtake the 2016 presidential campaign.Since the night I first saw it, the image has haunted me, along with the thought that Mr. Valdez has captured, in a single composition, a selfie for 21st-century America. The grisaille painting  which he is rushing to finish for an opening on Sept. 9 at the David Shelton Gallery in Houston  is poetic realism, a fiction that tells the truth about the country today. Its a country obsessed with borders and boundaries, full of people who are comfortable but uneasy, clannish but frightened. People who are unaware, even in their robes, how ridiculous and terrifying they appear. Or who do not care.Mr. Valdez, a gentle 38-year-old with a ready laugh, grew up in San Antonio and studied at the Rhode Island School of Design. His subjects are often inspired by Mexican-American history. For a series called The Strangest Fruit, evoking the history of lynchings of Mexicans in the Southwest, he had subjects pose while suspended, briefly, by the neck  there was no other way to achieve the bulging distortions to eyes, neck and limbs. He did not paint the ropes; in the finished paintings, the young men, tattooed and in jeans and sneakers, seem to float, to fly, transformed.Mr. Valdez said The City is a homage to Philip Guston, the American artist who painted cartoonish, menacing Klanlike figures in the 1960s, and to the politically charged musician Gil Scott-Heron.Its almost too predictable, too easy, to portray these very menacing, overly aggressive, these guys who are snooping around, up to no good, Mr. Valdez said. I was much more curious about presenting them as, underneath those hoods, theyre everyday Americans, working jobs, picking up their kids from school, paying their taxes. Just hanging out, like most families would do on a Sunday.But once they put these masks on, he said, they completely change their persona, their vision. In this case they are strategizing, planning, plotting to continue to keep a stranglehold on the city.The painting leaves a lot of room for interpretation, he said. You get to decide what theyre plotting. Maybe theyre not plotting anything. Its the questions that intrigue him. What I love about the us and them is, whos the us and whos the them? Because it goes both ways here. You dont really know what it is theyre doing."}
{"text": "Every actor both craves and fears the role of a lifetime: that warm mantle of fame, fulfillment and maybe even financial security that like the red shoes of lore can never be completely removed. Rather than try, Joel Grey has chosen to burrow down into his R.O.A.L., examine every fiber  even though it was a leering creep, the rouged M.C. of the Kit Kat Klub in Hal Princes Cabaret and the utter antithesis of his own nice-guy persona.This unsavory character inspires his new memoirs title and its central conceit of a man keeping up appearances on the center stage known as life, performances humming along briskly even as chaos descends behind the scenes.Grey was born with a tube of greasepaint in his fist, to the boisterous family Katz of Cleveland. His mother, Grace, formerly Goldie Epstein, named him for her favorite movie star, Joel McCrea, and favored him over his younger brother, Ronnie. With unrealized ambitions to be an actress herself, she had married the Yiddish-inflected musician and comedian Mickey Katz, formerly Meir Myron Katz. Perhaps you remember the Borscht Capades?Glamorous but temperamental, the first of her relatives to get a nose job, Grace had a Joan Crawford streak, sometimes menacing her sons with a broom and once leaving young Joel alone in a New York hotel room while she went out dancing and drinking with a stranger. I always hated your mother, one of her four sisters, Fritzi, wheezes on her deathbed. She had gotten the nose job too. So did our hero. (And in what seems like a modern fairy-tale curse, eventually his daughter, Jennifer.)Small for his age and teased because Grace dressed him like a sissy, Joel found solace in the darkness of his fathers orchestra pit and then among the Curtain Pullers troupe at the Cleveland Play House. In the acting company, I found a family of an entirely different sort, he writes, in the noble tradition of children everywhere, reconstructing their damaged psyches in the theater. Here, you could say and feel whatever was inside you.Well, not quite everything. Young Joel had what in those days was a shameful secret: He was attracted to other boys. Furtive gropes ensued, with a teenage elevator operator, a cousin and  after the family follows Mickeys career to sybaritic Los Angeles  the cantor at a local synagogue. Rejected coldly by Grace after confessing this liaison, Joel hurls himself headlong into showbiz and begins constructing not so much a double life as a corrugated one, which included attraction to women, convention and the public approbation each conferred as well as the exciting, shameful lure of the hotel masseur and the gay bathhouse. The guy had more compartments than a Biedermeier secretary.He writes with rueful tenderness of his long marriage to the actress Jo Wilder, during which his attraction to men receded somewhat and he was a curiously domineering husband who told her what to wear, discouraged her career and suffered hot pangs of jealousy: I knew what happened in the theater, that very sexy place.There is industry gossip aplenty in Master of Ceremonies, including the travail of making Cabaret into a movie under the direction of Bob Fosse. Grey, who starred in and directed productions of Larry Kramers The Normal Heart, looks unsparingly at how AIDS devastated the theatrical community. Despite a side gig as an abstract photographer, though, he doesnt venture very far past the dress circle in this book. (Im still wondering what he and Truman Capote talked about that time they went to Harrys Bar in Venice.) He is simply smashing, though, on the role that made him whole.

{"text": "Would Britain be better off economically outside the European Union? The answer is most likely no, which is why Britons need to weigh the evidence carefully when they go to the polls in June to vote on leaving the E.U.Proponents of an exit criticize the union for taking too much power away from member nations and for issuing unnecessary and excessive regulations. This, the argument goes, has hurt Britains economy. But the data does not back that up. It is far from clear that leaving would lead to faster growth and better living standards. In fact, it could have the opposite effect.If E.U. regulations were as onerous as British critics say, those rules would hurt all 28 member countries. Yet the economies of other members like Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland have been more productive than Britain. Those countries had a gross domestic product per hour worked that was nearly the same as the United States in 2014, while Britains comparable figure was much lower, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.If Britain left the E.U. it would have to replace the unions rules with its own regulations in areas like the environment, banking and social services. It is improbable that when it came down to specific rules, the British public would want the risks that come with a more laissez-faire approach. In some areas like policies to reduce greenhouse gases, British regulations are already tougher than those of the E.U., according to an analysis by Open Europe, a London-based research group.Supporters of an exit argue that Britain would be able to maintain an open market with the union, its biggest trading partner. But that seems like wishful thinking. The E.U. would have no obligation to continue giving Britain tariff-free access to its market without securing big concessions in return. For example, Norway, which is not a member, pays the E.U. a fee and abides by most of its regulations to get access to its market.As far as trading with the rest of the world, Britain would most likely be worse off on its own. The European Union has trade agreements with countries that account for 60 percent of Britains trade, according to Open Europe. Britain would probably have to negotiate new pacts with those countries, and the terms would very likely be less favorable than those secured by the E.U. The union, after all, is the worlds largest economy with a G.D.P. of $18.5 trillion in 2014; Britains G.D.P. was $3 trillion. For the United States, which is negotiating a trade agreement with the E.U., a pact with Britain would no doubt be a lower priority.Investors are clearly worried about Britains economic prospects if it leaves, which is why the pound has depreciated against the dollar in recent months. One pound was $1.42 on Friday, down from $1.53 six months earlier. Global businesses with a big presence in Britain are particularly concerned. An exit could prompt  banks and large corporations to move parts of their operations from London to other European cities so they could continue doing business in E.U. countries without any disruptions.Supporters of an exit say British taxpayers would save about 10 billion pounds ($13.9 billion) a year if they no longer had to contribute to the E.U. budget. That is overstated, because Britain would have to spend more on the government functions that are now handled by the E.U. Besides, that sum amounts to just 1.3 percent of the governments total budgeted spending for its current fiscal year.Ultimately, separating from the union is highly unlikely to yield the economic bounty supporters have promised and it would leave Britain more isolated and probably poorer."}
{"text": "Mark Mattson, a neuroscientist at the National Institute on Aging in Maryland, has not had breakfast in 35 years. Most days he practices a form of fasting  skipping lunch, taking a midafternoon run, and then eating all of his daily calories (about 2,000) in a six-hour window starting in the afternoon.Once you get used to it, its not a big deal, said Dr. Mattson, chief of the institutes laboratory of neurosciences. Im not hungry at all in the morning, and this is other peoples experience as well. Its just a matter of getting adapted to it.In a culture in which its customary to eat three large meals a day while snacking from morning to midnight, the idea of regularly skipping meals may sound extreme. But in recent years intermittent fasting has been gaining popular attention and scientific endorsement.It has been promoted in best-selling books and endorsed by celebrities like the actors Hugh Jackman and Benedict Cumberbatch. The late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel claims that for the past two years he has followed an intermittent fasting program known as the 5:2 diet, which entails normal eating for five days and fasting for two  a practice Mr. Kimmel credits for his significant weight loss.Fasting to improve health dates back thousands of years, with Hippocrates and Plato among its earliest proponents. Dr. Mattson argues that humans are well suited for it: For much of human history, sporadic access to food was likely the norm, especially for hunter-gatherers. As a result, weve evolved with livers and muscles that store quickly accessible carbohydrates in the form of glycogen, and our fat tissue holds long-lasting energy reserves that can sustain the body for weeks when food is not available.From an evolutionary perspective, its pretty clear that our ancestors did not eat three meals a day plus snacks, Dr. Mattson said.Across the world, millions of people fast periodically for religious and spiritual reasons. But some are now looking at the practice as a source of health and longevity.Valter Longo, the director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California, initially studied fasting in mice that showed that two to five days of fasting each month reduced biomarkers for diabetes, cancer and heart disease. The research has since been expanded to people, and scientists saw a similar reduction in disease risk factors.Dr. Longo said the health benefits of fasting might result from the fact that fasting lowers insulin and another hormone called insulinlike growth factor, or IGF-1, which is linked to cancer and diabetes. Lowering these hormones may slow cell growth and development, which in turn helps slow the aging process and reduces risk factors for disease.When you have low insulin and low IGF-1, the body goes into a state of maintenance, a state of standby, Dr. Longo said. There is not a lot of push for cells to grow, and in general the cells enter a protected mode.Critics say that health benefits or not, various forms of intermittent fasting are too impractical for most people.The 5:2 diet, for example, advocates eating without restrictions for five days and then consuming just 500 calories  roughly the equivalent of a light meal  on each of the other two days of the week. Another regimen, called alternate-day fasting, involves eating no more than 500 calories every other day.A third regimen, which Dr. Mattson follows, is known as time-restricted feeding. The idea is to consume all of the days calories in a narrow window, typically six to eight hours, and fasting for the remaining 16 to 18 hours in a day. Studies of time-restricted feeding practices in both animals and humans have suggested that the practice may lower cancer risk and help people maintain their weight.The scientific community remains divided about the value of intermittent fasting. Critics say that the science is not yet strong enough to justify widespread recommendations for fasting as a way to lose weight or boost health, and that most of the evidence supporting it comes from animal research. Advocates say the body of research on intermittent fasting is growing rapidly and indicates that the health benefits are striking.The 5:2 diet, in particular, is backed by promising studies that show that it lowers weight and improves blood sugar, inflammation and other aspects of metabolic health, said Joy Dubost, a registered dietitian and a spokeswoman for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, the countrys largest organization of dietitians. She noted that fasting isnt appropriate for pregnant women, people with diabetes and people on medications.Most people who do this understand that its not about binge eating, Dr. Dubost said. But they like that it gives them the freedom not to worry about calories, carbs and other restrictions on days when theyre not fasting.Krista Varady, an associate professor of nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, has studied the effects of alternate-day fasting on hundreds of obese adults. In trials lasting eight to 10 weeks, she has found that people lose on average about 13 pounds and experience marked reductions in LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, triglycerides and insulin, the fat-storage hormone.Dr. Varady found in her research that intermittent fasting was easiest when people ate a moderately high-fat diet and were allowed to consume up to 500 calories on their fasting days. In her studies, 10 percent to 20 percent of people usually find the diet too difficult and quickly stop. Those who stick with it typically adjust after a rocky first few weeks.Weve run close to 700 people through various trials, Dr. Varady said. We thought people would overeat on their feast days to compensate. But people for some reason, regardless of their body weight, can only eat about 10 or 15 percent more than usual. They dont really overeat, and I think thats why this works.In 2011, Dr. Mattson and his colleagues reported a study of the 5:2 program that followed 107 overweight and obese women. Half of the subjects were assigned to eat no more than 500 calories each on two consecutive days each week. A control group was assigned to follow a low-calorie diet.After six months, both groups had lost weight. But the intermittent fasting group lost slightly more  about 14 pounds on average  and had greater reductions in belly fat. They also retained more muscle and had greater improvements in blood sugar regulation.Dr. Mattsons interest in intermittent fasting grew out of work on animals that showed that alternate-day fasting protected mice from strokes, Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease, and consistently extended their life spans by 30 percent. Dr. Mattson and his colleagues found that alternate-day fasting increased the production of proteins that protect brain cells, enhancing their ability to repair damaged DNA. Fasting, he said, acts as a mild stress that makes cells throughout the body stronger, shoring up their ability to adapt to later insults.In this way, intermittent fasting is like exercise, which causes immediate stress and inflammation, but protects against chronic disease in the long run. Eating fruits and vegetables may have a similar effect. While very large doses of antioxidants can cause cancer in humans, moderate amounts of exposure can make cells more resilient, Dr. Mattson said.There is overlap between the way cells respond to exercise, to fasting, and even to exposure to some of the chemicals in fruits and vegetables, he added.Dr. Mattson is now starting a rigorous clinical trial of people 55 to 70 years old who are prediabetic and at high risk for developing Alzheimers disease. He plans to study whether intermittent fasting may slow cognitive decline.Dr. David Ludwig, a professor of nutrition at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, said one benefit of fasting is that it forces the body to shift from using glucose for fuel to using fat. During this process, the fat is converted to compounds known as ketones, a clean energy source that burns more efficiently than glucose, like high-octane gasoline, Dr. Ludwig said.The same process, known as ketosis, occurs when people go on extremely low-carb, high-fat diets. Dr. Ludwig said ketones seem to have unique effects on the brain. High-fat diets, for example, have been used for years to treat people who suffer from epileptic seizures.There are extensive reports of children who had debilitating seizures who were cured on ketogenic diets, Dr. Ludwig said. If it benefits the brain to prevent seizures, then maybe it benefits the brain in other ways.Dr. Ludwig noted that the long-term effectiveness of fasting had not been well studied. He cautioned that for many people, fasting is simply too difficult and may slow metabolism. A potentially more practical approach is to limit sugar and other processed carbohydrates, replacing them with natural fats, protein and unrefined carbohydrates, he said.It takes a very disciplined person to skip a couple meals every day, he added.But Dr. Mattson, who has been skipping meals for decades, said the adjustment to skipping breakfast and lunch was a lot like the change that occurs when a couch potato starts exercising.If youve been sedentary for years and then you go out and try to run five miles, youre not going to feel very good until you get in shape, he said.

{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  Amazon Web Services, a globe-spanning cloud computing network that is part of the online retailing giant Amazon, has rapidly become one of the most powerful forces in technology. It has also become a target for poachers.Last October, at a conference in Las Vegas with thousands of corporate executives and software developers in attendance, A.W.S.s chief, Andy Jassy, strode before an intentionally poorly disguised image of Lawrence J. Ellison, founder and chairman of the Oracle Corporation. Foot-tall words like bullies, extorted and strong arm appeared next to Mr. Jassy and the image of Ellision. The logo of Oracle, one of the biggest companies in Silicon Valley, was barely crossed out.Our marketing team needs work on redaction, Mr. Jassy joked.Better cloaked was the reason for his enmity: Oracle had been slow to get into the cloud business, but recently made multiple hiring raids on A.W.S. Both Oracle and Amazon declined to comment on Mr. Jassys dig.The hunt for the hard-to-find talent that can build and run the massive data centers behind cloud computing is pitting three generations of companies against one another. Old-guard companies like Oracle, techs current giants like Amazon and its peers, as well as Bay Area start-ups are offering big salaries and big perks for cloud computing experts.On the social media site LinkedIn, for example, there are over 130 engineering positions available at Oracle Seattle. Many of them are the kind of jobs that now pay $300,000 to $1 million a year, according to Shannon Anderson, who has been recruiting engineers in Seattle and the Bay Area for 25 years.Seattle and its surrounding towns are a hot spot for this kind of tech talent because they are home to A.W.S., which runs the biggest cloud computing service, and Microsoft, which has a large cloud business called Azure. Google also has a cloud computing office in the area. So does Facebook.Someone working deep inside Amazon is getting five to 20 recruiting offers a day, Ms. Anderson said. Compensation has doubled in five years. For a recruiter, who is typically paid a percentage of a star engineers compensation, this is a very good time, she said.Cloud computing, which powers an increasing number of our devices and services, allows a vast collection of computers  often spread around the world  to operate like one giant machine.These computing clouds are being filled with once unimaginable amounts of data from apps, websites and sensors on all sorts of things. Fast-growing online services like Snapchat run on cloud systems. Apple has its own cloud, as does Facebook. Cloud systems even offer the computing muscle needed for things like artificial intelligence.As other tech sectors show signs of slowing, cloud services have created unprecedented demand for highly educated engineers and mathematicians who can build and operate these flywheels of data. Instead of asking about the latest computer coding languages or how to make a web page load faster, the most important question in tech hiring has become: Can you handle petabytes? That is the data in about 13 billion images, or roughly the amount of printed information that would fit in 20 million file cabinets.In the Bay Area, $125,000 a year is not an uncommon salary for someone newly out of graduate school with the expertise to do cloud computing work. With five years of experience, $300,000 along with a range of stock or job opportunities that greatly inflate the value of those paychecks have become the norm.Its an aggressive market, said Corey Sanders, director of program management at Microsoft Azure. We are all data engineers now, and we can convince people that this is the best place to learn that.The ability to deal with so much data has also become important to industrial companies like General Electric in figuring out things like jet engine maintenance schedules. G.E.s pitch to cloud computing experts: We offer a chance to rebuild the industrial world.In the last three years, G.E. has hired 1,500 software developers and systems engineers, and trained a similar number of existing employees to work on cloud systems connected to everything from smartphones to wind turbines and jet engines.Weve hired from every large company, places like Amazon and Google, as well as start-ups, or out of schools, said William Ruh, the head of G.E.s cloud business. We pay well, with attractive benefits, a life and a chance to work on the mission to remake American industry.Still, he said, Im totally shocked at how fast compensation is moving up.For smaller companies, the gold rush is more complicated. In San Franciscos South Park neighborhood, Tom Chavez runs a company called Krux that scans data from more than three billion devices, creating a trove of seven petabytes of information retrieved by several hundred companies. Many of his 160 or so employees are just the kind of people the giants, along with other start-ups, are looking for.LinkedIn or Facebook can offer an engineer with a few years experience a package close to $1 million, said Mr. Chavez, who co-founded Krux and is its chief executive. We wanted someone out of Stanford for an internship, and Google offered her an annualized $180,000 for the summer, or about $45,000 for three months.Facebook also wants employees like the people Mr. Chavez has hired. In fact, Vivek Vaidya, a Krux co-founder, calls the steep salaries Krux is compelled to pay our Facebook tax.Krux takes up several floors of a brick building at the base of South Park, a onetime place of sweatshops that has filled with start-ups and venture capitalists.On the ground floor, development engineers get daily calls asking if they want to jump ship. A nearby team of data scientists gets 20 or more unsolicited emails a week via LinkedIn. Upstairs, Kruxs recruiter strives to keep people, even as he looks to take from others.I cant compete with a $50,000 signing bonus from Google, so I focus on the person, what really motivates them, said Cade Garrett, who has recruited about 100 people to Krux.Besides offering stock options that could be valuable if the company has initial public offering, a fast-growing start-up can offer younger engineers a crash course in technology  the kind of training that could one day allow them to start their own companies.I tell them this isnt the best-paying job, but they have to think about where things are going: Everything they do here is mission critical, Mr. Garrett said. You go to Google, you cant be sure that in a couple of years youll have a product to show.Mr. Chavez thinks industry titans like Larry Page, the chief executive of the Alphabet holding company that includes Google, are intentionally driving up salaries. If I was Larry, Id do the same thing: throw a few more million at people and cut off everyone elses oxygen.Even so, Mr. Garrett tries to keep engineers contact information off the Krux websites to foil recruiters. And he is more than happy to do his own poaching. Zenefits, a fast-growing online employee-benefits company currently reeling from the departure of its founding chief and a round of layoffs, is a target.Absolutely, Ill call into any company that is in trouble, he said."}
{"text": "LAS VEGAS  At some point, most young basketball players come to realize that success is measured by more than what prestigious conference they play in or what big-time program they suit up for. There is a lot to be said for happiness.Ask Joe Rahon.A 6-foot-2 junior guard, he had 10 points, 10 rebounds and 4 assists on Saturday night as St. Marys defeated Loyola Marymount here in the quarterfinals of the West Coast Conferences tournament.Coming out of high school in San Diego, Rahon envisioned having that kind of performance at the Atlantic Coast Conference tournament, before a huge, rabid crowd. It was a dream that prompted Rahon to fly across the country to play under Steve Donahue at Boston College.Its a miscalculation made each year by nave 18-year-old recruits, attracted by the image of the big conferences, with their glamorous head coaches and phenomenal facilities.I was going to be a building block of the program, Rahon said Saturday, recalling that he had looked forward to playing at Duke, at North Carolina, against Syracuse at the Carrier Dome.After two years at Boston College, though, Rahon had had enough  enough of the losing, enough of the futility. In his sophomore season, 2013-14, Boston College finished 8-24, its worst record since joining the A.C.C. in 2005.Donahue was fired with two years left on his contract.After two years, the competitor in me was saying, This is really cool, but I want to win, Rahon said.He headed to St. Marys and sat out the 2014-2015 season because of the N.C.A.A.s transfer rules, an agonizing exercise but one that enabled Rahon time to acclimate to the West Coast and adjust to his new situation.There would be trade-offs.Youre playing smaller gyms, fewer people in the crowd, Rahon said, but when youre playing for a championship and youre playing games that are really meaningful, into late February and early March, it kind of makes up for the big arenas and atmosphere that you get in the A.C.C.I enjoy the midmajor conference tournaments, including the W.C.C.s. They are defined by a sense of hope that gives March Madness its high-wire excitement.In recent years, though, income inequality in sports  supposedly the epitome of a level playing field  has become discouraging. Again and again, with a few exceptions, the hope that the conference tournaments inevitably engender has met a swift end in the N.C.A.A. tournament.I have become obsessed with the idea of creating March Madness parity to consistently allow the great midmajor basketball teams in any given year to reach the N.C.A.A. tournaments Final Four. I envision parallel tournaments, one made up of midmajors and one of programs from the so-called Power Five conferences. The top two teams in each tournament would meet in a reconfigured Final Four.I shared my vision with the W.C.C.s commissioner, Lynn Holzman, who knows, as I do, that such an arrangement is impossible but also knows that there must be a change in the landscape.Still, for all of the inequities of the current system, Holzman likes the long-shot nature of the N.C.A.A. tournament, which makes midmajors perennial underdogs.I still think there is something magical about the field of 68 and playing in the N.C.A.A. championship, she said. Were obsessed with the Cinderella story and the possibility that the 16th seed is going to beat the No. 1 seed.Provided they avoid upsets on Monday, St. Marys and Gonzaga will play on Tuesday for the W.C.C. tournament title. Each team appears to be on the bubble for making the N.C.A.A. tournament and may need the conferences automatic bid to prolong its season. Gonzaga has the added pressure of trying to extend its streak of consecutive N.C.A.A. tournament appearances to 18.Regardless of which team moves on, though, it will be an underdog once the N.C.A.A. tournament begins next week.Some might say that Gonzaga is no longer a Cinderella story, but I think it still is, Holzman said. When you look at how many midmajors actually get to the Final Four, its rare.David Carter, a St. Marys assistant and a former head coach at Nevada, was on the 1988-89 St. Marys team that reached the N.C.A.A. tournament but lost to Clemson in its opener. For Carter, the difference between that year and this one is exposure. In 1989, there was little opportunity for fans across the country to be exposed to conferences like the W.C.C.You were more amped up to see what you could do, Carter said of playing as a midmajor in the national tournament. It was more of a David-and-Goliath approach to the tournament because people across the county never saw you play.Today, programs at every level get exposure. Even high school teams get exposure.Youre on television quite a bit, Carter said. You have parity in basketball. Teams in the West Coast Conference feel they can play against anyone in the country.Carter said that in his playing days, players at midmajors who did not have much experience against the nations top teams always had doubts. You werent sure if youre good enough, Carter said, describing their attitude as lets go prove ourselves.But now, Carter added, I think people see you, see your team and see how good you are, so its not a big surprise when you beat a team from a big-five conference.The Power Five conferences still attract the top players, and recruits like Rahon will invariably pick one of those teams over a midmajor.Many, though, will eventually transfer.At that point, its no longer about getting to the N.B.A. but about enjoying the experience  winning a regular-season title or a conference tournament championship and taking your shot in the N.C.A.A. tournament. Its about feeling productive.I wanted to win, Rahon said. I wanted a chance to make the tournament, a chance to play for a league championship. Everything I came here for is kind of coming to fruition.I have watched hundreds of young talented players spend a lifetime pursuing manufactured goals. The luckiest among them realize, as Rahon has, that success is not always measured by the destination but by the quality of the journey."}
{"text": "CAIRO   Egypt said Sunday that members of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, trained by the Palestinian militant group Hamas, carried out the bombing in Cairo that killed Egypts top prosecutor last summer.Egypts interior minister, Maj. Gen. Magdi Abdel-Ghaffar, described at a news conference a plot to kill the prosecutor, Hisham Barakat, that he linked to exiled Muslim Brotherhood leaders in Turkey and a Hamas training camp in the Gaza Strip.Hamas denied the charges on Sunday. In June, at the time of the bombing, the Muslim Brotherhood denied any involvement in the killing of the prosecutor.These statements are untrue and do not bode well for ongoing efforts to develop ties between Hamas and Cairo, Samy Abu Zahri, a Hamas spokesman, said in a statement.Mr. Barakat, who spearheaded the prosecution and mass trials of thousands of Islamists, was killed when a car bomb containing more than 175 pounds of explosives was detonated as his vehicle drove through a Cairo suburb on June 29.Mr. Barakat was the most senior official to be killed in Egypt in 25 years. The assassination prompted President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi to introduce an antiterrorism law that expanded the powers of Egypts security forces and restricted civil liberties.The killing was part of a wave of attacks against government officials and the security forces that followed the militarys ouster of the Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, in 2013.After the removal of Mr. Morsi, the government outlawed the Muslim Brotherhood, killed hundreds of its supporters at a demonstration in Cairo and jailed thousands more. Many Muslim Brotherhood leaders fled into exile in Turkey.On Sunday, General Abdel-Ghaffar, the interior minister, said the authorities had arrested 48 Muslim Brotherhood supporters across Egypt in connection with various plots to attack government targets, including 14 suspected of being involved in the assassination of Mr. Barakat.General Abdel-Ghaffar accused Yahia Moussa, a Health Ministry spokesman under Mr. Morsi, of coordinating the attack from Turkey, and said the suspects had received military and explosives training at a Hamas-run camp in the Gaza Strip.The men were sent back into Egypt with the help of Bedouin smugglers in the Sinai Peninsula and communicated with their handlers using the Internet, General Abdel-Ghaffar said."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   The Obama administration, responding to consumer complaints, says it will begin rating health insurance plans based on how many doctors and hospitals they include in their networks.At the same time, the maximum out-of-pocket costs for consumers under the Affordable Care Act will increase next year to $7,150 for an individual and $14,300 for a family, the administration said. Consumer advocates said those costs could be a significant burden for middle-income people who need a substantial amount of care.Under new rules to be published Tuesday in the Federal Register, insurers will still be allowed to sell health plans with narrow networks of providers. But consumers will know in advance what they are getting because the government will attach a label indicating the breadth of the network for each plan sold on HealthCare.gov.About 12.7 million people signed up or had their coverage automatically renewed in the third annual open enrollment season, which ended on Jan. 31.Many health plans offered in the public marketplaces provide a limited choice of doctors and hospitals, and some insurers narrowed their networks this year by excluding some doctors and dropping popular teaching hospitals.Consumers have grumbled about the changes, and some say they have had difficulty finding medical specialists. But cost-conscious consumers have gravitated to these plans because they tend to offer lower premiums than health plans providing a greater choice of doctors and hospitals.Consumers can already find out which health plans include a specific doctor. But until now they had no reliable way to determine if a health plan had a large or small network of providers. The new ratings will indicate how the breadth of a health plans network compares with that of other plans in the same geographic area.This could be really helpful for a lot of consumers, said Sabrina Corlette, a consumer advocate and professor at the Health Policy Institute of Georgetown University.Consumers have also complained about the out-of-pocket costs for many health plans under the Affordable Care Act.For many people, $7,000 of costs can be a huge impediment to actually receiving care, especially if patients incur those costs in a month or two at the start of a year, said Marc M. Boutin, the chief executive of the National Health Council, a coalition of advocacy groups for people with chronic diseases.Out-of-pocket costs, as defined by the government, include deductibles and co-payments, but not the premiums that people pay for insurance. Each insurer sets limits on out-of-pocket costs for its health plans, and the limit cannot be higher than the maximum specified by the government. The maximum for an individual will exceed $7,000 next year for the first time. It will go up by $300 in 2017, after an increase of $250 this year.Consumer groups say this rate of increase is unsustainable. Moreover, they say, high out-of-pocket costs have deterred some people with insurance from using expensive prescription drugs.Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said that in setting the new ceiling on out-of-pocket costs, the administration had used a formula laid out in the Affordable Care Act. Before the law was adopted, he said, people with cancer or other serious illnesses could be bankrupted by hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills, and the law provides new protections.People with low incomes can obtain discounts that reduce their deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs if they choose midlevel silver plans. Slightly more than half of the people with marketplace coverage received such cost-sharing reductions last year.Ms. Corlette, the Georgetown University professor, said that in writing the new rules, the administration was walking a very delicate line, pushing forward with consumer protections while trying to keep insurers onboard and participating in the marketplaces.In some markets, consumers can choose from dozens of health plans. In a move intended to simplify the shopping experience, the Obama administration has devised six model health plans that it describes as standardized options. Federal officials specify the amount of deductibles, co-payments and other charges for doctors services, hospital care, X-rays, laboratory tests and prescription drugs.The standard features will make it easier for consumers to compare plans, officials said, and the government will highlight these plans in some way on HealthCare.gov. But the government is not requiring insurers to offer the standardized options or limiting their ability to offer other plans in 2017.Another new requirement is meant to guarantee continuity of care for certain patients. If a health plan drops a doctor from its network without cause, the insurer must allow patients in an active course of treatment to continue seeing the doctor for up to 90 days. This protection would apply, for example, to patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy for cancer and to women in the second or third trimester of pregnancy.Under the new rules, consumers using the federal marketplace will be able to get help year-round from insurance counselors financed by the government. The counselors, known as navigators, help people sign up in the annual open enrollment period. The administration is expanding their duties to include teaching people how to use insurance, appeal denials of coverage and obtain exemptions."}
{"text": "Many people long to live near water for the pleasures of swimming, boating, fishing, or just to contemplate.But, says Manu Prakash, a scientist at Stanford with broad interests, the surface of an alluring lake or pond, the boundary where water meets air , can be far less inviting for certain insects.Water is about 100 times as viscous as air, and insects that live on its surface must somehow negotiate movement in both realms. Most seem to choose one or the other. Some, like long-legged water striders, maintain a small measure of distance from the water with a cushion of air that lets them skate on the surface. Others, like whirligig beetles, embrace the water and swim.The lily pad beetle, which Dr. Prakash and his colleagues report on in The Journal of Experimental Biology, has evolved a unique solution to moving in water and air at the same time.It flies, beating its wings for propulsion much as it would if it were taking off into the air. But it remains tethered to the water by claws at the end of its legs that break through the surface and act as anchors so a strong wing beat wont unexpectedly lift the beetle.The movement is unusual, a bit like windsurfing, except that rather than having a sail to catch the wind, the beetle uses its wings to generate power.Dr. Prakash runs a laboratory devoted to projects as varied as economical paper microscopes, water computers and biophysics. He conducted the study of the lily pad beetle with Haripriya Mukundarajan and Dong Hyun Kim at Stanford and Thibaut C. Bardon of the cole Polytechnique in Paris. He described the research as just good old natural history, with a large dose of physics.It began some years ago when he saw, on a pond, something that moved so fast that I couldnt actually see it. He stayed for a couple of hours trying to track the culprit down and finally found the beetle, which eats holes in lily pads and zips from one to the other on the waters surface.He thought its technique was a great way to move around and had a hunch that the physics would be intriguing. And he was attracted, he said, to a creature that had really claimed this harsh environment.With high speed video and mathematical analysis of the movements and forces involved, the team made several discoveries.The beetles legs repel water, which keeps it afloat, except for claws at their tips, which penetrate the surface of the water and tie it to the surface.As the beetle flies, or surfs, the up and down force of its wings and the attachment of the claws make the surface of the water bounce up and down like a trampoline. The tips of the wings almost touch the surface of the water, and the beetle copes with aerodynamics, surface tension and another kind of drag that appears only when the insect is moving faster than about nine inches a second. The beetle actually travels close to a foot a second. Its called capillary wave drag.The whole system, Dr. Prakash said, is right at the edge of chaos, mathematically speaking. A chaotic system is one so complicated that given the initial conditions, one cant predict what is going to happen. One way or another, the beetle manages to navigate this environment.The self-powered surfing actually demands more energy than fully airborne flight, which the beetle can also do. It seems to prefer this sort of locomotion. Dr. Prakash said that may be because its a good way to find new food sources, or because predators havent figured it out.He said that he and his colleagues were now turning to a fly that seemed to do something similar but in the sea. There are, of course, ways that one could imagine applying the findings to robotics, but the research really was done, he said, for pure scientific curiosity.One thing the remarkable beetle did not evolve is a braking system. In the lab, it runs into the edge of a dish and just topples over. On a pond, Dr. Prakash said, they seem to stop the same way.They hit the leaf, he said."}
{"text": "Downtime for N.B.A. players is a study in relaxation techniques. After a practice or before a game, many indulge in video games, a movie, a book or the ever-popular nap. A day off might include all of the above.But Pat Connaughton, a rookie with the Portland Trail Blazers, has a method all his own. On a nice day, he slips on a baseball glove, goes outdoors and plays catch with his father.It is no ordinary catch, though, and it is not solely for relaxation or familial bonding. Connaughton, a lithe 6-foot-6 shooting guard with a smooth jump shot and a rocket arm, throws with a purpose.He might go to a remote park around Portland, Ore., with his father, Len Connaughton, a real estate manager. Pat Connaughton loosens up from a close distance for a while, then throws 120 feet on a line and then moves in to 60 feet, firing 90-mile-per-hour lasers that slice through the air.Some guys take naps, Connaughton said last week before a game against the Knicks. As busy as we are and as focused as we are at our sport, there are times the coaches want you to get away from basketball. If my dads not around, then Ill go out and throw against a fence.Connaughton, a gregarious 23-year-old with high aspirations, is not throwing only for recreation, though. He is like any pitcher readying himself to enter a game  the only difference is that the game is two, three, maybe 10 years away.Even if I have a successful and plentiful N.B.A. career, he said, someday I am going to go back and try to be a big league pitcher.Later Tuesday night against the Knicks, Connaughton briefly played for the first time in six games. The next night, in a game in his hometown, Boston, he had 7 points while playing 7 minutes 45 seconds, each figure a career high.Connaughton does not play much. Few second-round draft picks do. For many observers, including the hopeful Baltimore Orioles, baseball is Connaughtons better sport.He has the talent to be a top-of-the-rotation guy, Rick Peterson, the Orioles pitching coordinator, said in Sarasota, Fla., on Friday. He has a major league arm, but just as important, he is a major league person, and that is a prerequisite. He has everything it takes.Peterson helped usher in a golden pitching era in Oakland with Tim Hudson, Mark Mulder and Barry Zito. He also worked closely with Pedro Martinez and Tom Glavine with the Mets. But when he watched Connaughton throw a bullpen session in Sarasota in summer 2014, he witnessed something he had never quite seen before.His fastball looked like no other fastball, Peterson said. It has the most unique late movement Ive ever seen.That bullpen session was shortly after the Orioles had drafted Connaughton in the fourth round of the Major League Baseball amateur draft. That summer, in six games during a brief turn with the Class A Aberdeen IronBirds, Connaughton had an eye-opening 2.45 E.R.A. over 142/3 innings. Then he was off to Italy on a trip with the Notre Dame basketball team, followed by his senior year with the Fighting Irish.Connaughton played both baseball and basketball at Notre Dame, but after graduation, he told the Orioles that basketball was his preference. He adores the sport, and he had to see if he could make it.Contrary to many predictions, he was drafted  41st over all by the Nets. He was immediately traded to the Trail Blazers, whose general manager, Neil Olshey, is considered a top talent evaluator.In order to sign his rookie contract, Connaughton had to give up professional baseball for at least two years, although he said Portland was fine with his light throwing program. After two years, the Blazers say, Connaughton can petition to have that condition reconsidered.That is why he continues to play catch. Peterson and Chris Correnti, an Orioles trainer who has worked closely with Martinez and Johan Santana, gave Connaughton the Orioles standard off-season throwing program to follow in his free time. Connaughton also stretches out his arm every night to help keep it in shape.I understand assets, he said. My arm is an asset, and I need to take care of it.Connaughton relishes a challenge, especially overcoming doubters who said he would never be drafted in the N.B.A., that Notre Dames 2-point loss to Kentucky in the Midwest Regional final of last years N.C.A.A. tournament was his basketball peak.It very well may not be. But to date, Connaughtons N.B.A. journey has been unsurprising for a second-round pick. He gets most of his playing time in practice as a member of the scout team.In real games, he is averaging 3.0 minutes and 0.8 of a point. He has played in only 25 of the Blazers 64 games. Yet even that is more than most expected.No one thought I would be here, he said. You see people say: He should go back to baseball. He should do this; he should do that. Those are people who said I would never even make it here. Theres always another hurdle to go over, and its fun to use that as motivation.If he develops into a solid N.B.A. player, Connaughton could gain the leverage needed to play both sports professionally, the way Chuck Connors, Dave DeBusschere and Danny Ainge once did.Connaughton is no longer an Orioles employee, but the team retains his rights in case he returns to baseball. So when Connaughton heard that a reporter was soon headed to Orioles camp in Florida, he smiled.Tell them I said hello, he said with a playful wink, and Ill see them shortly."}
{"text": "Sometimes its hard to shake the uneasy feeling that we are witnessing the dissolution of an idea that was once America.The country is still a military superpower and an economic and innovation powerhouse, but so many of our institutions are proving to be either fundamentally flawed or deeply broken.This thought kept creeping into my mind as I watched Thursdays Republican presidential debate in Detroit. It seemed to me the zenith of a carnival of absurdity, as the candidates descended into what appeared to be a penis measuring contest.I kept thinking with dread, One of these men might actually be the next president  either the demagogue from New York, the political arsonist from Texas or the empty suit from Florida. (I see no path for the governor from Ohio.)In another political season, liberals might greet such a prospect with glee. But this is not that season.On the Democratic side, the leading candidate is a hawkish political shape shifter, too cozy with big money, whose use of a private email server has led to an F.B.I. investigation, and who most Americans dont trust.(Around two-thirds of Americans dont trust either partys front-runner.)Her lone opponent is a self-described democratic socialist who seeks to cram sweeping generational changes  hinged on massive systemic disruptions and significant tax hikes  into a presidential term. And he says that he will be able to do this with the help of a political revolution, one that has yet to materialize at the polls.One of these people will be the next president of the United States.And this is the country of which they will take the helm:We are a country stuck in perpetual warfare that is now confronting the threat of the Islamic State terrorist group. The Republican candidates have proposed the most outlandish approaches to that threat, including everything from war crimes such as torture and killing terror suspects families to carpet bombing in the Middle East until we can see whether sand can glow in the dark.Our government is broken. We have a legislative branch that increasingly sees its role as resistance rather than action. There is an opening on the Supreme Court that Republican leaders in the Senate, in a breathtaking and unprecedented move, are saying they wont let this duly elected president fill.The appointment may fall to the next president.But that same Supreme Court has ruled that money is speech, swinging the door wide open to allow to the ultrawealthy to have nearly unlimited influence on the electoral process.No wonder a 2014 study found that America has effectively transformed into an oligarchy instead of a democracy.And yet, that is an idea that most Americans are pathologically incapable of processing. We suffer from a blithe glacialism, occasionally cursing the winds that carry our demise, but mostly hoping against hope and pretending that evidence of things seen and felt is either faulty or fleeting. It is not.We have millions of undocumented immigrants in this country, but comprehensive immigration reform remains a thing we bicker about but never move on.Our infrastructure is in shambles, but in a country where the bridges are crumbling, Republican candidates are obsessed about building a border wall. The city of Flint was poisoned as officials sought to pinch pennies.Global warming continues unabated, most likely intensifying the severity of extreme weather  from droughts to hurricanes to blizzards  and yet last month the Supreme Court temporarily blocked the Obama administrations rules to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.Our educational system, from pre-K to college, serves the wealthy relatively well, but leaves far too many without access, underprepared or drowning in debt.We are plagued by gun violence and mass shootings and yet no one is moving forward on meaningful solutions.Americas middle class is shrinking. According to a December Pew Research Center report: Fully 49 percent of U.S. aggregate income went to upper-income households in 2014, up from 29 percent in 1970. The share accruing to middle-income households was 43 percent in 2014, down substantially from 62 percent in 1970.Our criminal justice system has made a mockery of the concept of equal justice with its racially skewed pattern of mass incarceration. Not only is the United States the worlds leader in incarceration with 2.2 million people currently in the nations prisons or jails  a 500 percent increase over the past thirty years, according to the Sentencing Project, but the group also points out:More than 60 percent of the people in prison are now racial and ethnic minorities. For black males in their thirties, 1 in every 10 is in prison or jail on any given day. These trends have been intensified by the disproportionate impact of the war on drugs, in which two-thirds of all persons in prison for drug offenses are people of color.The list of woe is a mile long.There is palpable discontent in this country among those who feel left out and left behind in the bounty of Americas prosperity.How long can the center hold? How long can the illusion be sustained? How long before we start to call this the post-American idealism era?"}

{"text": "JERUSALEM   A new plan on how to divide Jerusalems Jewish and Arab neighborhoods has had the peculiar distinction of uniting people against it.The contentious plan, promoted by a group of liberal Israeli Jews and adopted in principle by the center-left Labor Party, would unilaterally fence off most of East Jerusalems Palestinian neighborhoods and transfer responsibility for their 200,000 residents from City Hall to the Palestinian Authority and the Israeli military in the occupied West Bank.Kicked off with advertisements under the heading Saving Jewish Jerusalem, the campaigns almost jingoistic tone seems intended to appeal to the broadest Jewish constituency, including Israels growing political center and conservative nationalist camp.Instead, it has been rejected at both ends of the political spectrum, as well as by Palestinian leaders.The new campaign describes Jerusalems Palestinian residents as imperiling the security, demographic balance, standard of living and economy of the city. It argues that a majority of people 18 and under in the city are Palestinian and plays on fears raised by the recent surge of Palestinian attacks against Israeli Jews.Ir Amim, a leftist group that advocates a status for Jerusalem as a dual capital of Israel and of a future Palestine, said the proposal was detached from any understanding of the fabric of daily life in Jerusalem. Without agreement from the Palestinian leadership, the group added, such a move would lead to political, urban and humanitarian chaos.Moshe Arens, a former minister from the conservative Likud Party, wrote in a recent column that any such split has become essentially impossible and that stripping East Jerusalem Arabs of their Israeli residency permits would be legally questionable and morally reprehensible. Saeb Erekat, the secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization, called the proposal racist.Thousands of Jerusalemites will be separated from their schools, hospitals, religious sites and also their properties, he said. This plan clearly shows that even members of the so-called progressive Israeli camp are falling into the same policies of the Israeli right.Dividing Jerusalem, with sacred Jewish, Muslim and Christian sites at its core, has long been one of the most emotional and intractable issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Israel conquered Jerusalems Old City and its environs, along with the West Bank, from Jordan in the 1967 war. Then it expanded the city limits, taking in 28 West Bank villages on the high ground surrounding the city, and annexed the territory in a move that was never internationally recognized. Ever since, its leaders have claimed sovereignty over what they deem Israels united capital.But the Palestinians demand East Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent state. They and much of the world see the developments that Israel has built in the annexed area since 1967, now home to some 200,000 Jews, as illegal settlements. These would remain within Israeli Jerusalem under the plan.The vast majority of the citys 300,000 Arab residents  about a third of Jerusalems population  chose not to apply for Israeli citizenship, but hold permanent residency status that entitles them to social benefits and to work and move freely throughout Israel.International road maps for peace have long imagined Palestinian control of Jerusalems Arab areas and Israeli control of Jewish ones, with a special arrangement for the Old City and its surroundings. But this latest plan  which would remove about two-thirds of Jerusalems Arab residents by disconnecting populous outer neighborhoods like Beit Hanina, Sur Baher and Issawiya from the city  comes in the absence of peace talks and amid months of rising violence.We have to open a public debate and a parliamentary debate: What is it we want to keep? said Shaul Arieli, a map specialist who took part in past peace talks and helped formulate the plan. Advancing a unilateral plan for Jerusalem as an interim measure, in the absence of talks for a permanent deal, he said, shows the Israelis that nothing is holy.Mr. Arieli, a reserve colonel in the Israeli Army who participated in the 2000 Camp David negotiations, is among more than 30 Israeli public figures  veterans of the political, diplomatic and security establishments  who signed the campaign ads.Haim Ramon, a former minister from Labor and the centrist Kadima Party who is the architect of the new plan, said that if the Arab residents ended their boycott of city elections, the next mayor of Jerusalem would not be Jewish. If the Palestinians were clever, they would decide, instead of the knife, to use the vote, he told reporters. You cannot have a strategy that your enemy will be stupid forever.The long impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process has given impetus to various Israeli proposals for unilateralism, usually involving withdrawal from part of the West Bank.Such plans, calling for Israel to control its own destiny by defining its borders, aim to satisfy a majority of Israeli Jews, who want some kind of partition but do not believe that a full peace deal is attainable at present. They imagine that removing some settlements and reducing the amount of West Bank territory under occupation could take some international pressure off Israel.But Mr. Ramons idea of shedding parts of East Jerusalem is causing confusion, even among supporters of other unilateral initiatives meant to hasten the two-state solution.Demographically, its a compelling argument, said Michael Oren, a center-right member of Parliament who has proposed his own interim measures involving withdrawal from some settlements. Israel has a strategic interest in maintaining a Jewish majority in the capital of the Jewish state.But, Mr. Oren added, keep in mind that redefining who is a Jerusalemite is not the only way of addressing that. Instead, he suggested, a government push to create jobs and lower municipal taxes could encourage more Israeli Jews to move to Jerusalem.The Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem generally have a higher standard of living than those in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. But about three-quarters of Arab families in Jerusalem are below Israels poverty line, compared with about 21 percent of the citys Jewish families.Many of the Arab residents complain of years of neglect by both City Hall and the Palestinian Authority, which is headquartered in the West Bank and is barred from operating in Jerusalem. Unilaterally disenfranchising the Palestinian residents would require a majority vote of the Israeli Parliament to amend the basic law governing Israels hold over the city.For the Israeli right, Jerusalem has long posed a conundrum, pitting security and demographic concerns against ideology.When a wave of Palestinian stabbings began in October, the government erected concrete barriers between some Jewish and Arab parts of East Jerusalem to improve security. But after several right-wing ministers complained that the roadblocks suggested the united capital could be divided, just as the Palestinian leadership had been advocating for years, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly ordered them removed.Mr. Netanyahu and Nir Barkat, Jerusalems mayor, argue that Israeli sovereignty guarantees the Arab residents a quality of life superior to that of Israels Arab neighbors. Naftali Bennett, the right-wing education minister, has declared the next school year the year of united Jerusalem to mark the 50th anniversary of the reunification of the city in 1967.Part of Mr. Bennetts plan is to increase school trips to Jerusalem from across the country. Proponents of the Saving Jewish Jerusalem campaign noted wryly that the schoolchildren were unlikely to be taken to Sur Baher or Issawiya, where few Israeli Jews dare venture these days. As Mr. Ramon put it, Nobody would think to go to these places."}

{"text": "Agents for running back DeMarco Murray confirm that Murray, the N.F.L.s 2014 rushing leader, has been traded by the Philadelphia Eagles to the Tennessee Titans.Murray also has a new contract in the deal, his agents, SportsTrust Advisors, wrote on Twitter on Monday night.The deal gives the Titans the running back threat they have lacked since releasing Chris Johnson, while the Eagles rid themselves of one of the contracts signed by their former coach Chip Kelly.Murray signed a five-year, $40 million contract with $21 million guaranteed with Philadelphia last year.Other terms of the deal were not immediately available.The Titans hold the No. 1 pick in the April draft and have eight draft picks  three in the top 64 selections.This will be the first big move by the Titans new general manager, Jon Robinson, who was hired in January to turn around a franchise that has gone 5-27 since releasing Johnson in April 2014 to avoid the final three seasons of a $53.5 million deal. Johnson was the last running back to run for 100 yards in a game for Tennessee, a drought that stretches to December 2013.The Titans ranked 25th in the N.F.L. last season, averaging 92.8 yards rushing per game, and the new coach, Mike Mularkey, has talked about running the ball much more next season.Murray led the N.F.L. in rushing with 1,845 yards and 13 touchdowns for Dallas in 2014 and was the N.F.L. offensive player of the year.He ran for only 702 yards with the Eagles last season, including 112 yards Oct. 19 against the Giants. Murray, a six-year veteran, has run for 5,228 yards and 34 touchdowns in his career, averaging 4.6 yards per carry. He also has 215 receptions for 1,522 yards.REDSKINS CUT GRIFFIN In the end, quarterback Robert Griffin III was just another name on a list, one of four players released by the Redskins to create salary-cap space.The move, expected for some time, brings an end to Griffins sudden-rise-and-stunning-fall saga with a team that traded a bevy of draft picks to acquire him  and now receives nothing in return as he departs. The move gets Griffins 2016 contract, worth about $16 million, off the payroll before Wednesday, when the new league year begins and free agents can be signed.It also closes the book on Griffins tumultuous tenure in Washington. He arrived as a Heisman Trophy winner and the No. 2 overall choice in the 2012 N.F.L. draft  a pick that came from the Rams at the high price of three first-round selections plus a second-rounder  and immediately became a star and national sensation. He leaves having spent all of last season on the sideline.As a free agent, he can sign anywhere.In a lengthy posting on Instagram, Griffin wrote: Although my time here is over, Im excited about what the future brings!!!! I look forward to finding the team where God has me to be and growing with that team on the way to World Championships.The Redskins, the N.F.C. East champions, also released safeties Dashon Goldson and Jeron Johnson, and defensive end Jason Hatcher, part of a busy day that removed nearly $30 million from Washingtons spending toward the cap and brings the team below the ceiling. In addition, fullback Darrel Young and nose tackle Terrance Knighton indicated on Twitter that they would not be brought back.INAPPROPRIATE QUESTION The Falcons said that the secondary coach Marquand Manuel asked the inappropriate question Do you like men? to Ohio State cornerback Eli Apple during the N.F.L.s annual scouting combine in Indianapolis.Manuel and the rest of the Atlanta staff received social training Monday from a counselor approved by the league. Falcons Coach Dan Quinn said there was additional training for Manuel.BUCS MANKINS RETIRING Buccaneers offensive lineman Logan Mankins is retiring after 11 N.F.L. seasons. Mankins, a seven-time Pro Bowl guard, played the past two seasons with the Bucs after spending nine years with the Patriots.STEELERS RETAIN TWO The Steelers signed safety Robert Golden and wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey to three-year deals before they could become free agents.SEAHAWKS KEEP LINEMAN The Seahawks addressed one of their biggest questions before the start of free agency by agreeing to terms on a new deal with defensive tackle Ahtyba Rubin. Rubin was a big reason the Seahawks led the N.F.L. in run defense, giving up just 81.5 yards per game.COLTS RE-SIGN TIGHT END  The Colts have re-signed tight end Dwayne Allen to a contract extension. Allen was taken by the Colts in the third round of the 2012 draft and has 91 receptions for 1,045 yards and 13 touchdowns in his career. Indianapolis also released the backup Josh Freeman, leaving only two quarterbacks on the roster: Andrew Luck and Stephen Morris.TWO RAVENS GET DEALS The Ravens signed cornerback Shareece Wright to a three-year deal and long snapper Morgan Cox to a five-year contract."}

{"text": "Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how daily news, features and opinion pieces come together at The New York Times.Super Tuesday started with a map  a blank, gray map of 50 states stretching across the home page of The New York Times.By the end of the night, 12 of those states would bloom in color  in various shades of red (Donald J. Trump), green (Bernie Sanders), blue (Hillary Clinton), purple (Marco Rubio) and yellow (Ted Cruz).It was a way to show Times readers, in real time, how the vote was shaping up in the states that went to the polls on March 1  who was ahead, who had won, how many precincts had been counted, how many were out.The map was a result of imagination, technology and teamwork; it was set in motion by The Timess digital graphics team and was built using real-time data feeds from The Associated Press.Color appeared as soon as the first precincts began reporting, starting with Virginia (just after 7 p.m.) and ending with Alaska (in the early-morning hours on Wednesday).The totals were fed by A.P. reporters, via The A.P., to The Timess infrastructure  and onto our map. And it wasnt just the state totals that readers were seeing; readers could click on individual states and see how each county voted.States were first colored in pale stripes, but those often changed. Oklahoma, for example, went from Trump (red stripes) to Cruz (yellow stripes). When The Associated Press called a winner, the color for that state went solid.In many of these cases, readers were being told the winner of each state about the same time our reporters and editors were getting the news. That gave our readers a real-time experience that was once available only from live reports on television.There was a time, not too long ago, when our Super Tuesday map would have been impossible to put together and display. Even earlier in the digital era, a complete vote-totals map wouldnt have been available until every ballot was counted at the end of the night. (Not to mention that in the print-only era, no map would be available until two days after the vote, and then often only in black and white.)As primary season continues, readers will see even more states fill with color. And if John Kasich takes a primary or state caucus, we will have to add a new one."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  The Federal Communications Commission said Monday that it had reached a settlement with Verizon Wireless for its use of hidden tracking technology known as supercookies, which were used for targeted advertising without customers permission.As part of the settlement, Verizon Wireless was fined $1.35 million and is required to notify consumers of its data collection program, as well as get permission from users before sharing consumer data with third-party partners.The penalty was small, but the enforcement action drew wide attention from the telecom industry as a glimpse of the F.C.C.s expanding ambitions into privacy regulation. The agency is expected to soon consider first-time privacy rules for Internet service providers that could include mandates that wireless and fixed broadband providers get permission from users before tracking their behavior online.As early as this week, the F.C.C. chairman, Tom Wheeler, may circulate a proposal on privacy for the five-member agency to vote on at the end of the month.The Verizon supercookies issue has been one of the big poster children for why you need to worry about ISPs tracking their customers and why you need rules for ISPs, said Harold Feld, a legal analyst at the nonprofit media advocacy group Public Knowledge, referring to Internet service providers.In its 15-month investigation of Verizon Wireless, the F.C.C. said it found that even among customers who had tried to delete regular cookies from their mobile browsers, the supercookies, or hidden code unique to each customer, were undeletable and used as a workaround to continue data collection. From 2012 to late 2014, Verizon Wireless used supercookies that could follow a mobile subscribers browsing history, the F.C.C. said, and Verizon Wireless and third-party companies used that data to target ads to users.Consumers care about privacy and should have a say in how their personal information is used, especially when it comes to who knows what theyre doing online, Travis LeBlanc, F.C.C. enforcement bureau chief, said.After the F.C.C. began its investigation, Verizon Wireless said, it began to disclose to customers its use of supercookies and provided the ability to opt out of data collection.Over the past year, we have made several changes to our advertising programs that have provided consumers with even more options, Richard Young, a Verizon spokesman, said. Todays settlement with the F.C.C. recognizes that.The requirement of opt-in consent for data sharing with third-party companies gives mobile users a little more control over the consumer tracking of online ad networks and data analytics firms.It also shows a greater interest by the F.C.C. to oversee consumer privacy. Jonathan Mayer, a privacy scholar at Stanford Law School, revealed on his blog last year that Turn, an advertising software company, was using Verizons supercookies to regenerate its own tracking tags after consumers had chosen to delete cookies. In November, Mr. Mayer was hired by the F.C.C."}
{"text": "Gov. Chris Christie says he first met Donald J. Trump 14 years ago as a courtesy to Judge Maryanne Trump Barry, after she told him, My little brother really wants to meet you.Mr. Christie had just become the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey. Mr. Trump owned casinos in Atlantic City, where it makes sense to have friends in law enforcement. But Mr. Christie left friends and associates with the impression that he was just as eager to meet Mr. Trump.He began referring to Mr. Trump as a friend of mine, the way he later would Jerry Jones, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys, whose private plane and private box he enjoyed; King Abdullah, who hosted him on a lavish weekend in the Jordanian desert; Bono, the singer of U2, who joined them at parties there; and, after a long period of unrequited adulation, Bruce Springsteen. Much like Mr. Trump, Mr. Christie had shown that he liked to be around People Who Matter.That request for a meeting from a big sister started a curious friendship of convenience  some call it deeply transactional  that led to Mr. Christies surprise endorsement of Mr. Trump last week in the Republican presidential race.The endorsement could be their ultimate transaction: Mr. Trump, having seized Mr. Christies position as the tell-it-like-it-is candidate in the Republican primary, is in a fierce fight to lock up the nomination. Mr. Christie, a term-limited governor estranged from his state after spending most of his second term away from it, is looking to extend his relevance.Mr. Christie defended himself against the blowback  the Internet ridicule and denunciations from his financial backers, the calls for his resignation from the New Jersey Republicans who had once jumped at his command. At a news conference on Thursday, he said that he could govern his state and campaign for Mr. Trump at the same time, and scoffed at the reaction to his stand-by-your-man appearance beside Mr. Trump on Super Tuesday: I wasnt being held hostage.Those who know both Mr. Christie and Mr. Trump describe them as alike in many ways: Polarizing and self-regarding, each can summon the charm to make an acquaintance feel like the only person in the room, and just as quickly turn if a relationship no longer suits his interests. Mr. Trump is The Donald; Mr. Christies re-election slogan was The Governor.They both have very immense egos; they both sort of have the feeling that they have the power to do anything, said Alan Steinberg, who served in the administrations of Gov. Christie Whitman and President George W. Bush. (Mr. Steinberg supported Mr. Christie for governor but now backs Senator Ted Cruz of Texas for president.)They think they can just bully their way through, he added. They both skirt the edge; they both have tendencies toward mendacity. Its the perfect bromance.Mr. Christie has told audiences variously that it was during a face-to-face meeting or on a phone call that Judge Barry, with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Newark, asked him to meet her brother in 2002.Mr. Christie was relatively new to public life, and eager for it; he had been a Morris County freeholder, but failed in his campaigns for higher office and was appointed federal prosecutor after his brother, Todd, donated handsomely to Mr. Bushs first presidential campaign.Mr. Trump had long worked Atlantic City politics to suit his casino interests, but he had just lost a fight against a tunnel project that would serve a casino proposed by his longtime archrival, Steve Wynn; Mr. Trump called the tunnel Steve Wynns private driveway. Mr. Wynn now supports Mr. Trump for president.Mr. Christie and Mr. Trump met over dinner at Jean-Georges, the celebrity-chef restaurant in one of Mr. Trumps towers on the West Side of Manhattan. Mr. Christie recalled Mr. Trumps ordering for him when the chef, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, came out to greet him. (The special thing you made for me?  Well take two of those, too. )Three years later, Mr. Christies friends in New Jersey were impressed when he was invited to Mr. Trumps third wedding, in Palm Beach, Fla.That was kind of a whos who, said State Senator Joe Kyrillos, a longtime friend of Mr. Christie who as the New Jersey Republican Party chairman helped him become a United States attorney, but supported Jeb Bush for president after a falling out with Mr. Christie. I recall Hillary was there, too. (The other most prominent New Jersey face among the crowd was George Norcross, a Democratic power broker often described as the most powerful nonelected person in the state, who was then a frequent golf partner of Mr. Trumps and later helped Mr. Christie win and govern in a blue state.)Republicans were equally surprised to see Mr. Trump in the third row of a Newark basilica for the Mass before Mr. Christies inauguration in 2010. (Mr. Trump was not a stranger to New Jersey governors and their inaugurations; when Barry Manilow canceled a plan to play at Governor Whitmans inauguration party in Atlantic City at the last minute, Mr. Trump prevailed on Paul Anka to fill in.)Of course, any highly public relationship like the one between Mr. Trump and Mr. Christie can make for awkward situations. As United States attorney, Mr. Christie went after Charles Kushner, a real-estate developer and major New Jersey political donor who pleaded guilty in 2005 to tax evasion and making illegal campaign contributions  and four years later became the father-in-law of Mr. Trumps daughter Ivanka.But by 2010, Mr. Trump was then battling with another rich New Yorker, Carl Icahn, to win back control of his Atlantic City casinos after they entered bankruptcy. He won a month after Mr. Christies inauguration. A year later, the governor, Mr. Trump and their wives landed on Page Six, in The New York Post, after another dinner at Jean-Georges. Mr. Icahn became a backer of Mr. Trump for president; Mr. Trump suggested he might appoint him Treasury secretary.Mr. Trump made a larger-than-usual donation, of $250,000, to the Republican Governors Association in 2014, when Mr. Christie led it. Mr. Kushner, too, has held at least one event for Mr. Trump at his home on the Jersey Shore.It started out professional, but I think its definitely evolved into a more personal relationship, Dale Florio, a longtime Republican fund-raiser in New Jersey, said of the Trump-Christie connection.Others who know the two men describe their alliance more as an acquaintanceship, as many of Mr. Trumps relationships are. His true friendships are limited to the small number of people he plays golf with in Palm Beach or at Trump National Golf Club Bedminster, which he created from the former estate of John DeLorean, the flamboyant auto industry executive, in the heart of New Jersey horse country. (Mr. Christie is not a golfer.)Once they started to compete to be the Republican nominee, the friendship became strained.As Mr. Trump surged in the polls, one New Jersey political leader, who like many people interviewed for this article did not want to be identified out of fear of reprisals from either man, said he had urged Mr. Christie to directly confront Mr. Trump, saying he was the only candidate who could do it. Mr. Christie did not disagree, this person said, but he was afraid to do it  hes never been afraid of anybody.He thought Trump would do to him what he did to Megyn Kelly, this person continued, referring to the Fox News anchor Mr. Trump relentlessly demeaned because he did not like her questions in an early debate.Mr. Trump, however, did not hold back. He declared that Mr. Christie totally knew about the lane closings at the George Washington Bridge that were engineered to punish a perceived political enemy, and that the governor could never win the nomination given his dive in popularity and his record in New Jersey.But after Mr. Christie dropped out following his fifth-place showing in the New Hampshire primary last month, he told allies he appreciated that Mr. Trump had called him that very night. The two men had a long talk.Six days after he dropped out, Mr. Christie told about 40 guests gathered over coffee and cookies before his budget address that he did not see a path to the nomination for anyone but Mr. Trump.Still, on a phone call two days later, he told the states Republican Party county leaders to keep their powder dry when it came to endorsements, in the words of one person on the call.A week later, he and his wife had breakfast with Mr. Trump at Trump Tower, in Manhattan. The governor jumped at the chance to go to Texas to endorse his former rival.He would not have done this unless he thinks that the only path forward for him is with Trump, and that Trump is going to win, said a high-ranking Republican, referring to the governor.Mr. Trump, standing next to Mr. Christie in Texas last month, said, Generally speaking, Im not big on endorsements. This was an endorsement that really meant a lot.At his news conference on Thursday, Mr. Christie said that he had no current plans to go on the road with Mr. Trump again. Still, he remained unbowed.If he had not been in the race, he said, I would have been the nominee."}

Nobody seems to be moving.Do we have to go to the 1 track? I say to the woman behind me. I dont know, she says. Everyone is now late for work. I think we have to go over there, I say. She follows me down the stairs. The crowd on the 1 platform is even thicker.One minute later I hear, A 2 express train to Wakefield Avenue is now approaching on the express track. What! I plow through the crowd, run back down the stairs, across to the other staircase and tear up to the express platform. The No. 2 train is packed solid, but the doors are still open.Oh, hell no, I say, sort of to the multiple stragglers on the platform who have given up any chance of getting to work on time. I stuff myself in a nonexistent space. The doors close repeatedly on me, and then on my backpack  progress.I turn slightly and a lady on the platform shoves my backpack through the doors. They close.

{"text": "In this time of political absurdity, can it be any surprise that a federal immigration judge insists that toddlers can represent themselves in immigration court?The judge, Jack Weil, did not appear to be joking when, in a deposition in a federal lawsuit, he told a lawyer from the American Civil Liberties Union: Ive taught immigration law literally to 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds. It takes a lot of time. It takes a lot of patience. They get it.The case, brought in federal court in Seattle by a coalition of immigrant rights organizations, is challenging the Obama administrations attempts to deport thousands of Central American children who have been detained at the southern border in recent years. The suit seeks to have the government provide lawyers for the children as they go through immigration court.The children are part of an influx of families fleeing persecution in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. This emergency has become a political headache for the Obama administration, which has been doing all it can to handle the arrivals of thousands of would-be refugees while deterring future arrivals. Among other tactics, it has been rushing their cases through the clogged immigration courts with the so-called rocket docket and has recently been conducting raids to round up immigrants who have not responded to deportation orders.While federal law does not require that noncitizens be given government-appointed lawyers in immigration proceedings, it does require a full and fair hearing before a judge. Yet the administration argues that it has no constitutional obligation to provide counsel for children in immigration court and refuses to acknowledge the injustice of having children too young to understand the legal process fending for themselves in deportation hearings.The result would be farcical were it not also tragic, because these children face grave danger, if not violent death, in being returned to their home countries.Not everybody gets this. At a hearing last month in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, one of Washingtons leading nativists, raised an alarm about the children at the border not because they were being denied due process, but because the government was failing to deport them faster. But under international and American law, they have every right to ask for protection.Many of them do lose their cases and are ordered deported, often in absentia if they fail to show up for hearings. Mr. Sessions and others see this as evidence of criminality. More likely its because these children have no one to help them make their case and dont understand what the court expects of them. Immigration advocates note that when children are represented by counsel, they are far more likely to return to court, and far less likely to be ordered deported.A bill by Senator Harry Reid would require that the government appoint lawyers for unaccompanied children and for victims of abuse, torture or other violence. It would also require the Department of Homeland Security to make sure immigrant detainees know their rights and responsibilities under the law. But since the bill is unlikely to become law anytime soon, the Obama administration needs to act, now, to ensure that children receive a fair day in court.It could start by reordering the immigration docket to give children and guardians more time to find lawyers. Lawyers with advocacy groups are striving to meet the need, but the caseload is crushing. Theres a lot of government money being spent now to represent unaccompanied children, said Ahilan Arulanantham, an A.C.L.U. lawyer involved in the Seattle case. The government could proceed against children who have counsel, he said, and push to the back of the line those who dont.These children and their lawyers could also pursue remedies outside immigration court  for example, in seeking special visas for victims of human trafficking and other crimes. There should never be a rush to push children who are alone through a process that doesnt begin to resemble justice."}

In pride of place was the designers beaming father, Paul McCartney, alongside his wife, Nancy Shevell.Wasnt it a stormer? Wasnt it just great?

But I feel like this collection was particularly witty and sexy.And the closing song was pretty great, too, dont you think? he added with a wink.The track in question was his own 1974 hit with the band Wings, Nineteen Hundred and Eighty-Five, which had many in the crowd whooping with delight  Jess Glynne, the flame-haired British pop singer, among them. She had arrived in Paris that morning after completing the United States and British legs of her tour.I met Stella at the Brit Awards last week and we had such a laugh on the night that she invited me along to the show today, said Ms. Glynne, who racked up five No. 1 singles in Britain last year, and performed at the Coachella festival in California. I thought she was the loveliest lady.This is my first-ever show in Paris so it feels incredibly exciting, because the more my career develops the more Ive been thinking about the importance of fashion, of how I look as well as how I sing, she continued. In this industry you need to develop your image like an armor, something protective and comfortable but also recognizable."}
{"text": "They are as much a fixture on the streets of Astoria, Queens, as the souvlaki shops and markets selling lamb and feta straight from Greece: a group of about a dozen men, of varying ages, who share the same bleary eyes and frequently unsteady gaits when their indulgences  in marijuana and liquor  catch up to them. Well known to shop owners and local residents, the men stand out from the increasingly hip and well-heeled new arrivals to the neighborhood  ruffians, but benign, viewed more as lost than as a menace.But on Sunday afternoon, one of these fixtures, James Patrick Dillon, 23, erupted in a spree of violence, according to the authorities. The police said he stabbed a neighbor in the head late Sunday morning; killed George Patouhas, a liquor store owner, in a knife attack a few hours later; and doused another man in accelerant and set him on fire.By Sunday evening it was over. The police shot Mr. Dillon in the backyard of the house on 36th Street in which he lived with at least one of his parents, after a police chase in which the authorities say he sprayed two officers in the face with liquid. Mr. Dillon, who by Monday evening had not been formally charged, remained in critical but stable condition at Elmhurst Hospital Center.Both of the surviving victims were treated and released, Berta Carpio from Mount Sinai Hospital of Queens, and Julio Bolaos from NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center.On Monday, Ms. Carpio, 39, sat in her apartment on 30th Street with a white bandage covering the five staples holding together her head wound. She said Mr. Dillon had stabbed her on Sunday as she walked past him on her way to church. She said he had verbally lashed out twice in previous months, furious after she looked in his direction, but Sunday was the first time it had been physical.I thought it was the last day of my life, she said.The liquor store that Mr. Patouhas, a local landlord, owned on Astoria Boulevard and 38th Street is the central point in the aimless march that the group of men that included Mr. Dilion routinely make, according to several of them and other residents. Other stops include a park near Horace Greeley Middle School, a lonely alley on 37th Street and a few bars.Among the men who hung around, Mr. Dillon is known only as Fox, which some said is the name of his dog, a pit bull-German shepherd mix that was almost always with him, as was his black mountain bike. He used to use the dog to scare people, said Andrew King, 47, who lives around the corner. Let it go loose. When little kids would pass by.Mr. Dillon would dress in a conspicuously outdated style, in Wrangler jeans and New Balance sneakers, said a friend who spent time with him in the alley and declined to give his name. Nobody would make fun of him, he said. They were scared of him.Others saw Mr. Dillon differently. He was a very loving child, said a member of his extended family who insisted that no name be used, citing privacy concerns.A man who gave his name only as George, 35, said he was suprised that Mr. Dillon would congregate with the group of men, because he had a home. I told him you have a house  thats like a million dollars, George said on Monday afternoon. His jeans were still covered with blood that he said was sprayed on him on Sunday as he tried to stanch Mr. Patouhass wound.Mr. Dillon, who grew up in Astoria, had a penchant for picking fights, which were settled on the blacktop of the park near the middle school, several people who know him said. A law enforcement source said he had been arrested seven times before, most recently on a menacing charge in 2013 and a marijuana possession charge in 2009. The five other arrests were when he was a juvenile.The police have not cited a motive in Sundays violent crime spree, but some who know Mr. Dillon saw it as the end of a monthlong unraveling. One said that he had begun to slur his words, and would utter unpredictable things. A few weeks ago, according to the friend who would hang out with him in the alley, Mr. Dillon stood on a sidewalk slamming his bicycle into the ground over and over again for no apparent reason.Late Monday afternoon, the other survivor, Mr. Bolaos, 61, returned to the liquor store where the day before, he said, Mr. Dillon had sprayed him with a fluid and set his trousers on fire. That happened moments after the police say Mr. Dillon fatally stabbed Mr. Patouhas in the neck. Mr. Bolaos, his right leg still raw and blistered, said the owner had allowed him to keep cat food at the store and spend his days there hanging out and feeding stray cats.My friend was bleeding from his neck, Mr. Bolaos said, becoming emotional. I miss him."}
{"text": "OXFORD, England  In the five years since the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdowns that devastated Fukushima Prefecture, the Japanese government has undertaken mammoth efforts to decontaminate irradiated communities.Thousands of workers have removed millions of tons of radioactive debris from backyards and fields, roadsides and school grounds. They have scraped away acres and acres of tainted soil, collected surface vegetal matter, wiped down entire buildings and hosed and scrubbed streets and sidewalks.The cleanup effort is staggering in scale, and unprecedented. Japans leaders hope to restore for human habitation more than 100 cities, towns and villages scattered over hundreds of square miles. The government has allocated more than $15 billion for this work.The Japanese authorities call these efforts josen (decontamination), but the word is misleading and the activity largely a fallacy. Whats happening is more like transcontamination: Once the radioactive debris is collected and bagged, it is transferred from one part of Fukushima to another, and then another.The waste is placed in bags, which are periodically collected and brought to provisional storage areas (kari-kari-okiba), before being moved to more secure, though still temporary, storage depots (kari-okiba). Officials at the Ministry of the Environment have said up to 30 million tons of radioactive waste will eventually be moved to yet another, third-level interim storage facility near the crippled Fukushima Daiichi plant. But no significant construction has begun. In fact, the authorities havent even managed to convince all the relevant absentee landowners in the area to sell the necessary plots.So for now the radioactive waste is either lying around or being moved around. Throughout Fukushima, there are large cylindrical plastic sacks  each roughly the size of a hot tub and weighing about a ton when full  stacked in desultory heaps by the side of roads, near driveways or in abandoned lots. In the town of Tomioka in mid-October, I saw three dozen bags piled along the edges of a small cemetery, overtaken by weeds.The bags deteriorate after three years, meaning that the waste has to be repackaged regularly. Sacks are sometimes moved from one facility to another, based on their levels of radioactivity, which vary and can shift over time. By last fall, there were more than 9 million one-ton bags of radioactive waste. Standard trucks carry fewer than 10 bags at a time  meaning that radioactive material is regularly rotating around Fukushima in a slow-motion version of pass the nuclear parcel.There is no practical, much less economical, way to completely neutralize radiation. It can only be removed and isolated to allow natural decay, which, in the case of much of the low-level waste at Fukushima, may take decades or a few centuries.That basically leaves two viable options for dealing with radioactivity. Either turn over contaminated areas to natural decay, as the Soviet authorities did with some 1,000 square miles irradiated by the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Or securely store the waste.Japan is too densely populated to abandon such a vast swath of land as Fukushima. But it has yet to build any permanent or semipermanent storage facility for any kind of nuclear waste: No one wants radioactive material in their backyard, perhaps especially not the Japanese, after their experiences of the bombings at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and then the Fukushima meltdowns.Partly as a result, Japanese policymakers have only come up with stop-gap solutions  when they have come up with any solution at all. Keeping radioactive waste in motion between provisional storage sites isnt a coherent nuclear policy; its an elaborate dodge and a play for time.Japans decontamination plan for Fukushima is so fiendishly complicated that its goals cannot possibly be met within the promised 30 years. And thats only to talk about the waste that has been collected.The twisted, irradiated wreckage of Fukushima Daiichi itself will have to be dismantled and properly disposed of. Yet its final destination also remains unspecified. Given how much more toxic some of that waste is  it includes residual fuel  it would need to be put away in an even more secure facility than the interim kind Japan has not managed to build.These problems are emblematic of the broader failures of the Japan governments nuclear policy.The authorities still dont have a workable plan for disposing of the 47 metric tons of plutonium and the thousands of tons of uranium Japan has accumulated over years of producing energy at nuclear plants. Both are extremely radioactive and require storage in highly secure permanent facilities  such as underground granite chambers, as exist in Finland, or subterranean salt formations, as in the United States.Even if Japan were to decommission all of its 56 reactors, as some people are advocating, doing so would generate about 500,000 cubic meters of lower-level radioactive waste, and that also has nowhere to go.Its time the Japanese government tackles the issues head-on. Either it takes the exceedingly unpopular step of imposing a more secure facility on one or more unwilling communities, or it must acknowledge the obvious, which is that the core of Fukushimas exclusion zone will become a gigantic de facto nuclear waste dump indefinitely.As for higher-level waste, the government should fund its shipping and storing in permanent repositories abroad: Japan is too prone to earthquakes to host any such facility. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry is currently studying the feasibility of a plan to permanently store spent fuel under the seabed 10 to 15 kilometers from Japans shores. In such a seismically unstable area, the very idea is preposterous.Admitting these hard truths might scuttle the Abe administrations plan to restart more of the nuclear reactors that were put offline after the Fukushima disaster. But the Japanese public deserves no less, especially given the costs and the stakes of the governments current policy.The defilement of Fukushima wasnt just the result of a natural catastrophe. It was also the aftermath of a manmade disaster caused by a slapdash approach to nuclear safety. Five years on, the Japanese government isnt handling these issues any more responsibly."}

The Bible is, for many people, the most compelling book ever written, but its power is not remotely captured here. More to the point, the effort to substitute standard-issue television intrigue and sizzle for the sweep and wonderment of the source material fails. This muddled series, at least from the first three episodes, doesnt give a viewer much to latch onto.Ray Winstone is King Saul, investing the character with a growly, haunted turn that must have been fun for the actor but leaves you searching for this kings leadership qualities. Sauls immediate task is to unite the 12 tribes of Israel so they can do battle against the more powerful Philistines, but his real foe presumably will eventually be the shepherd David (Olly Rix).Thats because David has been singled out as Gods next chosen leader, at least by the prophet Samuel (Mohammad Bakri). A prophet can be played as a beatific ascetic, but this Samuel is the polar opposite: wild-eyed and somewhat scary, the kind of fellow who when he sits down next to you at a bar causes you to finish your drink in a gulp and leave.Its a portrayal that could pay off later if other characters have to confront the possibility that Samuel is just a nut, but it leaves God largely absent from this shows early episodes. Saul has an obligatory Fiddler on the Roof moment or two where he bellows unanswerable questions at the sky, but this series from Adam Cooper and Bill Collage doesnt aspire to imitate the Mark Burnett-Roma Downey formula that has been so successful in reaching viewers of faith in mini-series like The Bible and The Dovekeepers.Rather, it seems more interested in the sword-and-sandal crowd, trying to play up the storys palace intrigues and romantic complications. Simone Kessell is Queen Ahinoam, Sauls wife, who is a bit of a schemer but is also shamed by the kings preference for concubines. Ms. Kessell gives the most intriguing performance in the sprawling multinational cast; its too bad shes not around more.Sauls daughters  Maisie Richardson-Sellers as Michal and Jeanine Mason as Merav  are the other women of note in the story. They arent given much character depth, though, which leaves the sagas romantic entanglements uninvolving, especially against all the other current series working the power-and-sex dynamic, whether ancient, midcentury or present-day.So finding something to grab hold of in this show isnt easy. If you bear with it, though, Episode 3 brings things more sharply into focus, thanks in part to a familiar name. Turns out the Philistines have this big guy, Goliath, who eats Israels best warriors for lunch. Is there no one who can take on this fearsome giant?"}
{"text": "A listener might assume that a new symphony called Strange Sounds and Explosions Worldwide would depict perilous global situations. But the title of Tonia Kos new symphony alludes to fireworks and other joyful events, as well as natural ones like erupting volcanoes.In its premiere on Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall, Ms. Kos piece was performed by the New York Youth Symphony, which offers tuition-free training and performance opportunities to musicians ages 12 to 22. The ensemble, which recently celebrated its 50th anniversary, has a strong composition program and has awarded commissions to 139 composers age 30 and under since 1984 through its First Music project.At its annual Carnegie concerts, the ensemble presents one of those commissions. Joshua Gersen, its music director, conducted Ms. Kos work.In writing the symphony, Ms. Ko, 27, who was born in Hong Kong and raised in Hawaii, conducted spectral analyses of audio clips of explosions and experimented with other sounds. The resulting piece for acoustic instruments proved more somber and eerie than jubilant, its initial rumblings morphing into dramatic surges. Ms. Kos vivid orchestral palette included fragile whispers in the upper strings interrupted by ominous brass flourishes, with sonic explosions following more sparsely orchestrated fragments.Next, Mr. Gersen conducted the young musicians in a stirring rendition of Tchaikovskys smoldering Piano Concerto No. 1, with Steven Lin as the able soloist. A few slips aside, he tackled the virtuoso passages and daunting octaves with aplomb and rendered the lyrical sections with an introspective grace.Rachmaninoffs darkly colored, richly melodic Symphonic Dances, his final composition, concluded the program. At times it could have used more rhythmic bite, but it offered a chance for all sections of the ensemble to shine, with lush, passionate playing from the strings and admirable contributions from the winds and brass."}
{"text": "The 1968 introduction of a record-playback model of the Sony Portapak, which yoked a video camera to a video recorder in a lightweight format, was without a doubt seminal in media history. For various counterculture idealists, the relatively affordable, low-resolution devices had utopian truth-telling potential. Here Come the Videofreex, a concise and informative documentary directed by Jon Nealon and Jenny Raskin, tells the story of one such collective.The Portapak early adopters David Cort and Parry Teasdale stumble upon each other at Woodstock, both of them recording none of the music and instead capturing possibly incriminating (in retrospect) pronouncements from shaggy baby boomers. (One hippie drawls that the parents of the past generation have made a mess of their kids  the hippie actually uses a barnyard epithet to describe what theyve done  and one has every confidence that this individual has since heard something similar or worse from his own children or grandchildren by now.) With some like-minded friends and lovers Mr. Cort and Mr. Teasdale created the Videofreex collective. An alliance with media giant CBS is pursued, and proves abortive, but not before the Videofreex capture some galvanizing footage, including an interview with Fred Hampton, the Illinois chairman of the Black Panther Party, conducted weeks before Hampton was killed by the police in 1969.The tools of portable video were such, the members recall, that men and women started at the same learning curve, and women were able to cover the feminist movement in great detail. As financing and transmitting concerns mount, the movie sees the collective mutating from activists to educators and community entertainers. The utopia they envisioned has yet to materialize, to say the least, but seeing their efforts is heartening.Here Come the Videofreex is not rated. Running time: 1 hour 19 minutes."}
{"text": "Hossein Fatemis photos of Iran provide an unvarnished and intimate view of his homeland. His project An Iranian Journey, which was published on Lens in 2013, earned Mr. Fatemi the World Understanding award in the Pictures of the Year International contest last month.Im trying to get away from the stereotypes and clichs that Western cultures have about the Iranian people, said Mr. Fatemi, 35. Most Americans have a third world perception and cant even separate Arab culture from Persian culture.Mr. Fatemi says there is a lifetimes worth of photographs for him to make in his country.But he cannot.The day after Mr. Fatemis story was featured on the website of his photo agency, Panos Pictures, he received the first of many emails from conservative hard-liners who wield power in political parties, official news media and the government. They accused him of undermining Islam and of having a Western ideology and perspective, Mr. Fatemi said. Similar emails were sent to his photo agency, and its website was blocked in Iran.At the time, Mr. Fatemi was visiting a photo festival in San Diego, and it quickly became clear to him that it would be too dangerous to return to Iran.Although he settled in Chicago, he did not give up on documentary photography in Iran. He enlisted eight of his former students and started A Journey Inside, a documentary project on social issues in Iran. Although he could not be there physically, Mr. Fatemi stayed in contact through Skype, social media, email and phone.The stories the participants  four men and four women from different parts of the country  chose focused on the place of women in Iranian society, university students, drought and a disabled war veteran. Mr. Fatemi did not tell them to take any particular point of view or political position.Ijust want them to be free and take the pictures they need to, he said. I chose a subject that would not cause them to be arrested or get into any trouble if they were published. There are many subjects that could force photographers to leave the country as I did.Indeed, scores of photographers have fled Iran since the post-election protests and 2009 crackdown, he added.Mr. Fatemi arranged and led virtual workshops throughout Iran to teach his students how to be better visual storytellers and to have an open-minded viewpoint. At times, local government officials banned his workshops because they included men and women together and because a critical documentary viewpoint was politically unacceptable.The project lasted 14 months, including training and photographing under the supervision of Mr. Fatemi and Panos Pictures, with the assistance of Maryam Athari. The photographers included Zahra Ostadzadeh, Bahar Aslani, Hossein Heidarpour, Hamid Akhlaghi, Negin Kiani, Saeed Zeidi, Mahya Rastegar and Ali Tajik.Ms. Ostadzadeh, who has a masters degree in sociology, concentrates on womens issues in her photography and video work. For the project, she documented an all-girls boarding school in Kerman Province where, she said, the girls were satisfied by what they have, even though in the larger society women are sometimes seen as inferior.I wanted my photos to improve their life, she said. My approach wasnt looking down at them. I dont want my photos to only show poverty. Instead I want to show lifes happiness and the great goals they envision. I want to show that despite all the poor conditions and poverty that should be changed they are still content.For Mr. Fatemi, receiving the award from POYi was a little bittersweet. Although he cannot return to Iran for now, he has forged a new way forward  with his students. The Journey Inside project was, he said, another way to get at the truth.Iran is a very complex and complicated country, he said. We photographers think that through this kind of photography we can understand ourselves, our beliefs and our viewpoints.Follow @jamesestrin and @nytimesphoto on Twitter.

{"text": "The World Health Organization advised pregnant women on Tuesday to avoid travel to areas where the Zika virus is spreading.Experts on the organizations Zika emergency committee also recommended that pregnant women and their partners who have been in areas with Zika rely on abstinence or safe sex to prevent sexual transmission of the virus.Sexual transmission is more common than previously assumed, said Dr. Margaret Chan, the agencys director general.Local transmission of the virus has now been reported in 31 countries or territories in Latin American and the Caribbean. The agency emphasized that it was not recommending that women avoid whole countries, but only areas where mosquitoes were transmitting the virus.The onus is on countries to report where they are having outbreaks, said Dr. David L. Heymann, the chairman of the emergency committee, who is a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Then its up to the pregnant women to decide whether they want to travel there.The committee also called for more research on the virus and better surveillance to track its spread.The panel suggested that countries intensively control mosquitoes near airports and consider spraying insecticide inside planes before takeoff, a common anti-malaria measure.The committee stopped short of advising women to delay pregnancy if they live in areas in which the virus is circulating, but Dr. Chan said women who chose to do so should be given access to contraception.Asked why the committee had not advised women to delay pregnancies, Dr. Heymann said he considered that a national recommendation rather than one under the W.H.O.s mandate, which is to prevent the international spread of diseases.The virus has been linked to microcephaly  tiny heads and brain damage  in infants born to infected women.Some experts argue that persuading women to postpone pregnancy is the best way to prevent a wave of such birth defects, because mosquito control is usually ineffective, a vaccine is months off and previous Zika outbreaks rapidly peaked and fell.Travel advisories and birth control are sensitive topics for the W.H.O. because it is a United Nations organization, and its member states sometimes object to medical advice they feel interferes with tourism, business or domestic policies.This is the first time the W.H.O. has advised that pregnant women avoid travel. Previously, the W.H.O. had advised women only to consider delaying travel.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued similar warnings weeks ago. On Jan. 15, the C.D.C. advised pregnant American women to consider avoiding travel to any countries or territories where the Zika virus was being transmitted.That advice upset officials in countries with low-risk areas. For example, although Mexico is on the list, Mexico City is at a high altitude and mosquito-borne diseases are not a threat.On Feb. 4, the C.D.C. advised pregnant women to avoid unprotected sex with men who had been in areas where the Zika virus was spreading.The United States, Italy and France have all reported cases of suspected sexual transmission.Now, Dr. Chan said, the infection has also been linked to fetal death, slow fetal growth and injury to nerves in the developing brain, as well as to a temporary paralysis in children and adults called Guillain-Barr syndrome.We can conclude that the virus is neurotropic, she said, meaning it targets nerve and brain cells.Nine countries have reported either increases in cases of Guillain-Barr syndrome during Zika outbreaks or cases in which the virus was found in Guillain-Barr victims. The syndrome is caused by an autoimmune attack on the nervous system, often following a viral or bacterial infection.Cases of microcephaly following outbreaks of Zika virus have been reported only in Brazil and French Polynesia.But its a timeline because pregnancy is nine months long, Dr. Heymann said. What we see in Brazil now is what we could see in Colombia and other countries in the next few months, and its very alarming.The W.H.O. declared a public health emergency on Feb. 1 and asked donors to give $56 million toward the response. Dr. Chan said the agency had received only $3 million. We encourage countries to support this very important work, she said.Since the emergency declaration, Dr. Heymann said, the W.H.O. has reacted rapidly, issuing 10 sets of guidelines to countries on how to handle Zika virus outbreaks.He said evidence continued to mount that the virus, and nothing else, was to blame for increases in birth defects and Guillain-Barr in affected countries.The advisory committee said particular attention needed to be given to several research areas: studies comparing infected and uninfected pregnant women; genetic sequencing of viral strains; how often the infection causes symptoms; and whether asymptomatic infections are dangerous."}
{"text": "DETROIT  Hillary Clinton has a clearer path to the Democratic presidential nomination than she ever had in 2008. But she is marching toward November facing the likelihood of an unpredictable opponent  and constrained by well-defined characteristics that have always limited her ability to inspire.The former first lady calls it her responsibility gene; rivals deride it as poll-tested caution. Either way, it leaves Mrs. Clinton trying to hit singles and doubles while her Democratic socialist challenger swings for the fences.Bernie Sanders advocates tax increases of $15 trillion affecting all income groups; Mrs. Clinton seeks an additional $1 trillion in revenue and would leave the bottom 95 percent of earners alone. He calls for a Medicare for all single-payer health care system; Mrs. Clinton aims to build on President Obamas Affordable Care Act.He proposes breaking up Wall Street banks that have grown since the financial crisis; she backs tougher regulations but embraces the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that would dismantle banks posing systemic risks. He calls for $1 trillion in new spending to improve infrastructure and create jobs; she calls for $275 billion  half of what her husbands Treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, has advocated.Ive gone as far as I think the political equation will sustain, Mrs. Clinton said in an interview at a manufacturer of automobile dashboards. I want to propose things I can get done.Judged against the 10 years it took for a gridlocked Congress to pass long-term highway funding  Mr. Obama signed the $305 billion measure three months ago  Mrs. Clintons approach sounds reasonable. Yet she watches Mr. Sanders thrill young Democratic audiences by exhorting them to alter whats possible through political revolution.People make all these claims, Mrs. Clinton said, a hint of frustration in her voice. And its hard for voters to really evaluate how do they decide is this person, you know, being smart? Are they just overpromising? Are they way out in left field or right field?Thats why Ive tried to say, Look, heres what I will do. Heres how I will do it. Heres how much it will cost. I think thats pretty revolutionary.Her approach, honed by a generation of political combat, has her on track for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Sanderss success has so far exceeded most predictions, including almost certainly his own. But since cresting in New Hampshire, his Feel the Bern wave has receded with no sign of intensification as the contest shifts to larger, more diverse states.Has the storm passed? I hope so, Mrs. Clinton said. Then she added warily: Theres always something  something that can come at you, drop from the sky.Thats what Donald J. Trump has done to Republicans. If he succeeds, he would represent an opponent less restrained and more unpredictable than any she has faced before.Alongside her husband in 1992, Mrs. Clinton experienced a similar wild card in Ross Perots independent candidacy. Mr. Trump has broken even more rules than Mr. Perot did, from his unlikely proposal to deport 11 million illegal immigrants, to his lightning policy reversals, to the crude insults he sprays at opponents of all kinds.Like most Democrats, Mrs. Clintons campaign strategists say they believe the nonwhites driven to vote against Mr. Trump would exceed the additional white voters he would attract. But they cannot be certain.He attacked Mr. Clintons personal life after Mrs. Clinton accused him of sexism. He tells audiences she may be prosecuted over her private email server (the existence of which, many Democrats say, represents a paradoxical instance of her defensive instincts actually damaging her).It doesnt make me nervous, the cautious candidate said of running against Mr. Trump. After all, she added, Republicans have been after me for years. Nothing new about that."}
{"text": "Donald Trump is a walking political science course. His meteoric rise is lesson No. 1 on leadership: Most voters do not listen through their ears. They listen through their stomachs. If a leader can connect with them on a gut level, their response is: Dont bother me with the details. I trust your instincts. If a leader cant connect on a gut level, he or she cant show them enough particulars. Theyll just keep asking, Can you show me the details one more time?Trumps Republican rivals keep thinking that if they just point out a few more details about him, voters will drop The Donald and turn to one of them instead. But you cant talk voters out of something that they havent been talked into.Many have come to Trump out of a gut feeling that this is a guy who knows their pain, even if he really doesnt. Many of his supporters are from the #middleagewhitemalesmatter movement, for whom the current age of acceleration has not been kind and for whom Trumps rallies are their way of saying Can you hear me now? and of sticking it to all the people who exploited their pain but left them behind, particularly traditional Republican elites. They are not interested in Trumps details. They like his gut.And no wonder. Those G.O.P. elites sold their own souls and their party so many times to charlatans and plutocrats that you wonder when its going to show up on closeout on eBay: For sale: The G.O.P. soul. Almost empty. This soul was previously sold to Sarah Palin, the Tea Party anarchists, Rush Limbaugh, Grover Norquist, the gun lobby, the oil industry, the Koch brothers, Sheldon Adelson and Fox News. Will bargain. No offer too low.Normally smart people, like Mitt Romney, discarded all their best instincts to suck up to this ragtag assortment of self-appointed G.O.P. commissars, each representing a different slice of what came to be Republican orthodoxy  climate change is a hoax; abortion, even in the case of rape or incest, is impermissible; even common-sense gun laws must be opposed, no matter how many kids get murdered; taxes must always be cut and safety nets shrunk, no matter what the economic context; Obamacare must be destroyed, even though it was based on a Republican idea; and Iraq was a success even though it was a mess.The G.O.P. became an accretion of ideas that ossified over the years without the party ever stopping to ask afresh: What world are we living in now? What are the dominant trends? And how does America best exploit them by applying conservative values and market-based solutions?The cynicism of todays G.O.P. could not have been more vividly displayed than when Marco Rubio, John Kasich (a decent guy) and Ted Cruz all declared that they would support the partys nominee, even if it was Trump, right after telling voters he was a con man. No wonder so many Republicans are voting for Trump on the basis of what they think is in his guts. All the other G.O.P. candidates have none.But even if his support is weakening, Democrats take Trump lightly at their peril. He is still sitting with three aces that he hasnt played yet. They could all come out in the general election.One ace is that if he wins the nomination he will have no problem moving to the center to appeal to independents and minorities. He will have no problem playing the moderate unifier  and plenty of people will buy it, saying: Why not give him a chance? He says he can make us winners. Sure, Mexico will have to pay for that wall, Trump will say, but it will be in installments. Deport 11 million illegal immigrants? Cmon, dont you know an opening bid on an immigration bill when you hear one? Ban all Muslims? Well of course we cant ban a whole faith community, but Trump will vow to be much harder on visas from certain countries. Have you never read The Art of the Deal?His second ace is that given the position he staked out on terrorism, if, God forbid, there is a major terrorist attack on our soil between now and Election Day, Trump will reap enormous political benefits. Watch out. Ive seen how one well-timed terrorist attack tilted an Israeli election.His third ace is that he will indeed go after Hillary Clinton in ways you never heard before and that will delight and bring back a lot of disaffected Republicans, whose hatred of Hillary knows no bounds. Did you hear what Trump said about Hillary last night? That she was Bills enabler! Finally! I will vote for him just for that. Again, beware.But Trump is also holding two jokers with those aces. One of the lessons I learned covering the Middle East is that the only good thing about extremists is that they dont know when to stop  and in the end, they often do themselves in. See: Saddam Hussein.Trump has already gone places no candidate ever has, even telling us he has a big penis. One day he may go too far (if he hasnt already) and sever his gut connection with voters. Trumps other joker is that among those attracted to his gut are racists and fascists with a taste for violence at his rallies. One day they may go too far and do something so ugly, so brownshirt, it will also turn people off to his gut.In short, only Trump can trump Trump. Dont count on it, but dont count it out."}
{"text": "Whats the deal with American politics right now?This is an odd question for me to try to answer. I write and talk about money, not politics. But this year, its the question I hear most often when I travel to other countries. They want to know if I can shed any light on whats happening in our presidential race.Im as shocked as everyone else by what is going on. But as I have thought about it, I keep coming back to this great insight from the investing guru Benjamin Graham: In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.The same logic holds true for democracy. In the short term, how markets move and whom we elect depends on humans casting ballots in a voting machine  buying stocks or making a choice in the voting booth. The results we see represent nothing more than the collective feelings of all those humans  at that moment. At any given time were voting for stocks or politicians based on imperfect information and a very complex set of mental and emotional biases. These are all things that make it incredibly difficult to reach a rational decision.But in the midst of all this angst about what to do or think right now, we can better navigate the messy short term by considering what we want to happen long term. In the long term, we know that markets and elections become the weighing machines that Mr. Graham described. They smooth out the extreme emotions of any one moment and reflect the underlying value of our bigger systems, capitalism and democracy.So we ought to take a step back from whats happening right now and add some time to our outlook, say 15 to 20 years. We need to find a way to balance the emotion were feeling right now with what wed like to see decades from now. I know that it makes a big difference when it comes to investing, and it stands to reason that it applies to politics, too.When Winston Churchill said, Democracy is the worst form of government ever created by the mind of man, except for all the others, he could have been talking about investing in free capital markets, too. All of the fear and risk and volatility add up to the worst possible way to reach financial goals ever created  except for all the others. Still, our investing and electoral systems make more sense when we nudge ourselves into looking past short-term emotions and biases.For instance, it already seems like the race for president has lasted forever. But it hasnt even been a year since Donald Trump rode down an escalator and ushered in the reality show were now watching. We need to remember that in our democratic republic, even a four- or eight-year presidency is still short term.Our country is filled with people experiencing frustration, fear and anger. Why not blow up the whole system? At least it would be entertaining, right? But we owe it to ourselves and to the bigger systems to balance how were feeling in the short term against what wed like to see a decade or two from now.It might help to imagine your personal worst-case situation for 2016. Does a President Trump or Sanders mean you will stop believing in democracy? Probably not. You will still vote in the next election and the one after that because you understand the value of the bigger system. So based on your belief in the bigger system, whats the best possible vote you can cast this time around?Im still not sure how to explain whats happening in American politics. How were all feeling now may look nothing like how we feel four years from, even if we are trying to Trump-proof our portfolios. In the short term, markets will continue to move, politics will continue to look like a circus and well continue to be human and make decisions based on how we feel. But in the long term, history has proved that both the markets and our political system will stretch to accommodate most of our feelings."}

{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  These are anxious days in the land of start-ups. Another few months of tight money and the entrepreneurs and venture capitalists will be feeling real pain.The sooner the better, some people here say.Cities do not usually cheer the downfall or even the diminishment of the hometown industry, but the relationship between San Francisco and the tech community has grown increasingly tense.Two years ago, radicals began delaying and harassing Google and other tech companies shuttles as they threaded San Franciscos narrow streets. Now  after the city officially gave the shuttles free rein to use public bus stops; after the tech elite were accused of trying to buy a crucial local election; after the home-rental company Airbnb spent a fortune to defeat a proposition that would have restricted its business  the discontent is mainstream.In December, 39 percent of Bay Area adults said they thought things in California were headed in the wrong direction, up from 29 percent a year earlier, according to surveys by the Public Policy Institute of California. In Los Angeles, by contrast, the percentage expressing general disapproval fell from 37 percent in 2014 to 33 percent in 2015.Its practically a ubiquitous sentiment here: People would like a little of the air to come out of the tech economy, said Aaron Peskin, perhaps the most prominent leader of the opposition. Theyre like people in a heat wave waiting for the monsoon.Mr. Peskin, a combative presence on the citys board of supervisors a decade ago, was the underdog when he sought to reclaim his seat last fall against an incumbent backed by both Mayor Edwin M. Lee and the tech establishment. But he drew volunteers from all over the city and won by a 9-point margin with the slogan Lets take a stand to make San Francisco more affordable and livable.These billion-dollar companies should help ameliorate the impact theyre having, Mr. Peskin said. They can afford to do a lot more. So far, its only window-dressing. They can volunteer to be decent.During the late 1990s dot-com boom, the office parks of Silicon Valley were another world to most San Franciscans, a place somewhere to the south that they needed never go. But increasingly Silicon Valley is rooted in the city itself, which makes it inescapable.The consequences for people who do not make their living from technology are increasingly unpleasant. The city is bulging at the seams, adding about 10,000 people a year to a record 852,000 in 2014. A one-bedroom apartment goes for a median $3,500 a month, the highest in the nation.For every person who moves to San Francisco, another two start commuting to work here. Traffic is down to a crawl: The average afternoon speed on the roads feeding into the highways has dropped 20 percent in the last two years. And the BART trains are squeezed tight: Since 2012, average morning rush-hour ridership from the East Bay has risen 30 percent.Signs of distress are plentiful. The Fraternite Notre Dames soup kitchen was facing eviction after a rent increase of nearly 60 percent. (It was saved for a year after its plight received worldwide publicity.) Two eviction-defense groups were evicted in favor of a start-up that intended to lease the space to other start-ups. The real estate site Redfin published a widely read blog post that said the number of teachers in San Francisco who could afford a house was exactly zero.All the renters I know are living in fear, said Derrick Tynan-Connolly, a teacher at a high school for pregnant teenagers and young mothers. If your landlord dies, if your landlord sells the building, if you get evicted under the Ellis Act  a controversial law that allows landlords to reclaim a building by taking it off the rental market  and you have to move, youre gone. Theres no way you can afford to stay in San Francisco.Mr. Tynan-Connolly, 52, first came to San Francisco three decades ago, when its origins as a working-class port were still in evidence. The city was a haven of political and sexual tolerance unlike any in America. Now, he and many others feel, it has become something much narrower: a haven for the wealthy.The city has the largest budget it ever had, he said. But the homeless are still suffering while working-class families, including my students, struggle to find affordable housing and child care. Where are the benefits from the boom that are accruing to the whole city?San Francisco has a budget of $8.6 billion and a deficit of $100 million, according to Mayor Lee, who ordered city departments to cut spending by 1.5 percent. The mayor, who did not face any significant opposition for re-election in November, did not have time to be interviewed, a spokeswoman said.Sentiment is difficult to gauge on a citywide scale. The demonstrations against the shuttles got widespread attention, but quickly petered out. Mr. Tynan-Connolly noted that the long history of activism in San Francisco was driven by young people, and now the young people often work for the tech companies.The Airbnb proposition, which would have placed some limitations on short-term rentals in the city, was defeated by voters, but the $25 billion start-ups victory prompted a backlash. The Internet Archive, which tracks political ads, said 1,959 minutes of airtime were devoted to opposing the measure. In support: 16 minutes. That mismatch fueled claims that tech money is in control of the city.Some tech folks think things are out of kilter.There are valid concerns that San Francisco is becoming a plutocracy, said Donna Burke, an entrepreneur and investor. Silicon Valley traditionally valued changing the world over money. We need to get back to that ethos.None of the San Franciscans interviewed for this article said they wished any harm to tech workers, but they lamented what they saw as a high degree of cluelessness.I have a lot of friends who work in those companies, and they literally encourage me every week to quit my job and do what theyre doing, said Helana Corda, who teaches sixth graders at a public middle school, is a part-time bartender and works at a program for disadvantaged children. They think theyre trying to help, but I feel slightly offended.Tech people regularly issue electronic broadsides that irk San Franciscans. The latest came in late February from a start-up founder, Justin Keller, who complained about the homeless and riffraff.The wealthy working people have earned their right to live in the city, he wrote in an open letter, adding: I shouldnt have to see the pain, struggle and despair of homeless people to and from my way to work every day. (He later said using the word riffraff was insensitive.)Even those who have benefited from the tech workers and their free-spending ways say something is amiss.I like a boom. Im a fan of this boom, said Craig Stoll, co-owner of Pizzeria Delfina and other popular restaurants. I think its exciting times in San Francisco. I like the influx of people. But it comes with problems. A lot of our cooks dont live in the city. They cant afford it.Good times do not mean things automatically get better for institutions that were here first. We feel the competition, Mr. Stoll said. We didnt really feel it in the past. There are a lot more restaurants now.The issue of the shuttles, the first flash point between San Franciscans and the tech community, was never resolved. The city started charging the companies a small fee. Politicians and the companies are trying to work out a permanent fix, possibly involving the use of hubs to pick up passengers.In the meantime, some shuttles use a city stop in front of Synergy, a private school in the Mission district, to pick up and let off workers. Traffic enforcement keeps a watchful eye. Several parents who inadvertently ventured into the bus zone got $279 tickets.For Jilanne Hoffmann, like many Synergy parents, every morning flirts with disaster: It seems only a matter of time before a child is hit. A petition has been submitted to the city in an effort to get the stop moved.It scares me to want to damage the economy of the Bay Area in any way  youve got to be careful what you wish for, right? But I think we need a moratorium on the things that benefit the few, Ms. Hoffmann said. If only there were some way to prevent the haves from having it all."}
{"text": "Serena Williams may soon become the richest endorser in womens tennis, if only by default.Williams frequently comes in second to Sharapova on lists of the highest-paid female athletes. But Sharapova now faces a suspension and loss of sponsorship from several companies after she announced Monday that she had tested positive for meldonium, a banned substance.Williams would not second-guess Nike, her own longtime endorser, for re-examining its relationship with Sharapova.Theyre successful. They make their own decisions, Williams said Tuesday before an exhibition match at Madison Square Garden against Caroline Wozniacki. They obviously know how to make decisions.Williams and Sharapova have been two of Nikes most visible spokeswomen in recent years. Last year, Sharapova reportedly earned $23 million in endorsements, while Williamss total was around $13 million. Sharapova has won five major titles to Williamss 21. Nike, along with TAG Heuer and Porsche, quickly suspended ties with Sharapova after her news conference Monday.Williams expressed surprise at Sharapovas announcement.Like everyone else, most people were surprised and shocked, she said. But most people are happy with the fact she was upfront with what she had done in terms of what she had neglected. With that being said, shes taking responsibility, which she was ready to do.While sympathetic toward Sharapova, Williams did not ask tennis officials to extend any special treatment toward her. She also did not think Sharapova, a Russian, would face unfairly harsh treatment as a female player. Sharapova is, by far, the most prominent female tennis player to test positive for a performance-enhancing drug.In sport and in life, theres always a double standard, Williams said. Everyone knows that, whether its a race thing or sex thing. However, this is a different thing. As Maria said, shes ready to take responsibility. And that takes courage and heart.Sharapova, who will be provisionally suspended from all tennis tournaments beginning Saturday, could face anything from a slap on the wrist to a long ban. Sharapova said that she had failed to check the updated banned substances list for 2016, which included meldonium for the first time. Sharapova said she had taken the drug for health reasons since 2006.According to Wozniacki, it is unusual for a player not to be up-to-date on the banned list.Anytime we take any medication, we double- and triple-check, Wozniacki said. Sometimes even a thing like cough drops and nasal spray can be on the list. So as athletes we make sure not to take something that would put us in a bad situation.Based on Sharapovas admission, Williams played against her quite often while Sharapova was using the drug. Williams has defeated Sharapova 18 times in a row and would not say Tuesday that she faced a disadvantage in any of those matches.I dont think Im the best person to ask that question, Williams said.It was a day of celebration and reflection among tennis insiders, still trying to digest Sharapovas announcement. The International Tennis Hall of Fame announced that Justine Henin, a Belgian, and Marat Safin, Russian, would be inducted in July, becoming the first players from their nations to attain that status.Henin faced Sharapova 10 times from 2005 to 2010, defeating her in seven of those matches.Its not nice what happened, Henin said. Not good for the game and not good for Maria at the moment. Were not in position to judge. Some questions need to be asked, and its hard to give an opinion. But rules have to be followed.Safin said he hoped that Sharapovas admission about meldonium was a technical mistake.I dont think its intentional, he said. I want to believe so."}
{"text": "After years of seeing United Continental struggle, two hedge funds have begun an insurrection against the airlines board  and have turned to a well-regarded figure from the companys past to lead the charge.In picking Gordon M. Bethune, who as chief executive of Continental during the 1990s led that companys last turnaround, as one of six director nominees announced on Tuesday, the investors are hoping to highlight what they argue are continued operational problems at one of the countrys biggest airlines.The looming board fight posed by the two hedge funds, Altimeter Capital Management and PAR Capital Management, comes at an awkward time for United.The airline named a new chief executive in September after the surprise dismissal of Jeff Smisek during a corruption investigation involving officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But shortly after his appointment, the new chief, Oscar Munoz, had a heart attack and was hospitalized for a heart transplant. He is scheduled to return to work full time on Monday.The saber-rattling on Tuesday followed months of discussions with Uniteds board. People close to United said that the airline had been willing to explore potential compromises, including the extension of a Friday deadline to nominate directors, to allow for more time for talks. They added that the company was willing to consider some of the hedge funds candidates.But the point of resistance was over the hedge funds insistence that Mr. Bethune be made nonexecutive chairman, according to people briefed on the discussions.The prospect of a proxy fight  one that could still be averted if the two sides can reach a settlement  comes after years of trouble at United, the product of a 2010 merger of United and Continental that has run into turbulence.Since then, United has lagged its rivals in the industry. The combination has been dogged by computer and technical problems and the worst operational and on-time performance among big carriers. Differences in corporate cultures and labor disagreements have thwarted a unified approach in the companys operations.Shares of United, while doubling since 2013, have underperformed those of other airlines. Shares of Delta Air Lines, for example, have quadrupled over the same time period. On Tuesday, United shares fell 2.2 percent, to $56.34.Neither Altimeter nor PAR, which together own just over 7 percent of Uniteds shares, has run an activist shareholder campaign before. But the two focus on investing in transportation companies. They contend that they were forced to act after months of talks failed to lead to changes in how the company is run. In a public letter to the companys directors published on Tuesday, the hedge funds derided the current board as underqualified, ineffective, complacent and entrenched.Not even Uniteds addition of three new directors, including a former chief operating officer of Delta and a former chief executive of T. Rowe Price, and the promise of a fourth new director changed the hedge funds minds. The investors called the move a transparent and cynical attempt to maintain the boards power.We have no more confidence that you will act responsibly in the future (even with yesterdays announcement) than we have evidence that you have done so in the past, Brad Gerstner, the chief executive of Altimeter, and Paul A. Reeder, the chief executive of PAR, wrote in the letter.Henry L. Meyer III, Uniteds nonexecutive chairman, replied in a statement, We are deeply disappointed that after United attempted to engage in a constructive, good-faith dialogue with PAR and Altimeter, repeatedly communicated our willingness to make meaningful changes in our board, publicly announced our intention to name four new independent directors with deep relevant experience and named three of them yesterday, PAR and Altimeter have unilaterally taken this hostile action with no concern that a proxy fight could distract the company from executing on Oscars strategic plan.Some analysts supported the idea of overhauling Uniteds board.As for the more strenuous board revamp proposed by Par and Altimeter, we say bravo  go for it, Vicki Bryan, an analyst with the research firm Gimme Credit, wrote in a note. We certainly view a move to smarter, more credible leadership with stronger accountability as long overdue and acutely needed for this board  and a fresh slate of qualified directors plus a new chairman to boot could do it.In an interview, Mr. Bethune said he had agreed to join the slate to become nonexecutive chairman for two years to help the board set clear goals and motivate employees. He said that before Uniteds latest nominations, the companys board lacked directors with experience running an airline.Mr. Bethune wrote a book called From Worst to First, about his experience transforming Continental Airlines. He said United needed to perform better than its three main rivals: Delta, American and Southwest.They need to beat the competition, he said. If youre in a horse race and youre in fourth place, youre not winning.I am willing to help, he said. And I do know the front end from the back of an airplane, and that would be a novel experience for the board.The former executive, who is 74, said age would not be an issue despite the companys mandatory retirement age of 75. The board, he said, could simply extend the limit for one year to allow him to stay on.Mr. Bethune, who is serving on the boards of three companies  Honeywell, Prudential and Sprint  plans to retire from two of them this year but will remain on the board of Sprint. When he ran Continental, he appointed both Mr. Munoz and Mr. Meyer, the current chairman of United, to the airlines board.I dont need this, said Mr. Bethune, who added that United employees were demoralized and he wanted to help. There is nothing wrong with the people. They just need leadership. And they dont have it.Mr. Munoz, who has no previous airline management experience before United, came from the railroad operator the CSX Corporation, where he was chief operating officer. Mr. Munoz had been a director at United and, before that, Continental.He and the board can count on the support of the airlines flight attendants, as well as its largest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which both released statements on Tuesday backing Mr. Munoz.The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents 24,000 employees, said the shareholders were creating a distraction at just the wrong time."}
{"text": "Just as Act I of Richard Greenbergs play Our Mothers Brief Affair is about to end, Anna Cantors secret paramour confesses that the name she knows him by, Phil Weintraub, is actually a pseudonym.Who are you? she asks tentatively.Phil holds Anna tight. David Greenglass, he whispers.Suddenly the action stops, and the lights go up. Annas two grown children, Abby and Seth, step to the front of the stage and address the audience.For those of you who know who David Greenglass is or was, we congratulate you on your historical memory, Abby says.For those of you who are thinking, Oy vey, again with the Rosenbergs, our apologies, Seth says.For the whole story, Abby continues, I refer you to Sam Robertss excellent account of the case, The Brother. On opening night in January, I almost jumped out of my seat. Im no math whiz, but I could project potential book sales: 650 seats in the Samuel J. Friedman Theater, eight performances weekly, six weeks before completing its limited run. (The play closed on Sunday.) All without having even met the playwright.My wife immediately nudged me back to earth. This is not Hamilton,  she said. Youre not Ron Chernow.Still, when I was invited to the show by the Manhattan Theater Club, I was just as unsuspecting as Anna Cantor. All I was told was that the play had something to do with my book, The Brother. I was completely unprepared for Phil Weintraubs revelation and for what happened next.So was the audience. How many had heard of David Greenglass, much less met him, as I had? Which is why Abby and Seth interrupted the action to nimbly recap the Rosenberg case:David was an Army machinist working on the atomic bomb at Los Alamos during World War II. His sister, Ethel Rosenberg, and her husband, Julius, persuaded him to spy for the Soviet Union. Confronted years later by the F.B.I., he implicated the Rosenbergs to spare his wife from prosecution and himself from the death penalty. The couple were convicted of espionage conspiracy, in part because of his perjured testimony, and were executed.But how did my book become a plot twist  and, in the finale to Act II, an actual physical prop? I waited until the play closed so that twist was no longer ripe for spoiling  to reveal the answer here. A friend had told Mr. Greenberg years ago about a womans indelible guilty secret. He was mulling it as the basis for a play.Then I read your book, he told me, and it overlapped. I decided that I wanted to put them together. The really idiotic part was I didnt realize they had incredible parallels.The conceit of the play is that were never sure whether Anna, played by Linda Lavin, had her brief affair with Phil or with David.Did she conjure Greenglass during one of her periodic deathbed scenes to gain a measure of celebrity? (Seth writes obituaries for a living, oddly, as I do now: Creative writers are always running out of material, Anna tells Seth. You never will, will you?) Or, did she invoke that singular historic figure to assuage her own guilt about a secret?Annas secret was the story Mr. Greenberg had heard from his friend: One night, a self-absorbed young girl pretended not to hear her sweet, sick sister ask for a glass of water in the bedroom they shared. Three days later, the sister died.So maybe, Seth speculates, to ease her guilt, his mother turned this random lover into the necessary lover?But when Phil/David prescribes self-forgiveness, the parallel between denying your sister a drink and sending her to the electric chair appalls Seth. May I, at this moment, he says, bring up the concept of scale?Mr. Greenberg originally called his play My Mothers Brief Affair With David Greenglass, but figured that the title might betray his plot. Still, much of his potential audience wasnt alive when the Rosenbergs were executed in 1953.Ms. Lavin was, but even she didnt recognize Greenglasss name at first. Nor did Greg Keller, who plays Seth. (Barney Greengrass, Mr. Keller said, referring to the Upper West Sides self-proclaimed sturgeon king, I knew well.) Even to Anna, Phils revelation rings only a dim bell.David Greenglass? she asks. From P.S. 12? The nose-picker?In 1960, when Mr. Greenglass was released after nearly 10 years in federal prison, he expressed one goal. All I want, he said, is to be forgotten. Yet for anyone who did remember, his name became synonymous with the betrayal of a sister.Mr. Greenberg was reminded of that by my book. (As were John Hancock and Dorothy Tristan a decade ago, when they adapted The Brother largely as a two-hander, a meeting of subject and reporter. Observing myself as an observer was even weirder than watching Mr. Greenbergs play.)This seminal Cold War story is also about family dysfunction, about ordinary people suddenly exposed by faith and by fate upon a world stage. Some soared. Most foundered.Greenglass happened into the most profound kind of exposure, and thats what fascinated me about using him, Mr. Greenberg said. Thats what underlies most of us: a gift for not being tested.Or, as Anna says magnanimously: He was just a boy from the neighborhood. He meant well.So with whom did Anna have the affair, Phil or David?By me, it was David, Mr. Greenberg said. Ive decided, in the real world, no, but in the real world of the play, yes.In the end, does it matter? There was enough guilt and betrayal to go around. As Anna admits, David was sometimes fast-and-loose with the truth. Its a characteristic of spies, she says. And lovers."}
{"text": "Shruthi Aramandlas education and her job are geared to New York Citys skyline. She did not want to go back to her native India and start all over again.Ms. Aramandla, 24, who has a masters degree from the  Tandon School of Engineering at New York University, has been waiting anxiously for the federal government to publish its new rule on a foreign-worker training program so she would know whether she could stay longer  and perhaps one day permanently  in the United States.The federal government will publish the rule on Friday, saying that international students earning degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields in the United States will now be eligible to stay for three years of on-the-job training. This is seven months longer than under the 2008 rule it replaces for the STEM Optional Practical Training program, known as OPT. The new rule will take effect on May 10.Beyond offering graduates more experience in their fields, the extension serves another purpose. If my work visa gets denied this year, I still have two more opportunities to apply, and I can keep working within the country, said Ms. Aramandla, who wanted to be an engineer since she was 10, growing up in Chennai, India. She graduated from N.Y.U. in May; under the previous 29-month rule, she would have been able to stay only through October 2017.Ms. Aramandla will apply in April for a visa, known as an H-1B, for so-called skilled foreign workers. But Congress caps those yearly at 65,000, with an additional 20,000 slots for graduates with advanced degrees like Ms. Aramandla. The government received nearly four times as many applications for those visas as were accepted in last years lottery.This rule is yet another flash point in the controversy over immigration reform. Industry leaders who say they are desperate for skilled talent and those defending the rights of American workers see the training programs extension as an end-around to stalled reform. But that is all they agree upon.Its an ongoing assault on American workers, said John Miano, a lawyer for a technology workers union in Washington State, whose lawsuit last summer was what forced the government to vacate the previous rule and create a new one, this time for public comment.They are just trying to double down on what theyre doing before, he said of the government. O.K., you didnt like 29 months? Well make it 36 months.Mr. Miano says his group, the Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, is still arguing the legality of the program in an appeal. The next hearing will be in May at the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.The government posted a similar version of the rule in the federal register in October, drawing more than 50,500 comments. (Death threats to President Obama were removed, officials said.) A large number of commenters who said they were foreign students supported the rule. But there were also comments from people who identified themselves as unemployed technology workers or concerned citizens who believed the government was destroying this country, and thought that it showed the government was standing with illegals.I hope you rip it up, one commenter said.The new rule states directly that a STEM OPT student would not replace a full- or part-time, temporary or permanent U.S. worker, and that the salary offered would be commensurate to American workers.Officials with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said they tried to tighten training programs, mandate oversight of employers and make sure that the students come from accredited universities in an effort to prevent fraud.In our mind, it enhances training and puts safeguards in to make sure that if you are an employer that you are not unfairly disadvantaging U.S. workers, Rachel Canty, deputy director for the agencys Student and Exchange Visitor Program.The agency said it would provide help sessions for eligible students, employers and academic institution on its website on Friday.Ms. Aramandla, who works for Loring Consulting Engineers and designs heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems for schools in New York, said her training would not be applicable in India, nor would she find the same work environment there; as a woman in India, she feels she would not be as respected as she is in the United States.Michael DesRochers, the president of Loring, said Ms. Aramandla was an integral employee in his technical work force, which is 7 percent foreign.The labor market is tight, Mr. DesRochers said. We dont look at it as the international students are taking away American opportunities. We feel were offering to all.His companys work may intersect again with the new rule: Recently, his engineers replaced the ventilation and mechanical systems for the United States Supreme Court."}
{"text": "Hillary Clinton is leading Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in Florida and Ohio, according to polls released on Wednesday that show him looking vulnerable going into next weeks primary contests.Losses in Ohio and Florida, where there are a combined 405 delegates at stake on March 15, could deal a significant blow to Mr. Sanderss campaign and increase pressure on him to consider dropping out of the race.A survey from Quinnipiac University shows Mrs. Clinton, the former secretary of state, dwarfing Mr. Sanders in Florida, with Democratic voters backing her by a margin of 62 percent to 32 percent.Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Sanders with most groups in Florida, and she is even tied with him among young voters, a demographic that has generally been favoring him.With less than a week until the actual voting, it is difficult to see a path to victory for him in the Sunshine State, said Peter Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University poll. He just has too much ground to make up and not enough time in which to do it.Despite the deep deficit in Florida, Mr. Sanders still stands a chance in Ohio, where he trails Mrs. Clinton 52 percent to 43 percent, according to a separate Quinnipiac poll.Very liberal voters, younger voters and men are keeping Mr. Sanders afloat there.The polls had margins of error of plus or minus four percentage points."}

At least nine firefighters were reported injured in the blast.The explosion, reported around 1:45 a.m. Pacific time, was so loud that it could be heard as far away as Shoreline, a community about 10 miles north of downtown Seattle.The police and firefighters descended on the scene, near the intersection of Greenwood Avenue North and 85th Avenue North, in Greenwood, a neighborhood in the north-central part of the city.The blast shook the neighborhood, which is known for its concentration of restaurants, bars and coffee shops and has of late been home to middle-class families and upscale professionals.According to the news website seattlepi.com, the explosion leveled two buildings, one of them a convenience store, and blew out several windows of nearby buildings.The Fire Department said that 67 employees were sent to the scene.The television station KING said that a natural gas leak had been reported about 40 minutes before the explosion.

{"text": "Times Insider delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how news, features and opinion pieces come together at The New York Times. In this piece, writer Louis Bayard describes what it was like to write The Timess Downton Abbey recaps.No! It was the right cheek!Season 5, Episode 6 of Downton Abbey had just played out across Americas TV screens. My recap had gone online, and the fun was getting underway.Thats because, in one of the shows key plot developments, Thomas Barrow, the sporadically evil underbutler, had undergone a quack regimen to cure himself of homosexuality and had developed a nasty abscess on his ...There was the rub.You see, I remembered seeing the lesion on his left buttock. But within minutes of my blog going live, a swarm of commenters (and emailers and Facebook posters) rose up with one voice to flag my error.Right cheek!Its one thing to hear America singing; its quite another to hear it fact-checking. But the Great Buttock Controversy of 2015, in addition to producing one of the more amusing corrections in The Timess recent history, reinforced for me just how closely Downton viewers were watching  and just how ardently they felt about getting it right. Or left.Its in the nature of fandom, of course, to crouch protectively over a beloved program. But I would argue that the Downton passion is unique in that it admits any manner of opposed feelings  impatience, hilarity, agnosticism, scorn, bafflement  and still thrives and still endures.The assignment to recap Downton Abbey fell into my lap (thats very much how it felt) in December 2014, about two weeks before the fifth season began. I honestly wondered if I was the right person for the job. Like many viewers, I had gobbled up the first season, hung on through the next two and then begun to drift sometime after the death of Matthew Crawley. (There should be a moniker for this phenomenon: the Crawley Crawl? the Matthew Malaise?) So recapping the show meant more than just catching up; it meant coming to grips with what I really thought about Julian Fellowess creation.In the old days, I would try to sell the show to skeptical friends by saying it was a soap opera BUT. As in: BUT it has a superb cast and gorgeous production values and ingenious pacing and genuinely witty lines.However, as I began to sift through the great tangled weave of Lord Fellowess plot threads, I had to acknowledge an inverse truth. BUT  it was still a soap opera. (Quite literally a soap opera, in one instance: That malevolent domestic, OBrien, managed to end an entire dynasty by placing a wet bar of soap next to Lady Granthams tub. Out of all the possible places Lady G could have set her foot, she blindly and unerringly found that one location, thus falling and miscarrying her future heir. And if you think that level of plotting wouldnt get you laughed out of the average undergraduate fiction-writing workshop, youre wrong.)So, going in, I was clear about one thing: I would need to have some fun with this show.Of course, I didnt want to be a nattering nabob of negativism, so I made sure to throw in categories like Best Line and Best Scene to keep me on the side of the angels. And since I invariably had to research Mr. Fellowess allusions, I came up with I Google so you dont have to. Looking back, I can see I was just bracing myself against the backdraft of viewer rage: How dare you treat our show this way?I neednt have worried.The Downton Abbey viewers  the Abbots, as I called them  were completely on board from the start. Really, I think you could make a case that they are the least pious fan base in the world. (Dont believe me? Try getting snarky about Don Draper.) They knew exactly what kind of program they had on their hands. They had followed it through all its stages of silliness and excess and torpor  and, yes, its occasional moments of transcendence.Certainly they wanted to talk about what Maggie Smith had said or what Michelle Dockery was wearing. But I think, at bottom, they just wanted to assure each other: Its O.K. to be here. Its O.K. to love this show, warts and all.Indeed, one of the most heartening aspects of recapping Downton Abbey was seeing commenters take some open-ended question I had posed (e.g. Whats going to happen to Edith? Will Mary find love?) and not just pose an answer but run with it. If you go back to any column, you can find an hours worth of entertainment just reading the comments, which are a display of wit and literacy  and engagement  that any show would be proud to lay claim to. Recapping, in the end, is a collaboration. And from where I sit, the more the merrier.Till the gong calls us back, I wrote in my last recap. I sincerely hope it will."}
{"text": "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla.  A palpable sense of shock rippled through a courtroom here Wednesday morning when the former editor in chief of Gawker.com was shown in a videotaped deposition suggesting that almost anything goes when it comes to the newsworthiness of celebrities sex videos.The former editor, Albert J. Daulerio, a defendant in an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit brought by the retired wrestler Hulk Hogan, was asked by the plaintiffs lawyer where he drew the line when it came to posting videos of people having sex.Can you imagine a situation where a celebrity sex tape would not be newsworthy? asked the lawyer, Douglas E. Mirell.If they were a child, Mr. Daulerio replied.Under what age? the lawyer pressed.Four.Gawker said later in a statement that Mr. Daulerio was being flippant.Still, the exchange highlighted the way that Gawkers culture of reporting on some of the most intimate aspects of the lives of celebrities and prominent newsmakers was being put on trial.Mr. Daulerios testimony took place during depositions taken last year in advance of the trial, which began on Monday, in the suit by the retired wrestler, known in the proceedings by his legal name, Terry G. Bollea, against Gawker Media; its founder, Nick Denton; Mr. Daulerio; and others.Mr. Bollea is seeking $100 million in damages, saying that amounts to the harm he suffered after Gawker posted in 2012 a secretly recorded video showing him having sex with a friends wife.The case is prompting significant questions about how far First Amendment rights stretch in an era when the unregulated Internet is ripe for abuse by anyone with a computer.In addition, testimony this week by Mr. Daulerio and other current and former members of Gawkers staff has raised a curtain on the culture of the website and others like it that traffic in salacious fare in an effort to gain readers.Asked whether sex sells, Mr. Daulerio replied, Im sure.In such a culture, he went on, it was pretty standard operating procedure to seize upon and publish photographs and videos of celebrities in compromising or intimate situations, regardless of whether the celebrity might object or be embarrassed. Mr. Daulerio conceded that no such consideration guided Gawkers publication of lewd images of the former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre or of photographs of a topless Duchess of Cambridge.Shes a public figure, and those pictures were published elsewhere, Mr. Daulerio said, referring to the duchess, the former Kate Middleton. He acknowledged that there had been no discussion in the Gawker newsroom at the time whether the publication of the pictures constituted an invasion of her privacy.Similar thinking, Mr. Daulerio said, dictated the sites handling of the video of Hulk Hogan, which he noted had been provided anonymously to him in the mail and for which no money had changed hands.I was very enthusiastic about writing about it, Mr. Daulerio said. He explained that he had enjoyed watching the video and was eager to attach his commentary to it on the site.I found it very amusing, he said. I thought it was newsworthy, and it was something that was worth publishing.In response to a question from Mr. Mirell, the defendant said that neither he nor anyone else at Gawker had made any attempt to contact Mr. Bollea to ask him whether he was in fact the man in the grainy video, and how he felt about Gawkers intention of publishing it.You didnt really care, did you? Mr. Mirell suggested.No, Mr. Daulerio said.A moment later, after an objection from a lawyer for Gawker, Mr. Mirell persisted. So its fair to say that whether he suffered emotional distress or not, that played no part in your decision whether or what to publish, he said.Correct, Mr. Daulerio replied.Videotaped testimony by his boss, Mr. Denton, was also shown to the jury, later in the day, even though the two men were sitting behind their lawyers in the courtroom. The plaintiffs use of taped depositions at this early stage of the trial seemed intended to stave off cross-examinations by the defense, which might reduce the impact of their words on the videos. Both defendants, however, are on their own legal teams list of witnesses, to be called to the stand when it is the defenses turn to present evidence at the trial.Under questioning in the deposition, recorded in October 2013, Mr. Denton said that contrary to Mr. Daulerios feelings, he had not been very excited by news that Gawker had received a video showing Hulk Hogan having sex with a woman on a four-poster bed. We all have sex, Mr. Denton said, noting that he preferred stories that had some kind of meaning.Nevertheless, Mr. Denton did not impede the videos publication, although he advised his editor not to put up the whole tape. A video editor cut it to 1 minute 41 seconds, from roughly 30 minutes.Asked whether he or his staff had looked into the tapes provenance, Mr. Denton demurred. We cant always determine the circumstances in which a film was made, he said.A letter from a lawyer for Mr. Bollea, asking Gawker to take down the video shortly after it had been posted, wasnt persuasive, Mr. Denton said. We continued to believe in its newsworthiness.The video remained on the site for about six months, until a court ordered its removal. Lawyers for Mr. Bollea said they had no intention of showing the tape to the jury during the trial."}
{"text": "This weeks GIF science lesson might give you a newfound appreciation for how simple it is for most humans to consume a shrimp cocktail.No, this tiny aquatic creature is not that multi-headed sea beast of Greek mythology that regenerates a head every time some daring hero chops it off. It doesnt even have a head. But like the mythical hydra, the real hydra does regenerate, which is why scientists have been studying it for decades. Over time, researchers have learned one fact creepy enough to fuel nightmares: Every time this pond-dweller wants to eat  for example a little brine shrimp  it rips a hole through the center of its bodys outer layer. When dinner is done, it closes back up.Researchers have been aware of the hydras unusual mouth for quite some time. But the GIF above, pulled from a 25 second video clip published Tuesday by biophysicists at the University of California, San Diego, helps show whats going on at the cellular level.Just seconds after the researchers applied a chemical present in shrimp, the hydra detected the possible snack and ripped open a mouth. Later, the mouth sealed back up so the hydra could digest.It looks a little bit like the control of the pupil in the human eye, said Eva-Maria Collins, who led the research team, noting that the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems control dilation of the pupil.When a human detects a threat, the sympathetic nervous system prepares the body to respond, dilating the pupils to help see better. In the absence of the threat, the parasympathetic nervous system brings the pupil back to normal. Dr. Collins thinks the hydra opens and closes its mouth for food by a similar process."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, is to meet with President Obama on Thursday for the first official visit by a Canadian leader in 19 years, a diplomatic honor made possible in part by new pledges of cooperation on combating climate change.Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau are expected to announce new commitments to reduce planet-warming emissions of methane, a chemical contained in natural gas that is about 25 times as potent as carbon dioxide, and which can leak from drilling wells and pipelines.That announcement will come during a day of ceremony that will conclude with a state dinner in the East Room of the White House. On the menu is Alaskan halibut casseroles, roasted apricot galette, baby lamb chops with Yukon Gold potato dauphinoise and a maple pecan cake with cocoa nib wafer and butterscotch swirl ice cream.The arrival of Mr. Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Grgoire Trudeau, has prompted comparisons to a similar visit in 1977 by Pierre Trudeau, a former prime minister and the current leaders father. That visit made headlines when Margaret Trudeau, the prime ministers wife, wore a short dress that fell just below the knee to the White House state dinner.While Canada and the United States have long been close allies, Mr. Obamas efforts to confront global warming had become a major point of contention with Mr. Trudeaus predecessor, Stephen Harper, who sought to aggressively expand Canadas oil industry.As Mr. Obama became more determined to leave behind a lasting environmental legacy, he delayed and eventually rejected construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported nearly a million barrels a day of heavily polluting oil from Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast.Mr. Obamas rejection of the pipeline severely strained relations with Mr. Harper.But Mr. Trudeaus election last year marked a shift in policy that was welcomed by the White House. Mr. Trudeau did not criticize Mr. Obamas rejection of the pipeline, and has pledged to pursue an ambitious environmental agenda intended to coordinate with Mr. Obamas policies.In December, Canadian officials helped to push through a historic global climate agreement in Paris.The climate relationship with Canada really just ramped up dramatically quickly, Todd Stern, Mr. Obamas special envoy for climate change, told reporters ahead of Mr. Trudeaus arrival.Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau will meet privately on Thursday to discuss military cooperation, efforts to combat terrorism, improvements in trade and environmental concerns.Among the issues the two leaders will seek to resolve is a dispute over several decades about softwood lumber. American officials say lumber from Canada is unfairly subsidized by the government there, an assertion that Canadian officials reject.Thats a longstanding and complicated issue, but we do welcome the Trudeaus government interest in discussing a new arrangement for softwood lumber, and were open to exploring all options with Canada to address this important trade issue, said Mark Feierstein, the senior director for the Western Hemisphere at the National Security Council.But the most anticipated topic is the environment.Prime Minister Trudeau is already showing serious, concrete commitment to accelerating progress on climate, Mr. Stern said. The commitment of both leaders to addressing this global challenge is clear. And I suspect under their leadership, North America will make significant progress this year and next.The Obama administration wants to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The Interior Department has proposed a number of regulations on methane leaks, but has yet to write a regulation governing such leaks from current oil and gas drilling on public land."}
{"text": "Jaws dropped Tuesday night as Bernie Sanders defied the embarrassingly incorrect polls and shocked election watchers with a narrow but important upset of Hillary Clinton in Michigan.The two candidates are likely to roughly split the delegates from the state, and Clinton actually increased her delegate lead for the evening because of her crushing victory in Mississippi. But there is no denying that Michigan is an enormous loss for the Clinton campaign, and a major psychological and momentum-gaining win for the Sanders campaign.Sanders benefits greatly from the passage of time  which hes running out of  and the electorates growing familiarity with him, his platform and his history that it allows.Neither of the candidates running for the Democratic nomination, who debate tonight, provides the bombast and sensationalism of the Republican candidates, especially the Republican front-runner, so ratings-hungry, shock-addicted television networks give them little coverage. They have to make their cases more the old-fashioned way: in person, on the ground, or by fanning out an army of surrogates.As I have been saying on social media, both Clinton and Sanders had electoral hurdles that they had to clear. Clintons was to win by large margins in states not in the Deep South that are reliably Democratic or that are swing states in the general election. Sanderss hurdle was to demonstrate that he could win in states where the portion of nonwhite Democratic primary voters was greater than a quarter of the whole.Only one person cleared his hurdle Tuesday: Bernie Sanders.The nonwhite portion of voters in Michigans Democratic primary, according to exit polls, was 30 percent. Furthermore, 21 percent was African-American. This is much smaller than the majority black vote in some Southern Democratic contests, but still sizable. More important, Sanders won a larger share of the black vote in Michigan than he had won in any of the Southern states for which there were exit polls.For instance, Sanders won just 11 percent of the black vote in Mississippi, but he won 28 percent of it in Michigan.Northern blacks and Southern blacks are most likely processing Sanders quite differently. As I wrote in a February column:There isnt one black America, but two: The children of the Great Migration and the children of those who stayed behind in the South. (Black immigrants are another story.) Having spent the first half of my life in the South and the second in Great Migration destination cities, I can attest that the sensibilities are as different as night and day.Sanderss early, Northern activism for racial equality is likely to have more resonance with Northern blacks, and so is his largely urban and non-Southern roster of black surrogates. For instance, more Michigan primary voters said they trusted Sanders more than Clinton to handle race relations in this country. The opposite was true in Mississippi.Part of this also has to do with what I call the political provincialism of the South: The favoring of regional candidates and the shunning of outsiders. Because of the time Clinton spent in the South, she has a Southern advantage.(It should be noted that this Southern provincialism crosses racial boundaries. Sanders won 31 percent of white vote in Mississippi, and 56 percent of it in Michigan.)But there was probably more at play in Michigan than just race.In the states where Sanders has campaigned hard, he has generally done well. He really committed time and resources in Michigan, and it paid off. Furthermore, his anti-trade deals position is likely to have held a particular resonance for that state, which was particularly hard hit by manufacturing job losses.And theres still more.Michigan had slightly more voters under 30 and slightly more male voters than the Southern states. This is an advantage for Sanders.The question now is what the Michigan results might portend for other Rust Belt states with large baskets of delegates, like Ohio and Illinois, and beyond that, what it might portend for the major delegate prizes of Florida, California and New York.Predictions are perilously dangerous this season, so Ill avoid them. Pundits keep getting this cycle wrong. But I will say this: The Michigan win put a new gust of wind into Sanderss sails and strengthened his argument that he is a very real and viable alternative to Clinton  and that he shouldnt feel one iota of pressure to leave the race before all the contests are finished.Clinton is a force, but Sanders is a phenomenon. They both bring a seriousness and gravitas to the presidential discussion that is sorely lacking on the Republican side. In that, Democrats can take some pride regardless which of them wins the nomination, because either would probably soundly defeat the current Republican front-runner. According to an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released this week, both Clinton and Sanders would handily defeat the real estate developer in a general election matchup.Now, with that in mind, we can all sit back and enjoy a Democratic nominating ride that just got infinitely more complicated and more interesting."}

Rents have skyrocketed and traffic has slowed to a crawl.Some of the logjams and excessive costs have gotten so bad that they are now pushing San Francisco residents to root for a downturn, writes David Streitfeld. Some San Franciscans are overt about this, while others are only privately wishing it to be so.People would like a little of the air to come out of the tech economy, Aaron Peskin, a member of San Franciscos board of supervisors, told Mr. Streitfeld. Theyre like people in a heat wave waiting for the monsoon.Its the latest sign that San Francisco has become an example of what-not-to-follow, despite its economic success as a tech hub.

{"text": "WARSAW  A political crisis in Poland entered a new and dangerous phase on Wednesday, as the countrys Constitutional Tribunal struck down a new law limiting its powers. The nations right-wing government, which adopted the law in December, said it would ignore the courts ruling.The legal showdown is the latest manifestation of a rightward lurch that began after the conservative Law and Justice Party swept to power in elections in October.The government is facing growing pressure from the European Union and the United States to respect the decisions of the Constitutional Tribunal, the only court empowered to review national laws. In January, the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, opened an unprecedented inquiry into whether the government had violated democratic norms, a condition of membership in the 28-nation bloc.Poland, which has the sixth-largest economy in the European Union, is a major net recipient of economic development aid. It is also a member of NATO and an American ally against an increasingly belligerent Russia.In about 20 cities across the country in the past two months, democratic activists have staged huge demonstrations against the government, which has also cracked down on the news media.But so far the government has remained defiant. Even before the court issued its latest ruling, Prime Minister Beata Szydlo had said her government would not abide by it.The constitutional crisis began in October. Sensing it was going to lose the elections, the previous party in power, Civic Platform, appointed five judges to the court, including two to fill terms that were not due to expire until after the election. The president refused to swear them in.Upon winning power, the Law and Justice Party appointed five judges of its own choosing, who were promptly sworn in. In December, however, the tribunal ruled that the old government had properly appointed three of the five judges it tried to install; the president has refused to seat them.Parliament then passed a law reorganizing the court, requiring a two-thirds majority for any decision to be binding, instead of a simple majority, and requiring that 13 of the 15 judges hear a given case, instead of nine. The decision announced on Wednesday was heard by only 12 judges, and the government argues that it is therefore not valid.This situation  described by the media as paralysis, which unfortunately is not far from the truth  means that fundamental constitutional principles have been abused, Judge Stanislaw Biernat, a member of the tribunal, said at the court on Wednesday.Judge Biernat said that the Law and Justice party  the first party since the fall of Communism in Poland in 1989 to hold an absolute majority in Parliament  had abused the rule of law, separation of powers, independence of the judiciary and the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals.The court also rejected the new two-thirds requirement as unconstitutional.The Constitution requires that the government publish all rulings by the Constitutional Tribunal immediately in the official Journal of Laws. The justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, said the prime minister would do no such thing.Mr. Ziobro said that the court appeared to have made up its mind before it even heard the case on Tuesday.This whole thing could have been a put-up job, he said. Its outrageous. The judges dont want to reach a compromise.The Constitution does not specify what should happen if a sitting government ignores a ruling of the Constitutional Tribunal.This will lead to a complete anarchy in our country, said Eugeniusz Klopotek of the opposition Polish Peoples Party. Social tensions will escalate. I can already feel it.Adam Bodnar, Polands human rights commissioner, told the tribunal during a hearing: The Constitutional Tribunal will survive, but the question is whether its function will not be purely decorative. This court guarantees the real protection of citizens rights and freedoms, but the Parliament intends to deprive citizens of this fundamental instrument to protect their rights.The ruling on Wednesday came just days before the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, a human rights watchdog, plans to issue a report on the status of political freedom in Poland, including the recent laws changing the powers of the Constitutional Tribunal and control of public broadcasters.According to a draft report, the commission will find that these changes endanger not only the rule of law, but also the functioning of the democratic system.Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who is the head of the Law and Justice Party and the power behind the prime minister, Ms. Szydlo, said Poland must stand up to external attempts to intervene in its internal affairs.Poland is and must be a sovereign country, Mr. Kaczynski said.If the European Union finds that Poland has violated democratic norms, it could strip the country of its voting rights, though it is not clear whether officials in Brussels will be willing to go that far."}
{"text": "When we hear a great recording, we tend to think of the music as having sprung fully developed from the imagination of the musician or band that cut the tracks. But that ignores the role of the producer, who translates the musicians vision into the sound we experience.The contributions that George Martin, who died Tuesday at 90, made to the Beatles recorded catalog were crucial, and although he was the first to say that most of the credit belongs to the band, many of the groups greatest songs owe their sound and character to his inspired behind-the-scenes work. Here are a few of his most telling musical fingerprints:When the Beatles turned up at EMIs studios on Abbey Road to record their third single, on March 5, 1963, they brought From Me to You, a short song that John Lennon and Paul McCartney had started writing less than a week earlier. Mr. Martin pondered the possibilities through the first four takes, and then proposed a solution for the songs two biggest problems, its brevity and lack of variety. After two verses, a bridge and a repeat of the first verse, the Beatles would play the verse yet again, this time with the first two lines as a short instrumental break, punctuated with the phrases from me (after the first line) and to you (after the second), before singing the final two lines. To fill out the break, Mr. Martin had Lennon play the songs melody on the harmonica, shadowed by Mr. McCartney on the bass.For the introduction, Mr. Martin experimented with a string of overdubs. In one, Lennon played the tune on the harmonica. In another, the group hummed it. They also sang it, twice using the syllables da-da-da, da-da, dun dun da, and once with a falsetto floating across the top. In the end, Mr. Martin chose a combination of the harmonica and the sung line (sans falsetto), which establishes the songs bright character immediately.Mr. McCartney first played Mr. Martin his classic torch song during the groups Paris residency in January 1964, so the producer had plenty of time to mull how to handle it. The group may have considered it, at first, as simply a ballad that would get the full-band treatment. But when Mr. McCartney decided to record it, during the Help! sessions in 1965, Mr. Martin proposed that Mr. McCartney accompany himself on an acoustic guitar, with a string quartet taking the place of the other Beatles.Mr. McCartney had his doubts: In his view, string arrangements on rock records were suspect. But Mr. Martin played him some recordings and sat him down at the piano to show him what could be done. In the end, Mr. McCartney was convinced, and Mr. Martin  typically open to the groups ideas  worked out his quartet arrangement with Mr. McCartney present. Mr. Martin has said, in fact, that one of the arrangements highlights  the descending cello line, after the lyric Im not half the man I used to be  was Mr. McCartneys idea.Mr. Martin began adding keyboard parts to the Beatles recordings virtually from the start, a notable early example being the ringing celesta line on Baby Its You. But the finest such contribution was his solo on In My Life, an autobiographical meditation by Lennon, on Rubber Soul. When the Beatles recorded the song, on Oct. 18, 1965, they left an instrumental verse open, to be filled with a solo, the nature of which was yet to be agreed upon. By Oct. 22, the group agreed to turn the solo over to Mr. Martin, who decided to give it a Bachian twist, writing a part that had the character and ornamentation of a Two-Part Invention.On his first pass, he used a Hammond organ but didnt care for the result. A piano worked better, but Mr. Martin, a functional but not virtuosic pianist, was unable to fully channel his inner Glenn Gould. So he played the master tape at half-speed, recording his part slowly and precisely. When the tape was played at full speed, the piano line was not only suitably crisp, but the speed change gave the instrument an unusual character  somewhere between that of a piano and a harpsichord, but not quite either.Strawberry Fields Forever, the first song recorded for the sessions that produced the Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band album, had as difficult a birth as any song the Beatles and Mr. Martin created. Lennon wrote this psychedelic dreamscape while filming How I Won the War in Almera, Spain, and recorded demos of all kinds  on acoustic guitar, electric guitar, with and without keyboard overdubs  before taking it to Abbey Road on Nov. 24, 1966. That night, the Beatles recorded a simple, short version with harmony vocals and a Mellotron approximation of a slide guitar, but they junked it two days later and started again, recording a tougher, tighter version with Mr. McCartney playing a fluty Mellotron introduction.Lennon didnt like that one either, and asked Mr. Martin to write an orchestral score. Mr. Martin responded with a hard-driven chamber score for brass and cellos. He sped the piece up, and moved the song to a higher key so that he could use the vibrant sound of the cellos lowest open string. On Dec. 8, the band and its symphonic friends recorded this third version, which also boasted a raucous timpani part, played by Mr. McCartney, and an Indian zither, played by George Harrison.Lennon liked it, briefly, and then he didnt. He told Mr. Martin that he enjoyed both the bands version and the chamber version, and envisioned a combination. Mr. Martin protested that the two were in different keys and at different tempos, but Lennon knew the extent of his producers magic, and said, You can do it, George. As it turned out, the key and tempo changes worked to Mr. Martins advantage: by slowing down the orchestral version and speeding up the band take, he found common ground without making either sound too unnatural. If you listen closely, you can spot his splice exactly one minute into the song.The song that closes Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, and is, for many listeners, the most astonishing track on an astonishing album, actually began as a pair of unrelated songs: The melancholy outer verses were Lennons, the brighter central section was Mr. McCartneys. What transformed these fragments into a cohesive whole is a touch of avant-garde string scoring by Mr. Martin. By the time the Beatles set to work on the track, on Jan. 19, 1967, they and Mr. Martin had mapped out its structure. Two of Lennons verses would open the song, followed by Mr. McCartneys verse, which would lead back to final thoughts from Lennon. Between the two composers sections, though, the band would vamp for 24 bars, and there would be another long vamp after the closing verse. How these would be filled  well, Mr. Martin would figure that out later.For several weeks, the group tweaked the main parts of the song, polishing the vocals, drums and bass, adding extra percussion parts, and trying to imagine what should occupy those long vamped sections. Mr. McCartney thought an orchestral section would be good, but left the question of what that should entail to his producer. Mr. Martins solution was to take a page out of the playbooks of classical composers like John Cage and Krzysztof Penderecki, who at the time were creating works in which chance played a role. Mr. Martin hired 40 symphonic musicians for a session on Feb. 10, and when they turned up, they found on their stands a 24-bar score that had the lowest notes on their instruments in the first bar, and an E major chord in the last. Between them, the musicians were instructed to slide slowly from their lowest to highest notes, taking care not to move at the same pace as the musicians around them.The sound was magnificently chaotic, and it became more so once Mr. Martin combined the four takes he recorded (some with Mr. McCartney on the podium, some conducted by Mr. Martin himself). It was a brilliant solution: as Lennons voice faded into the echoic distance, the orchestra began its buildup, ending sharply on the chord that begins Mr. McCartneys section."}

Grassley, the Iowa Republican who leads the panel bitterly divided over whether to take up President Obamas coming nominee, said on Wednesday that he expected a full-blown debate at the session. Democrats will no doubt be happy to oblige him.Democratic members of the panel, which would be the first stop for a nominee, have expressed their displeasure with Mr. Grassley, taking him to task for announcing that the committee would not take up any nomination. Mr. Grassley and his Republican colleagues have fought back with examples of how in past presidential election years top Democrats threatened to block high court nominees by Republican presidents.On Thursday, the combatants will be at close quarters for the discussion. An earlier business meeting scheduled for last week was canceled when Democrats objected to Mr. Grassleys proposal to hold it in a room off the Senate floor, which would have limited attendance from the news media and the public.It is very doubtful that anything will be settled at the session, but it will give both sides a chance to sharpen their arguments for what Mr. Grassley suggested will be a drawn-out dispute.Whether it is today or tomorrow or whether it is over the next seven or eight months, this is a very important debate we ought to have about the Constitution, he said."}
{"text": "We as a society derided the Roman Catholic Church as an accessory to child sexual abuse, and we lambasted Penn State for similar offenses.Yet we as a society are complicit or passive in a similar way, by allowing a popular website called Backpage.com to be used to arrange child rape. Consider what happened to a girl Ill call Natalie, who was trafficked into the sex industry in Seattle at age 15.It was every parents nightmare, Natalies mother, Nacole, told me. It can happen to any parent. Fifteen-year-olds dont make the best choices. I dropped her off at school in the morning, I was expecting to pick her up after track practice in the afternoon, and then I didnt see her for 108 days. The girl ran off to a bus station, was found by a pimp, and within days was being sold for sex on Backpage.Backpage has classified ads for everything from antiques to boats, but it makes its money on escort ads. It has about 80 percent of the U.S. market for online sex ads in America, mostly for consenting adults but many also for women who are forcibly trafficked or for underage girls. Children in at least 47 states have been sold on Backpage, by one aid groups count.We were an everyday, average family, Nacole said. Our children were involved in sports. She played the violin. She was on the soccer team. And she made a stupid decision one day that forever changed her life. And Backpage facilitated it.The girl was eventually rescued by the police, but by then she had been beaten and threatened by her pimp and endured innumerable rapes. Shes forever changed, her mom said. Her siblings are forever changed. Today she struggles with life.If there were a major American website openly selling heroin or anthrax, there would be an outcry. Yet we Americans tolerate a site like Backpage.com that is regularly used to peddle children. We avert our eyes, and the topic tends not to come up in polite society.I had no idea how much juvenile trafficking goes on until my family became a victim of it, Nacole said.Thousands of children are trafficked for sex each year in the United States, but there are no solid numbers. What is clear is only that its a big problem that gets minimal attention; its essentially never mentioned in the current political campaign.Yet a few forces are coming together to put pressure on Backpage. One is a  lawsuit in Washington State against Backpage by Natalie and two other girls who at age 13 were also sold on the website; one of the 13-year-olds said that she was raped 20 times a day.Another is decisive action by credit card companies to stop processing fees for sex ads on Backpage, disrupting its business model.Then there is the prospect that the Senate this month will adopt a Contempt of Congress resolution, the first by the Senate in 21 years (the last involved the Whitewater investigation), and this time its bipartisan and the target is Backpage. The aim is to force Backpage to comply with subpoenas from the Senates Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which is looking into the companys role in sex trafficking.Senator Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who leads the panel, told me that he expects the Senate to vote next week on the resolution and he doesnt know of anyone planning to vote against it.At a time when Congress seems gridlocked and dysfunctional, its nice to see the Senate moving in a bipartisan way to address an issue that affects Americas most vulnerable.The subcommittee has already uncovered disturbing information about Backpage, including the way it edits ads to reduce law enforcement scrutiny and does not retain photo data that could be used to find missing children. And Senate investigators uncovered an instruction to the Backpage staff that seemed to suggest erring on the side of letting girls be sold: only delete [ads] if you really very sure person is underage.The Senate panel found that Backpage was worth hundreds of millions of dollars and in 2014 had an Ebitda margin, a measure of profitability, of 82 percent, compared with an average of 9.3 percent for online services companies.Yiota Souras of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children notes that the issue is not adult prostitution or sex among consenting adults: Thats totally removed from what were focusing on here, which is children sold to be raped.Whatever we think about the presidential race, whatever our political party, we should be able to agree to act to stop the exploitation of children. Its wrong when the Catholic Church hierarchy looks the other way, when Penn State averts its eyes, and also when we as a society do the same thing."}

{"text": "The dean of the law school of the University of California, Berkeley, sexually harassed his executive assistant over a period of several months, and then was allowed to stay on the job out of concern for his career after an internal investigation found her sexual harassment complaints to be justified, according to a lawsuit announced Wednesday.The assistant, Tyann Sorrell, 41, said in papers filed Tuesday in Alameda County Superior Court, that the dean, Sujit Choudhry, hugged and kissed her almost daily, while she was at her desk and sometimes in public from September 2014 until March 2015.If you think of maybe the last person on earth who would do this, you would think it would be the dean of one of the most prestigious law schools in the country, John D. Winer, her lawyer, said Wednesday.In a statement, Mr. Choudhry said that he disagreed with the allegations and would defend against them. But on Thursday, the law school announced that he had resigned as dean.We are under no illusion that a resignation could or even should bring this matter and broader, related issues to a close, the school said in a statement attributed to the chancellor, Nicholas Dirks, and the executive vice chancellor and provost, Claude Steele.They said Mr. Choudhry would remain on the law school faculty at present under the rules of the university tenure system.The chancellor and provost said in the statement they believed that criticism of the university for not removing Mr. Choudhry from his position earlier was legitimate. The administration remained sharply focused on maintaining a safe environment for students, faculty and staff, they said.In recent years, many universities, including Berkeley, have adopted strict policies about sexual misconduct and taken steps to train everyone from staff to students in how to prevent it.After her initial complaints to superiors were unheeded, Ms. Sorrell sent an email to a human resources director, who reported her complaints to the universitys central Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination, the court papers say. In July 2015, an internal university investigation found that Mr. Choudhry had violated the universitys sexual harassment policy, according to court papers.The dean was given a 10-percent, one-year reduction in salary, ordered to write a letter of apology to Ms. Sorrell and required to take sexual harassment training  which he had skipped until then  and have his workplace behavior monitored, according to the court papers.The court papers say that when Ms. Sorrell questioned why university officials had not taken stronger action against Mr. Choudhry, Mr. Steele told her that he had decided against termination because it would ruin the deans career, that is, destroy his future chances for higher appointment.After the lawsuit was announced, Berkeley initially released a statement from Mr. Steele, the provost, saying that Mr. Choudhry would take an indefinite leave of absence, stepping down to his faculty position and salary.Mr. Steele confirmed that an internal investigation had found that Mr. Choudhrys behavior violated policy, and that he demonstrated a failure to understand the power dynamic and the effect of his actions on the plaintiff personally and in her employment.Mr. Steele said he believed at the time of the investigation that his punishment of Mr. Choudhry was appropriate. But, he added, I intend to listen carefully to what members of our campus community and others have to suggest when it comes to how we prevent and respond to incidents like these.Mr. Steele said he had granted Ms. Sorrell a fully paid leave, which she is still on, and promised to help her find another job on campus. Her lawyer said she had applied for several such jobs and had not been hired.Mr. Winer said Wednesday that in light of Berkeleys avowed commitment to preventing sexual harassment, he found it strange that Mr. Choudhry had not been fired. A zero-tolerance policy means youre fired, Mr. Winer said.The court papers said Ms. Sorrell had learned the dean had also harassed other women employees at the university. She began suffering from insomnia, her hair fell out and she dreaded going to work, but she did not have the courage at first to confront the dean because she had been a victim of previous domestic abuse, the lawsuit said. She is suing for unspecified monetary damages."}

Thousands more from around the world tuned in to livestreams and watched as the distant daytime skies darkened.Those who viewed the event from places like Indonesia or Micronesia saw the moon completely engulf the sun  a moment known as totality  and caught a rare glimpse of the stars roaring corona. They also saw what looked like a diamond ring when light from the sun flickered from behind the moon in the seconds before and after totality.When the moons shadow swept across the Pacific Ocean, it also created partial eclipses visible from India, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Myanmar and other South and Southeast Asian countries. Here are some images from the spectacle:Some 36,000 feet in the air, people aboard Alaska Airlines Flight 870 captured this image of the total solar eclipse while flying to Hawaii from Alaska."}
{"text": "The more hours you work, the greater your risk for heart disease.Several observational studies have found an association of long work hours with an increased risk for cardiovascular illness. Now a new retrospective analysis has found there is a dose-response relationship: more hours, more risk.Researchers began following 1,926 men and women in 1986, tracking their health and work history through 2011. Over the course of the study, in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, 822 were given diagnoses of cardiovascular disease.After adjusting for age, sex, income and other factors, they found that for each additional hour of work per week over 10 years, there was a 1 percent increase in the risk for heart disease.Compared with working 45 hours a week, working 55 hours increased the risk by 16 percent, 60 hours by 35 percent, 65 hours by 52 percent, and 70 hours by 74 percent. Working 75 hours or more doubled the risk for a cardiovascular problem  angina, coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke or heart attack.Still, the lead author, Sadie H. Conway, an assistant professor at the University of Texas School of Public Health, does not recommend that anyone alter work hours based on her study.I would never tell a person dont work long hours because of this risk, but its something that shouldnt be ignored from a public health standpoint."}
{"text": "(This article has been updated.)We spring forward, and then fall back.But why?The reason the United States and many other countries, mostly in the West, shift to daylight saving time is contentious and confusing, and some of the more popular explanations are not grounded in reality. (It isnt for farmers, as you may have learned in school.)In 2017, the ritual will take place on Sunday, when Americans will push their clocks forward an hour. The general concept is to move an hour of sunlight from the early morning, when many would sleep through it, to the evening, when you could most likely do more with the light.For most people, an extra hour of daylight in the evening after work or after school is much more usable than the hour of daylight in the morning, said David Prerau, the author of Seize the Daylight.But since the idea was put in place, it has faced detractors and debate. Several states, including California and Rhode Island, are considering abolishing the practice. As with many other congressional acts, its worth considering who the beneficiaries are.Extra daylight means extra time to spend money.And if youre in the United States, youre probably going to get in your car to go spend that money.Americans really do leave their homes when there is more sunlight at the end of the day, said Michael Downing, a lecturer at Tufts University and the author of Spring Forward: The Annual Madness of Daylight Saving Time.We go to the parks, and we go to the mall, but we dont walk there, he said. Daylight saving increases gasoline consumption.No one is more aware of that than gas stations, which is why the Association for Convenience and Fuel Retailing, a lobbying group for convenience stores, has pushed to start daylight saving time earlier in the year. In 2010, Jeff Miller, the groups chairman at the time, said the industry had added an estimated $1 billion in annual sales since the organization lobbied to add a month to daylight saving in 1986.Thats tens of billions of dollars in sales since then, he said in a news release.Those in the leisure industry have also benefited, Mr. Downing said. For example, he said, the Chamber of Commerce has lobbied on behalf of retailers that sell gardening, home repair or sports equipment. Lobbyists from the golf industry estimated in 1986 that an extra month of daylight saving would be worth $200 million to $400 million.Before lights were installed in professional stadiums, Major League Baseball had to end some games in ties because of darkness, and fans often felt robbed by such dissatisfying endings. In the two seasons after daylight saving began, the number of ties decreased to five from 22.It might be surprising to find farmers in this category considering the common belief that they are the reason for daylight saving time.I dont know how that ever became a myth, but it is the exact opposite, Mr. Prerau said. He said daylight saving time actually disrupts farmers schedules.Initially, farmers were the strongest lobby against the change. But since then, opposition has fragmented into much smaller interest groups, Mr. Downing said, including religious groups that schedule prayers around sunrise. Parents have also complained about having their children walk to school in the dark.Some have argued it leads to an increase in traffic accidents. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York warned drivers to be vigilant, calling the morning commute that will now be darker a serious danger.And some anti-federalists are opposed to what they consider unnecessary government intervention. (Arizona and Hawaii are the only two states that have held out.)The idea was originally rooted in saving candle wax, not electricity.Historians have traced the notion back to Benjamin Franklin, who realized he was sleeping through some daylight hours while visiting Paris in the 18th century. He suggested French officials shoot cannons at sunrise to jolt people out of bed, optimizing the amount of hours they spent awake when its light out. That way, they could cut down on using candles to light their homes while awake, Mr. Prerau said.But the first idea to move the clock hands came from William Willett, who unsuccessfully proposed it to the British Parliament in 1908. Germany, however, seeking cost savings during World War I, heard the idea and enacted it in 1915. Three weeks later, the British followed, and other world powers were close behind, including the United States in 1918.Reducing energy consumption is still often cited as a chief driver of daylight saving time, but experts cant agree on whether that is actually a result. There have been many conflicting studies.A Department of Energy report from 2008 found that the extended daylight saving time put in place in 2005 saved about 0.5 percent in total electricity use per day.But Matthew Kotchen, a Yale economist, found a 1 percent increase in electricity use after Indiana introduced daylight saving statewide in 2006, estimating a cost of $9 million per year for consumers.The consequence for Indiana has been higher electricity bills and more pollution from power plants, Mr. Kotchen wrote in Room for Debate.Mr. Downing said the idea was originally based on having an eight-hour economy, but electricity demand is no longer based on sunrises and sunsets  not when theres air conditioning.It has long been a cynical substitute for real energy policy, he said. Its the ideal energy policy because it has no apparent direct cost to consumers, and it asks no one to consume less."}
{"text": "In the 1920s, the American heiress Peggy Guggenheim plunged into the bohemian swirl of Paris, where she stayed on and off for two decades, acquiring artist lovers and their paintings with equal gusto. And this week she returned  at least in spirit.The colorful eccentric is the inspiration behind a new collection of jewelry presented by the Los Angeles designer Sonia Boyajian. Over the last two weeks in Paris, she displayed her kinetic-looking earrings and sculptural necklaces like tiny works of art on the walls of a rented rooftop apartment in the Marais, and styled herself like Guggenheim, complete with signature batwing specs, for an accompanying look book.A lot of artists made Peggys jewelry, says Boyajian, who became interested in Guggenheim after reading her autobiography, Confessions of an Art Addict, originally published in 1960, and seeing the 2015 documentary, Peggy Guggenheim: Art Addict by Lisa Immordino Vreeland, which follows the collector from New York to Paris to Venice, where her palazzo is now a museum. If you look at pictures of her bedroom in Venice, all the jewelry and earrings are hanging like artwork. I found that to be so inspiring, not treating it like a commodity.After returning from Europe to New York, Guggenheim opened the Art of This Century gallery on West 57th Street to house her growing collection. At the opening party on Oct. 20, 1942, she wore one earring made for her by artist Yves Tanguy and one by Alexander Calder, to symbolize her impartiality between the surrealist and abstract art movements, according to Guggenheims autobiography. It was a beautiful way to express what was happening, and it got me thinking that this could be a collection, Boyajian says.Each piece in Boyajians Jewels of This Century collection is an interpretation of a piece worn by and created for Guggenheim, including disc earrings reminiscent of the pair painted by Tanguy, spinning wire shoulder dusters in the style of Calder and a necklace with a pendant the shape of Guggenheims famous glasses, which were originally created by the artist Edward Melcarth.Boyajian launched her namesake line of artful jewelry in 2003, and in 2014, she opened an atelier/boutique in Hollywood. Its a whimsical fantasy land of jewelry spilling out of drawers, hanging from chandeliers and coming together on her work table, where she makes everything herself by hand, setting semiprecious stones, mismatched beads and bird- and fish-shaped pendants using twisted wire. When women come to my studio, its about dressing up, says Boyajian, explaining why she decided to pose as Peggy in her look book. I wanted people to see that Im playing with my jewelry and they should, too."}
{"text": "When police officers came upon the body of Neda Mae Carter in a park in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, 25 years ago, her face and neck were battered, her arms splayed and her legs straight, in the pose of a crucifixion.A man named Andre Hatchett would be convicted of second-degree murder, based on the testimony of a man who claimed to have witnessed the killing.On Thursday afternoon, prosecutors in State Supreme Court admitted what Mr. Hatchett had maintained since his arrest: that he had not killed Ms. Carter.Mr. Hatchett was failed by almost every institution he came into contact with during the course of his prosecution, Mark Hale, who leads the Brooklyn district attorneys Conviction Review Unit, told a courtroom crammed with Mr. Hatchetts friends and relatives.A wide smile spread across Mr. Hatchetts face and the audience burst into applause as a judge vacated the conviction and dismissed the indictment, carrying out the joint request from prosecutors and Mr. Hatchetts legal team, which includes lawyers from the Innocence Project.Ive been to hell and back, but it feels good to be free, Mr. Hatchett said, his arms draped over his sisters as they walked through Downtown Brooklyn.Mr. Hatchett is the 19th person exonerated in Brooklyn since the district attorney, Ken Thompson, took office in 2014 and bolstered efforts to review questionable convictions. Mr. Hatchetts case had taken place during the tenure of Mr. Thompsons predecessor, Charles J. Hynes, who had created a review unit but was faulted for not acting promptly in resolving questionable cases and for standing by prosecutors accused of misconduct.Before his arrest, Mr. Hatchett was a new father and an ice delivery man living in an apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant with his mother. Now 49, Mr. Hatchett has spent nearly 25 years behind bars. While in prison, he lost both his parents, as well as a son.Seema Saifee, a staff attorney at the Innocence Project, said a confluence of forces had doomed Mr. Hatchett.This case involved a perfect storm of error  bad defense counsel, an unreliable witness, critical evidence that was never disclosed to the defense, Ms. Saifee said.When the killing occurred, on Feb. 18, 1991, Mr. Hatchett was 24 and hobbling on crutches after being hit with bullets in the throat and leg as a bystander in a shooting the previous year. He had an I.Q. of 63, with the reading and writing ability of a first grader, according to lawyers from the Innocence Project.Mr. Hatchett and Ms. Carter had seen each other earlier on the evening of the murder, in a rooming house where his aunt lived alongside Ms. Carter and her mother. Mr. Hatchett gave Ms. Carter money to buy crack, his lawyers said in an interview. She left around 9:30 p.m. and never returned.Though he cooperated with the police and provided an alibi, Mr. Hatchett was arrested and convicted almost entirely on the testimony of a career criminal named Gerard Williams, who said that he had seen, from 30 to 40 feet away, Mr. Hatchett striking a body on the ground in the park that night.Mr. Williams offered the account after he was arrested in connection with a burglary a little over a week after the killing, and after having initially identified someone else as the killer  information the prosecutors never gave the defense, as was required.The defense itself was so incompetent that a judge declared Mr. Hatchetts first trial a mistrial. But even at the second trial, Mr. Hatchetts lawyer failed to present evidence of his intellectual disability or of the fact that his injuries would almost certainly have prevented him from striking Ms. Carter with the force Mr. Williams had described or lugging her body across the park while leaning on crutches.Its frightening how easy it is to convict an innocent person in this country, Ms. Saifee said. And its overwhelmingly difficult to release an innocent person.Barry C. Scheck, a founder of the Innocence Project, praised Mr. Thompsons office for working tirelessly with Mr. Hatchetts team, which also included a lawyer from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, on their efforts. Without this collaboration, Mr. Hatchett would likely still be in jail, Mr. Scheck said.Lawyers from the Innocence Project said that cases similar to that of Mr. Hatchett could be avoided with the right legal safeguards in place, though many proposed changes have languished in Albany for years.The New York Legislature is considering legislation combating the roles that eyewitness misidentification and false confessions play in wrongful convictions. A 2016 proposal by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would mandate, among other regulations, that the police record interrogations of suspects in most violent-crime cases.I just know Im not the only one, Mr. Hatchett said. Theres still a lot of innocent people in jail.Still, the moment demanded celebration. As Mr. Hatchett walked with his family to a Dallas BBQ restaurant for a steak dinner, he began planning a move with his sister Christal Hatchett-Simmons to a house in Pennsylvania.I can already see it, he said. My future."}
{"text": "During presidential election years, Americans of varying political persuasions often contemplate moving to Canada. Google queries for Canada spike. Conversations between friends turn to preferred Canadian destinations.This year, Canada is playing along. A website for Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia, called Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins, popped up in recent weeks and has attracted significant attention. The site even has information on immigration and housing.Now, an advertising agency, Critical Mass, part of the advertising giant Omnicom, is looking to capitalize on the quadrennial interest. On Monday, the agency, which was founded in 1996 in Calgary, put up the website movetocanadaeh.com.On the surface, the website seems like a joke. Make Canada Even Greater, the introductory text reads, in a nod to a certain politicians campaign slogan. Symbols of Canada are everywhere  a moose, maple syrup, the Canadian flag, a hockey player in a jersey with a maple leaf. Theres even a section on what to expect from your new home (Canada is big, High poutine diets).Its where the zeitgeist is going, said Dianne Wilkins, the chief executive of Critical Mass. Were in a unique place to comment on and participate in this public half-comedy, half-serious discussion thats going on out there.But beneath the goofy website is a more serious goal: talent acquisition. Critical Mass, now a global digital agency whose clients include Nissan and Citi, is looking to hire roughly 30 people to work in its Calgary and Toronto offices.The campaign, while timely, also speaks to an underlying fear in the ad industry that talent may be slipping away. For many years, creative types who also wanted a job that paid the bills  and made their parents proud  went to advertising agencies. But competition for creative talent is much fiercer today, and agencies are seeing people go instead to companies like Facebook and Google.Critical Mass says the website is already proving successful. Traffic from the site has increased page views on its Toronto careers site by 2,310 percent and on its Calgary careers site by 244 percent, it says. Traffic to the agencys website has increased 50 percent.The website may be slightly silly, but it could also offend particularly patriotic Americans. It is also trying to capitalize on a cultural moment, which means it could feel stale once the moment passes. And because the campaign is geared more toward the advertising industry than the general public, it might not garner widespread attention.Ms. Wilkins said an employee on the agencys marketing team in Chicago had the initial idea last week after seeing a BuzzFeed post about moving to Canada after the election. By Monday, the site was live, a stunningly fast turnaround for an industry that seems at times as if it wants to debate and tweak everything ad infinitum.How did Critical Mass get the site up and running so quickly? Were our own client, Ms. Wilkins said, which helps."}
{"text": "While most of us are focused on presidential politics  with good reason, to be sure  much of the work of government, for good and for ill, is done at the state and local level. In most cases, these days, that means Republican politicians are calling the shots; but there are some big states where Democrats still hold sway, and its really important for progressive values that these Democrats set a positive example about what good government can do.Which brings me to Governor Cuomos sudden proposal, seemingly out the blue, to cut half a billion dollars in state funding for CUNY and shift the burden to the city.Full disclosure: I am now a CUNY employee. But thats not the reason I think this would be a terrible idea. The point is, instead, that CUNY as an institution is doing such obvious good, especially in an era of growing inequality and hardening class lines, that its hard to understand why anyone who isnt the hardest of hard-line conservatives would want to undermine it.CUNY has long been a powerful engine of social mobility; my father, the son of penniless immigrants, went to Brooklyn College, which gave him opportunities he could never have found otherwise. And its still playing that role. If you look at the student body today, you see a portrait of the American dream in action: hundreds of thousands of students, roughly 40 percent of whom are their familys first generation in college, come from households with income less than $20,000, or both, all getting an affordable education that leaves them far less burdened by debt than all too many of their contemporaries.We need more of this kind of thing  much more  not savage budget cuts that are driven by no fiscal imperative I can see.Dont do this, Mr. Governor."}
{"text": "Senate Democrats are eager for President Obama to announce his choice for the Supreme Court and to put a human face on their battle with Senate Republicans over filling the vacancy. And Mr. Obama said on Thursday that he thought it was important for me to nominate a Supreme Court nominee quickly because I think its important for the Supreme Court to have its full complement of judges.But just what the timing will be remains unclear. Mr. Obama, in a joint news conference with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, said he did not feel the need to take shortcuts in terms of the selection and vetting process.Still, many on Capitol Hill expect the announcement to come before the Senate breaks next week for two weeks into early April, allowing Democrats to press a new front in the nomination fight just as Senate Republicans return home to face questions about it. And they anticipate that Mr. Obama would make a decision before he leaves on what will be a high-profile trip to Cuba on March 21.But White House officials have made it clear that they are taking the search for and selection of a fitting nominee very seriously, despite Senate Republicans pledge to not engage in a confirmation process at all. They say the president will not be rushed into what he considers one of the most important decisions in the role.Mr. Obama did offer some detail on Thursday on the qualities he would seek in a nominee.Obviously, its somebody who I want to make sure follows the Constitution; cares about things like stare decisis and precedent; understands the necessary humility of a judge at any level in looking at statute, looking at what the elected branches are doing; is not viewing themselves as making law or, in some ways, standing above elected representatives, he said. Notably, he added that he wanted to be sure the nominee recognizes the critical role that that branch plays in protecting minorities to ensuring that the political system doesnt skew in ways that systematically leave people out."}
{"text": "PALM BEACH, Fla.  I think there are two Donald Trumps, said the first version of Donald J. Trump, addressing reporters at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, his club where he was endorsed by his former Republican presidential rival Ben Carson on Friday.Then, moments later, the second version emerged, to offer an opposing theory: I dont think there are two Donald Trumps, said this Mr. Trump. I think theres one Donald Trump.Ah, to be Donald Trump, either version.Mr. Trump was responding to questions about his public and private persona, first raised by Mr. Carson, who said, There are two different Donald Trumps.Theres the one you see on the stage, and theres the one whos very cerebral, sits there and considers things very carefully, Mr. Carson said. You can have a very good conversation with him. And thats the Donald Trump that youre going to start seeing more and more of right now.Asked about the discrepancy between his showman-like public self and more private self, Mr. Trump first said he agreed with Mr. Carsons assessment. His public version, he said, seems to have worked over my lifetime. But, he added: Im a big thinker. And I have my ideas and theyre strong, and typically they worked out.But later, prompted by reporters, he returned to the question, first saying he doesnt like to overanalyze myself, before offering a bit of introspection. I will tell you that I try and be who I am, I want to be honest, certain questions are asked of me and I give a straight answer as opposed to a politically correct answer, he said. I know the politically correct business better than anybody.Seeming to realize the political peril of saying he would give different answers in private that he does in public, he added that he always answers questions honestly, before finally concluding:  I dont think there are two Donald Trumps. I think theres one Donald Trump.But, he added: You have somebody else that sits and reads and thinks, and Im a thinker and I have been a thinker, and perhaps people dont think of me that way, because you dont see me in that forum. But I am a thinker. I thought it was very nice what Ben said, because it is another side of me. Im a very deep thinker. I know whats happening."}

{"text": "The next president will have to set the direction of the fight against terrorism, define Americas role in the Syrian war, which has created a refugee crisis that is destabilizing Europe, and address the tensions between China and its neighbors that could turn into military conflict.Yet few of the presidential candidates have offered much sense of how they would actually take on these critical problems, and none, other than Hillary Clinton, inspires any confidence in this arena. The truth is, foreign policy will very likely dominate the next administration, as it has dominated much of the Obama presidency.Mrs. Clinton, a former secretary of state, is the most experienced in foreign affairs among the candidates and is strongly supported by much of the Democratic Partys centrist foreign policy establishment. She is likely to continue on President Obamas path, though there is a concern that she might be too willing to intervene militarily.Senator Bernie Sanders, Mrs. Clintons Democratic rival, has repeatedly invoked the disastrous Iraq war, which he voted against, to deflect from the scant attention he has paid to foreign policy more broadly. While Mr. Sanders says the Islamic State, or ISIS, must be stopped, he has admitted he has no real solution to the threat. He talks vaguely of America having a support role in Syria while Saudi Arabia and Iran take the lead in sending ground troops against ISIS.As secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton wanted to do more to help the rebels fighting President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; she also supported the American intervention in Libya. She is calling now for a no-fly zone in Syria to protect civilians, which some Republicans have also advocated. Mr. Obama, like the Pentagon, has resisted that idea, which risks drawing America deeper into the Syrian conflict.On the Republican side, the candidates have placed more emphasis on increasing military spending, which often leads to a reliance on military solutions over diplomacy. Donald Trump, who revels in his ignorance of world affairs, often switches positions and has yet to put together a team of foreign policy advisers.Senator Marco Rubio may be the most hawkish contender. He is the only one still defending the Iraq war and praising President George W. Bush who kept us safe. Gov. John Kasich wants to arm the Ukrainian forces and believes it is time we punched the Russians in the nose.When it comes to the Islamic State, most of the Republicans favor more bombing. Senator Ted Cruz has thundered about carpet-bombing the extremists, which would indiscriminately kill civilians. Mr. Trump has proposed sending American troops back into Iraq to take over the oil facilities. He is apparently unaware that ISIS pumps most of its oil in Syria and that any such oil grab would stoke anti-American sentiment. Mr. Trump endorses waterboarding and other forms of torture. He seems to not understand that such practices are war crimes, banned by American and international law, erode the countrys credibility and provoke more radicalism.On Syria, Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders have said it would be unwise for the United States to topple Mr. Assad, pointing out that the region would be more stable if Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya and Iraqs Saddam Hussein had stayed in place. Yet, to solve the North Korean nuclear threat, Mr. Trump says China should make North Koreas leader disappear, and Mr. Kasich argues for regime change, both risky options.All the Republican candidates have rejected the agreement that has constrained Irans nuclear program, yet none has offered a credible alternative. Mrs. Clinton, who helped begin negotiations with Iran, and Mr. Sanders both support the deal. Mrs. Clinton is taking a much harder line in demanding that it be strictly enforced and that sanctions be tightened because of Irans ballistic missile tests.The next president will have to manage an unstable world where challenges are becoming more complex, from the aggressive policies of China and Russia, to the India-Pakistan nuclear arms race and Americas role in Asia. Voters know more about Mrs. Clintons views than those of the other candidates. They deserve a fuller discussion on these issues from all of them."}
{"text": "When he was in the middle of his Syrian peace deal negotiations, Secretary of State John Kerry would go to President Obama with a request: Could the U.S. quietly send a few cruise missiles to hit Assad regime targets, just to send a message and maybe move the Syrian president toward a deal.Kerrys looking like a chump with the Russians, because he has no leverage, a senior administration official told Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic.Obama continually said no, and eventually grew impatient. Goldberg asked Kerry if he thought he has more of a bias toward action than Obama. I do probably, Kerry responded. Id say that I think weve had a very symbiotic, synergistic, whatever you call it, relationship which works very effectively. Because Ill come in with a bias toward Lets try to do this, lets try to do that, lets get this done.The new Goldberg essay is a profound and comprehensive look at President Obamas foreign policy thinking, and especially his steadfast desire to reduce American involvement in the Middle East.But its also fascinating to read in the midst of a presidential campaign. It shows how insanely far removed campaign bloviation is from the reality of actually governing. It also reveals that the performance of presidents, especially on foreign policy, is shaped by how leaders attach to problems. Some leaders are like dogs: They want to bound right in and make things happen. Some are more like cats: They want to detach and maybe look for a pressure point here or there.If we want to understand the dog or catlike qualities in candidates, we should be asking them a different set of questions:How much do you think a president can change the flow of world events?President Obama, for example, has a limited or, if you want to put it that way, realistic view of the extent of American influence. He subscribes to a series of propositions that frequently push him toward nonintervention: The world is a tough, complicated, messy, mean place and full of hardship and tragedy, he told Goldberg. You cant fix everything. Sometimes you can only shine a spotlight.Furthermore, Obama argues, because of our history, American military efforts are looked at with suspicion. Allies are unreliable. Ukraine is always going to be in Russias sphere of influence, so its efforts there will always trump ours. The Middle East is a morass and no longer that important to U.S. interests.Even the Iran nuclear deal is seen as a limited endeavor  not to reshape the Middle East but simply to make a dangerous country less dangerous.Do you think out loud in tandem with a community, or do you process internally?Throughout the Goldberg article, Obama is seen thinking deeply and subtly, but apart from the group around him. In catlike fashion, he is a man who knows his own mind and trusts his own judgment. His decision not to bomb Syria after it crossed the chemical weapons red line was made almost entirely alone. His senior advisers were shocked when he announced it. The secretaries of state and defense were not in the room.More generally, Obama expresses disdain with the foreign policy community. He is critical of most of his fellow world leaders  impatient with most European ones, fed up with most Middle Eastern ones.When seeking a description of a situation, does your mind leap for the clarifying single truth or do you step back to see the complex web of factors?Ronald Reagan typified the single clarifying truth habit of mind, both when he was describing an enemy (Evil Empire) and when he was calling for change (tear down this wall). In his interviews with Goldberg, Obama leans to the other side of the spectrum. He is continually stepping back, starting with analyses of human nature, how people behave when social order breaks down, the roots and nature of tribalism.Do you see international affairs as a passionate struggle or a conversation and negotiation?Obama shows a continual distrust of passion. He doesnt see much value in macho bluffing or chest-thumping, or in lofty Churchillian rhetoric, or in bombings done in the name of credibility. He may be critical, but he is not a hater. He doesnt even let anger interfere with his appraisal of Vladimir Putin, praising him for being courteous and businesslike. Because fear distorts judgment, he seeks to place the threat of terrorism in its proper perspective: More Americans die from falling in bathtubs.Personally, I dont think there is one correct answer to whether we want a dog or a cat as leader. Depends on the situation; there are successful examples of both types. But Im struck by how catlike Obama is. And its striking how many Americans have responded by going for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, who are bad versions of the bounding in/we-can-change-everything doggy type."}
{"text": "When the businessman Charles Finch threw his first BAFTA party at Lolas in Greater London in 1999, people showed up, he recalls, because nobody really had anywhere else to go. But in the years since, his annual dinner  now held at Annabels on the eve of the BAFTAs, with a crew of regulars that includes Cate Blanchett, Harvey Weinstein and Mick Jagger  has come to be regarded as one of the most intimate, cozy and fun parties of the year.Finch says the feel of his party was inspired by Swifty Lazars Oscars bash at Spago in Los Angeles  which Finch himself never attended but used to watch enviously from his tiny Hollywood apartment during his years as a struggling screenwriter. Now, hes collected 16 years worth of photographs and memories from his own party into a new book, The Night Before BAFTA, out from Assouline this month. We had all the photographs from the parties on the walls of our office, which was starting to look like a 1960s Italian restaurant, Finch jokes. I would just stare at them and think, We have to do something with these pictures. With an introduction by John Malkovich, the book is packed full of photographs and reflections from everyone from Naomi Watts and Cate Blanchett to Bob Geldof and Christian Louboutin.T asked the legendary host to share tips for hosting a party that people actually look forward to attending  as well as some insights into what makes British parties more fun than their American counterparts.British parties are very democratic. People are expected to sit down and enjoy dinner. I think that makes them feel at home. Its not like in New York, where you expect people to come for 20 minutes and then leave. Often at New York dinners, people will say, Im having the first course and then Im leaving, and its over by 9:30. At my party, we dont sit down until 9:30.Hollywood is such an industry town, so the parties tend to be industry-led. Few of them are personal. I think thats a big difference with my parties: I want it to be more of a party, and not an event. Im not a corporate person. Im not interested in any sort of pecking order. The purpose of my party is to hug the people that I like, or just shake the hands of people I really admire, and have some nice red wine and some food. I dont want it to be panicky. I want it to be very relaxed.Its important for the host to be polite enough to say hello to guests. Surprisingly enough, not many people do that. But its a big thing, symbolically, to be at the front door shaking peoples hands, saying, Im so happy youre here. Armani always used to do that at his parties. If there are people I dont know, I always introduce myself. I try to look into their eyes and ask them about their life. For the most part, I try to invite people that I already know. Ive always been pretty tough on people saying, I want to bring my brother and my sister and my uncle. I want to make sure the feeling of the room is really cozy.The seating plan is bloody difficult. Usually, I have to be rugby tackled into making it, because I spend days avoiding it, hiding out and pretending its going to do itself. I think its quite a good idea to seat people with people they actually like, even if they see each other all the time. I think people like going to a party and sitting with people they already know and love. It gives them a sense of security. If youre going out on a Saturday night, its nice to know all your friends will be there, instead of going and sitting with people youre never going to see again, or, at the end of a busy week, sitting with people and having to explain who you are. I want you to go and sit around the table and have your friends there, but also someone who you deeply admire, or someone whos fascinating. I like to have a painter next to an actor next to a politician  which I think is very different from what happens in Hollywood, where at the industry parties, everyone is in the same business. At my parties, theres a very interesting mix of people.Before people sit down, its important to make the effort to introduce them correctly. You have to make sure the people who are going to sit together all know something about each other, because then theyre going to talk.I think you can get away with 14 people at a table. Anything bigger than that is hard to manage. Round tables are obviously better than long ones. Annabels is a tricky club because there are some tables for four  which is quite a complicated thing, because who are you going to seat at a table for four at a dinner party for 200 people?I try not to have people waiting too long for the food. We always have lamb and dauphinoise potatoes and a lobster salad to start. Occasionally a different chef will try something new and Ill say Absolutely not, because I believe that reputation is repetition. My ex-wife, Sydney, has a very defined and limited culinary palate. Her favorite dish is spaghetti Bolognese, so its a tradition to make sure she always has it.I always have white lilies at the party, because I love the smell. Theres also always a Mariachi band, in honor of my dear friend Jimmy Goldsmith, who used to host me for Christmas in Mexico. I love the music. It makes me so happy.The atmosphere feels different every year. Little things can throw the room, like if somebodys flight didnt come, or three extra people showed up, or Tom Cruise decided to show up at the last minute. It depends on the crowd. Parties are very fragile things."}
{"text": "Shari Redstone pulls her iPhone out of her purse to show off just one picture of her grandchildren. She laughs then apologizes when she sees that the back of the phone is covered with heart-shaped stickers  the result of a craft session with the two youngsters.Petite, with coifed blond hair, sharp blue eyes and a cautious smile, Ms. Redstone is the picture of a doting grandmother. Beneath that cheery exterior, though, is a tenacious woman at the center of a battle over her familys fortune as well as the fate of two of the worlds largest media companies, Viacom and CBS.My life is really good, Ms. Redstone, 61, said during a rare interview recently. It is a dream life, she said, except for the part that is not a dream life.Ms. Redstone is the intensely private daughter of Sumner M. Redstone, the pugnacious mogul who ruthlessly assembled a $40 billion entertainment empire, including Viacoms MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon cable networks, the Paramount film and television studios and the CBS broadcast network.A Massachusetts native who speaks in a pronounced Boston accent, Ms. Redstone shies from public attention with the same alacrity that her father attracted it. Her father and mother divorced after 52 years of marriage. He then remarried and dated women decades younger. He was sued by Ms. Redstones uncle, brother and cousin. He has feuded publicly with his children and cycled through a series of chief executives at his companies. He famously declared that he would never die.Now, Mr. Redstone is 92, in poor health and confined to his $20 million Beverly Hills mansion. After he dies, or is deemed incompetent, Ms. Redstone is expected to face off against Viacoms current leadership, including some of her fathers closest confidants, to determine what becomes of his media empire  and by extension her childrens inheritance and familys legacy.The relationship between father and daughter is complicated. She was the one he phoned after surviving a hotel fire when he was 55. He persuaded her to join the family business and once told a reporter that life wasnt complete until people had met Shari.Over the years, however, he has denigrated her in conversations with other executives and chastised her for meddling in his business. He publicly criticized her attempts to position herself to eventually succeed him as chairman of Viacom and CBS. Their feuding often made headlines, such as the time he wrote a letter to Forbes saying his children had done little or nothing to help build the family empire. Sometimes father and daughter communicated exclusively through fax or lawyers, if at all.Today shes not in his will. The bulk of the estate goes to charity.Ms. Redstone says that she has patched up her very public disagreements with her father. Lately, she has been a frequent presence in his home.That portrayal of their relationship is being challenged now in a salacious lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles by a former companion and romantic partner of Mr. Redstone. The suit says that he is not mentally competent and that Ms. Redstone manipulated him to take control of his life, his companies and his money.The rosy picture painted by Shari of her supposed reconciliation with her father is a smoke screen, Manuela Herzer, the former companion, said in a recent declaration to the court. Her sudden conversion to the loving, omnipresent daughter coincides with this epic battle for control of his empire.Ms. Redstone declined to discuss the suit or her fathers health. Her spokeswoman called the claims in the suit unfounded, as have lawyers for Mr. Redstone, who declined to comment beyond their court filings.But even the judge presiding over the case has questioned whether the relationship between the father and daughter is as patched up as claimed, citing that Mr. Redstone put Viacom executives ahead of his own daughter to make decisions about his health in case he is incapacitated.That legal brawl, scheduled to go to trial in May, is just one part of a broader struggle for money and power across Mr. Redstones empire. The battleground is a uniquely convoluted corporate structure.Mr. Redstone controls Viacom and CBS through National Amusements, a private theater chain started by his father, which holds about 80 percent of the voting stock in the two companies. After Mr. Redstone dies, his stake in National Amusements will go to a trust created to benefit his five grandchildren.The trust wields great power. It could, for instance, endorse the current leadership, install a new board and executive team or even sell the companies. Ms. Redstone is one of the seven voting members of that trust.She declined to discuss board activity, and her exact plans are not clear, beyond that she does not personally want to lead either of the two companies. Also not clear is how many members of the trust will side with Ms. Redstone. Several people close to her, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the deliberations are private, say she has the support of at least two.While Ms. Redstone has supported the executive ranks at CBS, which has delivered fairly strong results, she has opposed the leadership at Viacom, which has struggled as younger viewers abandon traditional television and flock to the web. Last month, she voted against elevating Viacoms chief executive, Philippe P. Dauman, to the chairmans position when her father vacated it. Earlier, she declined the position for herself.Ms. Redstone is known to say that she has 80 percent of her fathers brains, 90 percent of his passion and 100 percent of his obsessive nature. That is likely to be a forceful combination as she prepares for what is certain to be an epic saga.Ms. Redstone was born in 1954, the same year her father left his lucrative job at a Washington law firm to return home to the Boston area and join his fathers movie-theater chain, eventually called National Amusements. He traded his annual pay of about $100,000, or about $880,000 today, for an initial salary of about $5,000, or about $44,000 today.Back then, Mr. Redstone was a local entrepreneur, intent on expanding his chain of drive-in theaters and trading up to indoor theaters. All that changed in 1987 when Mr. Redstone wrested control of Viacom in a hostile takeover, claiming his position as a global media titan.By then, though, Ms. Redstone was already in her 30s. My father was always my father  I never really saw him in any other role, Ms. Redstone said in the interview.She described her childhood as a typical suburban upbringing. The family lived in a modest house in Newton, Mass., just outside Boston. She recalled how, back in the movie-theater days, he would bring home books and Tootsie Rolls from his business trips.There was a glamorous side. In college at Tufts University, Ms. Redstone and a friend wanted to spend a summer in California, so her father set her up with a job at Paramount, where she worked on TV shows like Love, American Style and Mannix and made her share of coffee runs.Still, she said, she never saw herself working in show business. My father was a very strong, powerful presence in the industry, and I think it was really important for me to establish myself in a world that had nothing to do with him, she explained. Her preference, she said, was a career in social service.One friend, James Packer, the Australian billionaire and son of the media mogul Kerry Packer, who died in 2005, said in an interview that he understood the pressures. Were the children of fathers with big shadows, he said. We are all so lucky to have those fathers. Life is complex.Ms. Redstone went to law school and worked as a criminal defense lawyer at a small Boston firm. She married in 1980, started a family and, when her children were older, decided to pursue a degree in social work after volunteering at a trauma center for abused children.Thats when her father brought her into the family business. He was spending more time in New York with Viacom and wanted more family oversight over National Amusements in Boston. He persuaded Ms. Redstone to run it.My grandfather started this business, she said. It was our family legacy.Ms. Redstone, who was going through a divorce at the time, agreed to work at National Amusements two days a week for a year. Six months later she was working full time.At National Amusements, Ms. Redstone focused on two areas where she thought she could carve out her own reputation: expanding internationally into Russia and South America, and upgrading the moviegoing experience beyond popcorn tubs and sticky theater floors.In some theaters she began adding reserved premium seating, full dining menus and cocktails she helped design, such as the Smores Martini, a mix of vodka, toasted-marshmallow syrup, cream and a marshmallow garnish. She is particularly proud that Tom Brady, the quarterback for the New England Patriots, and his wife, Gisele Bndchen, have told her that they go to the chains Showcase SuperLux theater in Chestnut Hill, Mass., for date night.I dont like to follow in the footsteps, Ms. Redstone said. I like to learn from the footsteps that came before me, forge a new path.National Amusements is a private company, so it is difficult to gauge its business performance over the years. Jawad Hussain, an analyst for Standard & Poors, called the companys management and governance weak because National Amusements core theater business is operating below average compared to peers on measures such as cash flow generated per theater.As time went on, the harmony between father and daughter got out of sync. There was a series of public squabbles after Mr. Redstone brought her in as vice chairwoman of Viacom in 2005. (The first time he asked, she said no.) She pushed for more authority and stronger corporate governance measures, such as tying compensation to performance. At least once, he threatened to oust her.She was the only member of the National Amusements board to oppose investing several hundred million dollars in Midway Games, the video game company that eventually filed for bankruptcy. And in 2008 she helped National Amusements refinance debt payments that ultimately forced the sale of Viacom and CBS shares, which he had opposed.Over the years, some Viacom executives described Ms. Redstone as meddlesome and impatient in a quest for power, questioning her business acumen. Mel Karmazin, a former chief executive of Viacom, decided that neither Ms. Redstone nor her brother, Brent, who both were on the board at the time, should attend budget meetings.Some media executives have questioned whether the reaction to Ms. Redstone was, in part, because she was a woman in a male-dominated business. Others characterized her as earnest, eager, smart and cognizant of the digital changes transforming the business.After helping National Amusements negotiate its debts, Ms. Redstone decided it was time to set off on her own path. Today, she remains its president, yet her new focus is the venture capital firm Advancit Capital, which she started in 2011 with her son-in-law, Jason Ostheimer. The firm, which invests in media and technology start-ups, has had some high-profile sales, including a $500 million sale of Maker Studios, which creates online video programming, to the Walt Disney Company.Advancit recently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise an additional $40 million for investments. I am seeing the world as it is going to be, Ms. Redstone said of Advancits ambitions. I am exposed to the future, not just of media, but of the world.Ms. Redstone also spoke in April at the White House on behalf of a group promoting legal help for people with low incomes, a reflection, she says, of her early career dreams.Over the years, Ms. Redstone has struggled to balance her desire to make her own mark on the Redstone legacy yet live a quiet life and shield herself, her children and her grandchildren from the spotlight.She loves to cook, has held season tickets to the Patriots since 1986 and asks for recommendations for new TV shows to binge-watch. Two favorites are Jane the Virgin and The Bletchley Circle. She is known to walk the hallways of hotels for exercise and at night listens to podcasts or short stories by Dostoyevsky because she doesnt sleep well.It is really hard when your life is scrutinized by people who dont know you and who dont really know what the situation is, Ms. Redstone said. So I avoid the good and the bad and just try to live in a world where I can insulate myself from whatever is out there.Recently, Ms. Redstone and her family took a vacation to celebrate her mothers 91st birthday. After a dinner one evening in a room overlooking the ocean, Ms. Redstone received a note from the staff telling her that they appeared to be the perfect happy family.Oh, God, she later recalled, with a laugh. You guys dont know the half of it."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON  President Obama on Thursday said the United States and Canada were more closely aligned than ever, using a meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to announce joint efforts to curb emissions of planet-warming gases and to promote his personal rapport with the leader of a pivotal neighbor.Mr. Obama played the older, more experienced host to Mr. Trudeaus fresh-faced newcomer during the visit, the first official one by a Canadian leader in 19 years, as the two announced that they were teaming up to reduce the release of methane, a chemical contained in natural gas.He campaigned on a message of hope and of change; his positive and optimistic vision is inspiring young people, Mr. Obama said at a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, drawing unmistakable parallels between Mr. Trudeaus rise to power and his own. On the world stage, his country is leading on climate change and cares deeply about development, so from my perspective, whats not to like?Mr. Obama, 54, welcomed Mr. Trudeau, 44, with a formal arrival ceremony on the South Lawn featuring a 19-gun salute, color guards and military bands. Mr. Trudeau was greeted by cheering onlookers waving miniature American and Canadian flags, reflecting the same brand of rock-star adulation that characterized many of Mr. Obamas 2008 campaign appearances.The official visit unfolded against the backdrop of an increasingly intense campaign to succeed Mr. Obama. Mr. Trudeau, who has joked about welcoming Americans to his country if they are afraid of a Donald J. Trump presidency, diplomatically declined to criticize the Republican presidential front-runner during the news conference.I have tremendous confidence in the American people and look forward to working with whomever they choose to send to this White House later this year, Mr. Trudeau said, answering a question about the stakes for his country and its relationship with the United States should Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, win the White House.A somewhat amused Mr. Obama rejected the idea that his own tenure had helped to fuel Mr. Trumps rise, arguing that the Republican political elites and news media were responsible for setting a divisive tone and elevating an us-versus-them mentality  including questions about the presidents birthplace  that created an atmosphere in which Mr. Trump thrived.I have been blamed by Republicans for a lot of things, but being blamed for their primaries and who theyre selecting for their party is, Mr. Obama said with a long pause and a grin, novel.What Im not going to do is to validate some notion that the Republican crackup thats been taking place is a consequence of actions that Ive taken, he added.On policy, Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau promised that their two countries would play a leadership role internationally in the low-carbon global economy over the coming decades. As part of the announcement, United States officials said they would immediately begin a new push to regulate methane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities, though finishing that process before the end of Mr. Obamas tenure is unlikely.The Obama administration wants to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The Interior Department has proposed a number of regulations on methane leaks, but it has yet to write a regulation governing such leaks from current oil and gas drilling on public land.Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau also pledged to cooperate in preserving the Arctic, and to move more quickly to carry out agreements made in climate talks in Paris last year.The president and I agree on many things, including, of paramount importance, the direction we want to take our countries in to ensure a clean and prosperous future, Mr. Trudeau said, thanking the president, whom he addressed as Barack, for his leadership on climate change. Canada and the U.S. will stand side by side to confront the pressing needs that face not only our two countries, but the entire planet.The official visit was to conclude with a state dinner in the East Room of the White House.The arrival of Mr. Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Grgoire Trudeau  accompanied by their three young children  has prompted comparisons to a similar visit in 1977 by Pierre Trudeau, then the prime minister and the current leaders father. That visit made headlines when Margaret Trudeau, his wife, wore a short dress that fell just below the knee to the White House state dinner.While Canada and the United States have long been close allies, Mr. Obamas efforts to confront global warming was a major point of contention with Mr. Trudeaus predecessor, Stephen Harper, who sought to aggressively expand Canadas oil industry.As Mr. Obama became more determined to leave behind a lasting environmental legacy, he delayed and eventually rejected construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would have transported nearly a million barrels a day of heavily polluting petroleum from the Alberta oil sands to refineries on the Gulf Coast.Mr. Obamas rejection of the pipeline severely strained relations with Mr. Harper, but Mr. Trudeaus election last year signaled a shift in policy that was welcomed by the White House. Mr. Trudeau did not criticize Mr. Obamas stance on the pipeline, and he has pledged to pursue an ambitious environmental agenda dovetailing with Mr. Obamas policies.In December, Canadian officials helped to push through a historic global climate agreement in Paris.In their Oval Office meeting on Thursday, the leaders also discussed military cooperation, efforts to combat terrorism, improvements in trade and environmental concerns.They agreed to push forward on an agreement allowing travelers from each country to be pre-cleared through immigration and customs, aiding tourism and commerce. The two leaders also struck a deal to share more information  including on no-fly lists and border crossings  in an effort to prevent foreign fighters from traveling freely between Canada and the United States.They parted with some issues unresolved, most prominently a decades-old dispute over softwood lumber. American officials say lumber from Canada is unfairly subsidized by the government there, an assertion that Canadian officials reject. Both leaders said they were optimistic about resolving their differences on the matter in the coming months.Its been a longstanding bilateral irritant, but it hardly defines the nature of the U.S.-Canadian relationship, Mr. Obama said, adding that while each side would likely be dissatisfied with the outcome, officials would ultimately find a middle ground on the issue. People will complain and grumble, Mr. Obama said. But it will be fine."}
{"text": "Lawyers for dozens of former Credit Suisse brokers have appealed to the brokerage industrys main regulator to step into a fight over millions of dollars of accumulated bonus payments the brokers say the bank owes them.The lawyers have an issue with where their arguments will be heard.Credit Suisse shut its private bank division last year, striking an agreement for its nearly 270 advisers to move their business to Wells Fargo. But many of those advisers, who had been with Credit Suisse and predecessor companies for decades, jumped to UBS, Morgan Stanley or other big banks instead. More than 90 went to UBS.Because they did not go to Wells Fargo, Credit Suisse says, they voluntarily resigned, forfeiting their right to collect any accumulated deferred compensation  which for some brokers added up to millions of dollars.Ordinarily, brokers could take their claims to arbitration through the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, which regulates the brokerage industry. But Credit Suisse requires claims to go through either the American Arbitration Association, or JAMS, once known as the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service, instead of Finra.Lawyers for the brokers say that is a violation of Finras policies, and they are trying to get the regulator to weigh in on the issue.Finra not only can but should resolve intra-industry disputes, the lawyers argue in a letter this week to the Finra chairman, Richard G. Ketchum, and others at the agency. They called the dispute resolution policy at Credit Suisse a blatant and egregious violation of Finra rules, which require arbitration at Finra if a dispute is between brokerage firms or firms and brokers.Finra must act on its own behalf to continue functioning as a credible regulator, according to the letter, which was signed by nine lawyers who represent the former Credit Suisse brokers, several of whom are in the middle of the arbitration process over their departures from the bank last fall.A Finra spokeswoman said, While I cannot comment on the specifics, I can say that we are reviewing the issues raised.It is the latest twist in the battle over the deferred compensation that began in October, when Credit Suisse announced the plans to move the business to Wells Fargo, setting off a mad scramble for the exits.The lawyers for the former Credit Suisse brokers say Finra arbitrations are more advantageous because more information is known about the arbitrators, many of whom are retired industry professionals, and monetary awards are publicly available.Already Credit Suisse has moved to block two Finra arbitration claims filed by former brokers in Miami, both of whom left in December to join UBS. The two are former relationship managers in Credit Suisses private bank.However, Credit Suisse can point to a recent victory in court, in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said companies could waive Finra arbitration in favor of other arbitration venues.Credit Suisse itself filed a Finra arbitration claim against UBS in December, accusing its Swiss rival of raiding staff. That dispute has not been settled.A Credit Suisse spokeswoman declined to comment. UBS said in a statement that it believes the claims are without merit given Credit Suisses decision to exit its U.S. private banking business. We intend to aggressively defend against them in the arbitration.Deferred compensation for brokers is the industry standard, intended to act as a set of golden handcuffs to keep top producing employees from jumping to rivals, said Danny Sarch, an executive recruiter who helped move some of the Credit Suisse brokers to other companies.Leaving a company would put that pay in jeopardy, but I dont know of a circumstance where the firm abandons the business and doesnt pay, he said. Theres nothing voluntary about these plans."}

Ms. Ruhl has twice been a Pulitzer finalist, for The Clean House and In the Next Room (or the Vibrator Play) and is a recipient of a MacArthur Foundation fellowship.The new play by Ms. Herzog, Mary Jane, is about a woman caring for her ailing son, and will be staged from April 28 to May 20, 2017. Ms. Herzog was a Pulitzer finalist for 4000 Miles.The Yale Rep season will also include the world premiere of Imogen Says Nothing, by Aditi Brennan Kapil, as well as productions of Seven Guitars, by Mr. Wilson, and Assassins, with music and lyrics by Mr. Sondheim and a book by John Weidman."}
{"text": "It isnt just that Rembrandts Judas Returning the Thirty Pieces of Silver is recognized as the artists first masterpiece. Or that it hasnt been seen in the United States before. What makes the Morgan Library & Museums coming exhibition noteworthy is that it will include three preparatory drawings of the painting, making it one of Rembrandts only works for which such sketches survive.Because theyre so much less finished than the painting, you have the sense of the artist at work, thinking out loud onto the page with lots of corrections and changes, said John Marciari, head of the Morgans drawings and prints department. You begin to understand part of the creative process in drawings that were never meant to be exhibited.The painting, which will go on view June 3, was completed when Rembrandt was just 23 and forecast many of the characteristics that would make him famous  chiaroscuro, harmonic composition, drama.Its a rarely seen work that shows Judas on the floor in absolute torment having returned the 30 pieces of silver to the priests in remorse for having betrayed Christ, said the Morgans director, Colin B. Bailey. They are looking disdainfully at him  imperious, unmoved.The show will also include self-portraits of a young Rembrandt, along with etchings and drawings of scenes from the life of Jesus that illustrate the development of Rembrandts style, and those of his friend and colleague Jan Lievens.They want to be painters of history, Mr. Bailey said. Theyre taking subjects from mythology, Greek and Roman history and the Bible and rendering them in powerful ways.In perhaps the surest sign that Silicon Valley has officially joined the art world, Gagosian is opening a gallery in San Francisco on May 18.It was a business decision, said Larry Gagosian, who now owns 16 galleries. I wouldnt have done it if it werent for the emerging collector base.The gallery is not alone in identifying a happening moment in the area. Pace is opening a gallery next month in Palo Alto, Calif. The John Berggruen Gallery is moving to the corner of Howard and Hawthorne Streets in San Francisco from Grant Avenue. FOG Design & Art in January completed its third fair. And the renovated San Francisco Museum of Modern Art is reopening in May.The whole area is being redeveloped, said Anna Gavazzi, director of the new San Francisco gallery. Definitely something is happening there.The 4,500-square-foot space on Howard Street, designed by wHY Architecture, is across the street from the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. To give our artists the kind of visibility and overlap with that committed an audience made it a much easier decision, said Sam Orlofsky, a director in Gagosians New York gallery. As I started mentioning it to some of the artists, their eyes lit up like they did before we opened in Rome or Paris.San Francisco captures a lot of peoples imagination as the kind of place theyd like to work, he continued. Everyone has a version of San Francisco in their minds eye.Louise Fishman didnt want to have to die to earn a retrospective.So in 2012, Ms. Fishman, the Abstract Expressionist painter, teamed with the curator Simon Watson to present a historical show at the Jack Tilton gallery, while Cheim & Read mounted a contemporaneous exhibition of her new paintings.Those shows helped inspire the Neuberger Museum of Art to give Ms. Fishman her first major museum survey, opening on April 3. The Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia is mounting a companion exhibition, focusing on her miniature paintings, handmade accordion-style books and other constructions.Im 77, and Im at the height of my powers, Ms. Fishman said. How did this happen? As my grandmother would say, Who knew?The Neuberger show spans Ms. Fishmans career, from 1968 to the present, including examples from her 1973 Angry Women series and her Remembrance & Renewal paintings related to the Holocaust, which used actual ashes she retrieved from Auschwitz in the 80s.The work is not one thing, said Helaine Posner, the Neubergers senior curator of contemporary art. Theres been a real development over time.Despite this evolution, the curators say, the themes that have long informed Ms. Fishmans work  namely feminism, Judaism and queerness  continue to endure. The politics might not be on the canvas but theyre behind the painting, said Ingrid Schaffner, a curator who is organizing the Institute of Contemporary Art show. Her politics  her activism as a feminist, as a lesbian  are major forces driving the work.The artist duo Elmgreen & Dragset have installed a Prada store on a stretch of highway in Marfa, Tex.; the figure of an art collector face down in a swimming pool at the Venice Biennale; and a rocking horse in Trafalgar Square in London.Now the Berlin-based team  Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset  is bringing a full-size pool to Rockefeller Center.The sculpture, Van Goghs Ear  an empty pool to be positioned upright overlooking Fifth Avenue at the entrance to the Channel Gardens  will be on view from April 13 through June 3, courtesy of the Public Art Fund and Tishman Speyer, the real estate company.It is a swimming pool, but it becomes a kind of surrealist object in the shadow of this extraordinary iconic building that represents so much of U.S. industry and architecture, said Nicholas Baume, the art funds director and chief curator. A wonderfully dissonant image."}
{"text": "During World War II, the Nazis imprisoned African-American athletes and jazz musicians and European Jews with passports from the United States and Latin America at Tittmoning Castle in Bavaria. The black detainees had been working overseas, partly to escape racism at home, and some had European wives and children who were also taken to interment centers.The little-known wartime deprivations of foreign nationals imprisoned by the Nazis come to life in a collection of caricatures that were drawn at Tittmoning and are on view through March 31 at the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York.Max Brandel, a Jewish artist from Poland, made the sketches in 1943 for a fellow inmate, Jerome Mahrer, a Manhattan-born Jewish schoolboy. Mr. Mahrer, now a retired guidance counselor living in Manhattan, described life at Tittmoning as mildly civilized.He and his wife, Carolyn, donated the album to the museum in 1999, and information is still being gleaned about its contents. Its cover was made from a Red Cross box, stamped package for prisoner of war, by another inmate, Peter Rosenbaum, a German Jewish teenager whose family had acquired Salvadoran passports. (Mr. Mahrers son-in-law, Gregory Hiestand, is writing a book about the familys wartime experiences.)Mr. Brandel had wangled a Costa Rican passport. He shared a dank room on the medieval castles top floor with about 20 other Jews, including Jerome Mahrer and Jeromes older brother, Peter Mahrer. The prisoner-of-war camp received occasional packages from American charities containing canned meat, art supplies and a few musical instruments.After the war, Mr. Brandel moved to New York with his wife, Lottie, who had been interned in France, and became a contributor to Mad magazine. Their daughter, Eve Brandel, a retired librarian, discovered the existence of the Tittmoning sketches in 2014 when she saw them on the museums website.Her father, who died in 1975 at 64, never talked about the past  zero, Ms. Brandel said. Maybe, she said, the sketching helped him cope. Some of the works show African-Americans playing piano or guitar, and guards baring their teeth.Sitters for some of the images inscribed the pages. The wrestler Kemal Abdul Rahman Berry, whose professional name was Reginald Siki, wrote, Lets keep going! The pianist Freddy Johnson noted the title of a song, September in the Rain, that the young Jerome was trying to master on the accordion. Squeeze Box Man was the guitarist and banjoist John Mitchells nickname for the boy.Keep still, Jerrys there! Mr. Rosenbaum wrote on his portrait. He was referring to older inmates shushing one another when they did not want the boy to overhear something.They protected Jerry from bad news, Ms. Mahrer said, adding that Peter Mahrer also protected him from sexual predators. The brothers received a few letters from their mother, Betty, who was interned near the Swiss border. Polish internees arrived at Tittmoning with warnings of atrocities committed not far from the castle walls. We kind of didnt believe them, Jerome Mahrer said.Jerome Mahrer was born in New York in 1929; his father, Paul, a soccer star on Czechoslovakias Olympic team, had been playing for American leagues. The family later returned to Prague. When businesses stopped serving Jews, Jerome, as an American citizen, was still allowed to go to stores and to the movies. (He has kept some brittle reddish ticket stubs from Prague, including one from a theater named Olympic.) When the family was deported, his father was sent to Theresienstadt, where the Nazis made propaganda films of him playing soccer.The Mahrer brothers are helping Eve Brandel in her research on the fates of the Tittmoning prisoners. After the war, the wrestler Mr. Berry returned to the ring; he died in 1948, at 49. There seems to be little information about what happened to Mr. Mitchell, the performer William Walker, the boxer Jack Taylor or a Georgia native named Oscar Lee Mathis.Ms. Brandel has also studied paintings and sketches by Josef Nassy, a black artist of Jewish descent who was imprisoned at Tittmoning. He was a Suriname native who had a United States passport and a Belgian wife. Many of his portraits of inmates, including those of the African-Americans and the Mahrer brothers, belong to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.Mosaic slabs will be on the move this spring, and a few sections that were dispersed decades ago will be reunited.In an exhibition opening on March 24, Gods and Mortals at Olympus: Ancient Dion, City of Zeus, the Onassis Cultural Center in New York will display mosaic depictions of Dionysuss life that were installed about 1,800 years ago at the base of Mount Olympus. Dimitrios Pandermalis, president of the Acropolis Museum and director of excavations at Dion, Greece, said that when the panels are returned to Dion, a new museum there will allow visitors to watch conservators at work.At the Getty Villa in Malibu, Calif., Roman Mosaics Across the Empire, opening on March 30, will survey ancient flooring from Turkey, Syria, Italy and France as well as Tunisia, where the Getty Conservation Institute is helping to protect mosaic pavements amid Roman ruins. The Gettys mosaic of a boxing match will hang alongside a tableau of mythological hunters borrowed from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Both came from Villelaure, a hamlet in southern France, and were sold separately in the 1920s. A study center is being built in Villelaure, where more mosaic flooring has been excavated.The Penn Museum in Philadelphia is showing checkerboard pebble mosaics found near Ankara, Turkey, in The Golden Age of King Midas, and mosaics of intertwined sea creatures are on view in Pompeii, at the Montreal Museum of Fine Art. A Roman mosaic floor with wildlife motifs from Lod, Israel, is at the Frost Art Museum at Florida International University in Miami (with an exhibition catalog from Scala Arts). Last year more mosaic flooring was discovered at Lod.This month crews are maneuvering a 170-square-foot mosaic slab with geometric patterns, made in Antioch 1,600 years ago, into galleries that open in September in the Davis Museum at Wellesley College. Recent books in the field have delved into Byzantine church mosaics in Greece and Turkey and Islamic mosaic floors at Hishams Palace in Jericho in the West Bank. And on April 12, Christies in New York will offer a Roman mosaic panel measuring four feet by five feet (estimated at $200,000 to $300,000) that portrays deities frolicking under grapevines."}

{"text": "WASHINGTON   In his much-discussed interview with The Atlantic magazine, President Obama unloaded on a number of American allies: Britain, France, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and other Persian Gulf countries. On Friday, a White House official walked back Mr. Obamas comments about the closest of the allies, Britain, and its prime minister, David Cameron.President Obama values deeply the special relationship between the United States and our allies in the U.K., the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, told reporters on Air Force One after he was asked about the comments, which provoked a storm of angry headlines and commentary in the British news media.The president, Mr. Earnest insisted, had not directly criticized Mr. Cameron in interviews with The Atlantics national correspondent, Jeffrey Goldberg. Mr. Obama, he said, viewed the prime minister as a particularly effective interlocutor and a partner and ally when it comes to confronting core national security priorities for both our countries.In the article, Mr. Goldberg wrote that Mr. Obama was disappointed that Britain and France, after having led the charge for a NATO military intervention in Libya, did not follow up in working to stabilize the country. Mr. Cameron stopped paying attention to Libya because he was distracted by a range of other things, the president said.That did not go down well in Britain. Obama savages Cameron on Libya, said a headline in The Independent. Obama lays the blame for Libya mess on Cameron, said The Times, which described his comments as an extraordinary attack on a sitting British leader.Its a bit rich of President Obama to single out Britain and France, and not include the United States, Malcolm Rifkind, a former British foreign secretary, said to the BBC. If theres criticism, looking at your own action is sometimes appropriate.Mr. Obama and Mr. Cameron had cultivated a chummy relationship. They played table tennis at a school in London in May 2011, two months after the United States and Britain launched airstrikes against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya. In March 2012, Mr. Obama took Mr. Cameron to a college basketball game in Dayton, Ohio, where they ate hot dogs while the president explained the game to his British guest.Mr. Obama was even more critical of the former president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defense and essentially set up the entire infrastructure. The White House did not address those comments on Friday.Mr. Obama saved some of his strongest words for Saudi Arabia, which he said needed to learn how to share the Middle East with its archenemy, Iran. Free riders aggravate me, the president said. On Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry met with King Salman and other senior Saudi officials, but said only, We have to talk about Syria.Mr. Earnest refused to back down from Mr. Obamas characterization of Turkeys president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as a failure and an authoritarian. Mr. Goldberg did not quote the president on Mr. Erdogan, but wrote that he was immensely frustrated by him, in part because he had refused to deploy Turkish troops to stabilize Syria.We did spend some period of time urging the Turks to engage more effectively with our counter-ISIL coalition, Mr. Earnest said, using the administrations acronym for the Islamic State. Even though we have been able to effectively cooperate with the Turks on Syria in a whole host of areas, we have also expressed our concern with some aspects of the political climate inside of Turkey."}
{"text": "PARIS  Like the wars themselves, the looting of antiquities in Syria and other conflict zones in the Middle East is proving virtually impossible to stop, despite the best efforts of a host of international agencies, cultural organizations and dogged independent researchers.As the pillaging continues in a region rich in layers of ancient civilizations, the international community is focusing on the marketplace, doing what it can to scare off demand in hopes that supply will shrink. There wouldnt be any looting if there wasnt money to be made, said Kathryn Walker Tubb, a lecturer at the Institute of Archaeology at University College London.In the past few years, the effort to intercept the illicit trade has intensified.In February last year, the United Nations Security Council passed a resolution banning trade in artifacts illegally removed from Syria since 2011 and from Iraq since 1990. The International Council of Museums has issued red lists for objects at risk in Iraq, Syria and now Libya. Last August, the State Department in Washington announced a $5 million reward for information that could disrupt the ransacking and looting of cultural sites by the Islamic State, or ISIS.Last month, Unesco followed up its Emergency Safeguarding of the Syrian Heritage Project, introduced in 2014 with the European Union, with a special task force that would deploy experts from Italys carabinieri force, with its long experience in tracking down looted art, to help hunt down stolen items.The Asia Society and the Antiquities Coalition recently concluded an international conference on cultural racketeering with calls for special training for customs agents and support for local governments in conflict zones to catalogue and safeguard their treasures.We believe it is imperative to do what we can, said Christine Anagnos, the executive director of the Association of Art Museum Directors, which last October issued a set of safe haven protocols that offer protection for cultural property put at risk by wars and other disasters, with the guarantee that it will be returned to home countries once its safety can be assured. As of February, however, no offers have been made to deposit endangered objects for safekeeping in foreign museums, Ms. Anagnos said.There have been scattered successes in recuperating smuggled antiquities from war zones. In March 2015, a police raid in Bulgaria uncovered a cache of statues and other objects thought to be from the ancient Sumerian city of Lagash, in southern Iraq. Also that month, the United States returned to the Iraqi government 65 stolen artifacts that had come from a Dubai-based dealer who had tried to sell them, with faked paperwork, to American museums and galleries.But investigations rarely produce arrests because of the difficulty in proving the provenance of antiquities, often produced by civilizations that stretched across the ancient world.Traffickers are also  masters at coming up with fake documents that purport to show that the disputed object had been long held by mysterious collectors, now conveniently deceased. Such lack of evidence often means that the authorities often choose to avoid pursuing criminal charges in return for reclaiming the objects, which results in shady dealers getting off the hook, experts say.But the publicity surrounding the effort to stem the flow of smuggled artifacts from Syria, Iraq and other war zones in the Middle East has had a dampening effect, said Christopher Marinello, the founder and director of the Art Recovery Group, an organization in London that has developed a database to recover lost and stolen artworks around the world.The media coverage has done such an incredible job that any reputable dealer will have taken a huge step backwards, Mr. Marinello said. We see dealers and auction houses coming in with questions about specific objects. We have seen catalogues for antiquities shrink. Small items periodically appear on e-commerce sites: Two coins from Apamea, a looted archaeological site in Syria, recently showed up on eBay, priced at $84 and $133.But most people agree that the market for larger, more valuable pieces has shrunk under international pressure. This concerns Ms. Tubb who fears that precious artifacts are being stashed in warehouses  in the Middle East but also in Europe  where they will remain hidden until the pressure eases.Who knows where these things are housed, she said. There are all sorts of different routes.Col. Ludovic Ehrhart, an investigator for Frances cultural theft police unit, told Le Monde that those trading in blood antiquities can afford to bide their time. These long-standing networks wait three, five, even 10 years before they sell them on the official market,  he said.The role played by terrorist groups such as Islamic State in the looting of antiquities from the Middle East has helped put a chill on the market, Mr. Marinello said. It didnt hurt that the F.B.I. has said you could be arrested for aiding international terrorism, he said. That is quite an incentive to not buy something. Although Islamic States vicious attacks and subsequent pillaging of Syrian sites like Palmyra have attracted attention, there are other culprits.It is not just the Islamic State that is destroying or looting, said Sam Hardy, a research associate at University College Londons Institute of Archaeology, although they have certainly upped the attention.The looting at Apamea, one of the largest and best preserved Roman and Byzantine sites in the world, took place on an industrial scale, as seen on satellite images that show the area pockmarked by a grid of more than 5,000 looting pits, at a time when the area was under the control of the Syrian government.That may not indicate looting that was directed by the regime, said Mr. Hardy,  but it does suggest looting that benefited the regime.According to a 2015 report by the American Schools of Oriental Researchs Cultural Heritage Initiative, based on satellite images of 1,200 archaeological sites in Syria, more than 25 percent have been looted since the civil war began. Most of the pillaging happened in areas with weak governance, including places occupied by Kurdish and opposition forces, the report says.Hard proof of the Islamic States involvement in antiquities trafficking came in May, when a United States-led raid on a compound in eastern Syria used by Abu Sayyaf, a commander identified as the director of the terrorist groups oil smuggling and its trade in antique objects.Abu Sayyaf, who was killed in the operation, was in possession of an odd assortment of artifacts  including an ivory plaque traced to the museum in Mosul, Iraq  Islamic State territory  as well as a collection of coins, bracelets and other easy-to-transport objects and a few obvious fakes.The cache also revealed receipts for the 20 percent tax on precious materials  antiquities, but also minerals  collected from civilians by Islamic State. The total sum shown from these tax receipts reportedly amounted to $265,000, suggesting that the antiquities trade is just a small part of the groups financing streams. But it shows the lengths to which the local population is willing to go to survive.War is always the worst time for cultural heritage, particularly in a part of the world that was a cradle of civilization, Mr. Marinello said."}
{"text": "LONDON  After seven years in the West End here, War Horse is onto its final furlong. Just after 10 p.m. on Saturday, its equine star, Joey  that magnificent puppet  will gallop offstage at the New London Theater for the last time. Some 2.7 million people will have cheered him on there, but War Horse has been a global success, seen by nearly seven million worldwide. It has changed the National Theater, which opened it in 2007  and arguably British theater as a whole  dramatically.The concept still sounds unlikely: a World War I play starring a life-size puppet horse. But War Horse worked. Nick Staffords adaptation of Michael Morpurgos novel, about a Devonshire farm boy and his prize horse, separated by events in Europe, captures the horrors of modern, mechanical warfare. The staging, by contrast, directed by Marianne Elliott and Tom Morris, is humble and human, with folk songs by John Tams and the exquisite, handcrafted puppets created by the South African theater company Handspring. Their designer, Adrian Kohler, was the son of a South African boatbuilder. It shows.No one expected a hit  it started with actors running around a National rehearsal room in 2005 with cardboard horse heads and newspaper tails  but a hit it became. A huge one, which included a two-year Broadway run that won five Tony awards, including best play, in 2011. Joey, Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times, is the kind of matinee idol New York hasnt seen in ages.In Britain, War Horse has been a cultural phenomenon. When the Queen celebrated her Diamond Jubilee with a pageant down the River Thames, Joey reared up on the roof of the National Theater in salute. And subsequent international tours and franchised productions on four continents have made the National a global brand. Last September, a new Mandarin translation opened in China, where it tours until May.Joey has worked and worked and worked, said Rufus Norris, the Nationals artistic director, who took over from Nicholas Hytner in 2014. As an ambassador for the National and what this theater can do, weve never had one like that puppet.Britains subsidized theaters used to hand their hits over to commercial producers for a meager royalty fee. In 2006, the National broke the mold by single-handedly transferring The History Boys to the West End for four months. War Horse would be its first runaway smash.To oversee it, the National established a commercial arm, NT Productions. As well as keeping artistic quality control on the work ourselves, it meant we could look after the returns for it, Mr. Norris explained.The show has taken in 140 million pounds ($200 million) at the British box office  300 million ($430 million) worldwide  and left the National equipped to move subsequent successes like One Man, Two Guvnors and The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time into the West End and beyond. (Other troupes have followed suit: the Royal Shakespeare Company with Matilda the Musical, for instance.)All of this has meant a period of extraordinary growth: Since 2007, the Nationals annual revenue has increased to 117 million ($166 million), from 48 million ($68 million). Profits from commercial transfers contributed around 7.5 million ($10.7 million) to the Nationals recent 80 million ($115 million) refurbishment  a project never even envisaged before War Horse  to transform the foyers and amenities of Denys Lasduns brutalist South Bank building.Thats a fantastic asset for the next 50 years, Mr. Norris said. What it meant is that we did, as an organization, become slightly commercially dependent.Since 2010, the National has faced cuts to its government subsidy, which its commercial transfers have helped to offset.So why close the show now? Lisa Burger, the Nationals executive director, said it had a bumpy summer.Though it never tipped into the red, Ms. Burger said it came close. (Unlike on Broadway, London theaters dont release sales figures.) The National decided not to undertake the costly process of recasting it once more. There was every prospect that if we did so, we would lose money next financial year, Ms. Burger explained.But even if it had proved profitable for another year, shuttering the show sends a particular message  that the new artistic team is standing on its own feet. Mr. Norris said the organization had become leaner and no longer needed to rely on commercial transfers  now or in the future. Were halfway down the line of weaning ourselves off that, he predicted. The books will balance this year.The shows artistic influence, however, is likely to remain. Historically, British theater has centered on the playwright, but for the most successful show of the last decade to be a devised project is a great provocation, Mr. Norris said. Others have followed: London Road and Curious Incident were both developed similarly.One of Mr. Norriss first moves as artistic director has been to merge the literary department and the National Theater Studio  its research and development space  into a single entity, now known as the New Work Department. The aim is to embrace a range of theater artists and practices.During its remodeling, the National built a temporary theater, the Shed, funded entirely by Broadway profits from War Horse and made for small-scale experimental shows. Though intended as a one-year fix, it will house its final production in April, three years after opening, and its success has influenced the programming across the theaters three other spaces.Behind the scenes, the National isnt seeking out the next War Horse, nor does it need to, but Mr. Norris insists it is poised to exploit whatever comes along.The hits, he added, are never the ones you think they are."}
{"text": "CONSUMERS who have a flexible health care spending account at work need to double-check their employers rules to see if they have an important deadline coming up.At many employers, March 15 is the end of a flexible spending account grace period, by which employees must spend money set aside last year. Any balances left over after the deadline are forfeited (unless the employer allows rollovers).Flexible spending accounts allow employees to save money by setting aside a portion of their paycheck before deductions for taxes to help pay for things their insurance doesnt cover, like deductibles, co-payments and medical supplies.Rules for the accounts  known officially as flexible health spending arrangements  have evolved, and have led to some confusion in recent years because they may differ from one employer to another.Previously, the accounts were governed by the use it or lose it rule: If funds in an account werent depleted by the end of the year, the employee forfeited any remaining balance. Fear over losing the money they set aside, however, generally led workers to be conservative in their contributions, and some avoided the accounts altogether.To help address that problem, many employers adopted a two-and-a-half-month grace period. Since many plans run on a calendar year ending Dec. 31, that gives employees until March 15 to spend the funds set aside the previous year.Then, in late 2013, the federal government changed the rules again, giving employers the option of allowing workers to carry over as much as $500 in a flexible spending account into a new benefit year. Employers must choose between the carry-over option and a grace period; they cannot offer both.The Society for Human Resource Management says about 69 percent of employers offer the accounts and about a third of them offer the carry-over option. It makes the accounts a little bit easier to live with, said Bruce Elliott, manager of compensation and benefits for the society. You dont have to rush to the store to spend it.But about another third of employers still offer the accounts with a grace period.According to the FSAstore.com, an online store that specializes in selling F.S.A.-eligible items, more than a third of visitors to the site say they dont know which option their employer offers (employers dont have to offer either one). So a call to your benefits office is a good idea, said Jeremy Miller, the stores founder and president.If you do have a balance to spend, a range of items qualify for purchase. In addition to staples like contact lenses and solution, breast pumps and knee braces, high-tech items are popular purchases, Mr. Miller said. These include smartphone-enabled blood pressure monitors, as well as electrotherapy devices, which are used to ease pain through electrical impulses.More traditional items include sunscreen, first aid kits, thermometers and shoe insoles for arch support.Here are some questions and answers about flexible health spending accounts: How much money can I set aside in my F.S.A.?For 2016, the maximum that can be set aside is $2,550, the same amount as last year. Can I pay for over-the-counter medicines with F.S.A. funds?Flexible spending account money generally cannot be used to pay for over-the-counter drugs like allergy medication and pain relievers  unless you obtain a prescription for them from your doctor. Is a flexible spending account the same as a health savings account?Health savings accounts are also aimed at helping people manage health costs with pretax money, but they function a bit differently. F.S.A.s. are available only through employers, while H.S.A.s are available to self-employed people as well. Also, theres never a spending deadline with an H.S.A.; all the money you contribute rolls over each year if you dont spend it and remains yours, even if you get a new job."}

Though the board will initially expand to 13 with the new members, it will shrink to 11 after the companys annual meeting, when two current directors will stand down.Shares of Autodesk closed up 1.2 percent on Friday, at $56.61.Fridays announcement is the latest instance of a company choosing to settle with activist investors looking to shake up its plans rather than wage potentially long and costly battles.Only two weeks ago, Autodesk appeared ready to fight Sachem Head and Eminence. During the companys earnings call on Feb. 25, the software makers chief executive, Carl Bass, compared the two hedge funds to callers on sports-radio talk shows.From a transcript of the call provided by Standard & Poors Capital IQ:On Friday, however, Crawford W. Beveridge, non-executive chairman of the board, struck a more conciliatory tone toward his new fellow directors.We welcome Scott, Rick and Jeff to the board, who bring considerable expertise in technology, finance and governance for the benefit of the company and its shareholders, Mr. Beveridge said.When Sachem Head first emerged as an investor in Autodesk last November, the hedge fund disclosed wanting to discuss financial matters like costs. Now Mr. Ferguson, a protg of veteran activist William A. Ackman, will have some say as a member of the boards compensation and human resources committee.Mr. Hill will serve on the corporate governance and nominating committee, while Mr. Clarke will join the audit committee.The actions taken by the company are evidence that there is a strong alignment between the current board and shareholders on a path forward that will drive long-term shareholder value, Mr. Ferguson said in a statement.Ricky Sandler, Eminences chief executive, added: We are pleased to have reached a constructive agreement with the board and are confident that the addition of these directors will help create significant value for all shareholders. As committed long-term investors, we strongly support Autodesks business model transition and move to the cloud."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES   There was singing inside the Cleveland Cavaliers locker room late Thursday night.As the players were shedding their uniforms and dipping their feet into buckets of ice, Kyrie Irving, James Jones and Jordan McRae trilled a dawdling rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner, uncoiling the lines with waggish emotion as their teammates looked on and laughed.The Cavaliers have been craving this sort of harmony. They defeated the Los Angeles Lakers at Staples Center on Thursday to improve their record to 46-18 and keep a foothold atop the Eastern Conference. Yet they remain one of the more unfulfilled, angst-ridden first-place teams in recent memory.The standards they have set for themselves this season have been demandingly high  lofty enough to match their league-high payroll. For the season to be deemed a success, it very likely must end with a championship trophy.To be sure, the potential ceiling of their talent-laden roster has seemed high as well. But the worry appears to be that it will never be high enough  not when the specter of the Golden State Warriors, who defeated the Cavaliers in the finals last year, menaces any team that considers itself a contender.The Cavaliers, then, want to be better. They wish they were improving faster.We have 18 games left, and weve got to start getting ready, said Tyronn Lue, the teams coach. Were trying to run plays on the floor with guys not knowing them still. Thats tough to swallow, especially when youre doing them every day in shoot-around and practice. Weve got to start picking things up a lot faster.Lue was echoing sentiments that have proliferated around the Cavaliers locker room over the last few weeks.After the Cavaliers stumbled to a surprise loss to a severely depleted Memphis Grizzlies team at home on Monday, LeBron James said the team would not be ready for the playoffs if they started the next day. James characterized his team that night as one that was still learning.It was a surprising description of a first-place team with championship ambitions.Any anxiety that may exist around the Cavaliers organization, though, was not palpable inside the locker room on Thursday. They had notched their second win in a row in the second game of a difficult four-game road trip. They did so in a buzzy arena, where fans were treated to a throwback shootout between James and Kobe Bryant, who will retire upon the conclusion of the season.After the game, James sauntered around the room wearing a white towel and flip-flops. He peeked over the shoulder of a team staff member, who was looking at a picture from the game on his Instagram feed on his phone.In the picture, James was airborne, with the basketball cradled perilously in his left palm, his body contorted away from the rim. It was the most exciting play of the game: Streaming forward on a fast break, J. R. Smith had lobbed the ball to James off the backboard, but the pass went slightly awry. James dunked it anyway, reaching back behind his head to snatch the ball before slamming it in with his left hand.Thats ridiculous, James said, staring at the screen. I got to get that blown up in my house.James was walking around aimlessly, still fixated on the picture. Thats one of the best photos Ive ever seen, he said. Who captured that?Finally, James made a move for the showers.They say some of the worst lobs make the best dunks, he said, turning to Smith. You made the photo, Swish.If the Cavaliers have been subjected to heightened scrutiny this season, James has been at the root of it. Bryants retirement will confirm the ascent of James as the games foremost dignitary. Championship rings feel like a birthright for players of his caliber, but James is stuck for the moment at two, and the Warriors emergence as the leagues best team has complicated his pursuit of more.Over the last few weeks, James has been uploading cryptic posts to his social media accounts  he has almost 29 million followers on Twitter and almost 19 million on Instagram  with vague messages that read like fortune cookies.On March 6, he wrote on Twitter: Its this simple. U cant accomplished the dream if everyone isnt dreaming the same thing everyday. Nightmares follow.Later that day, he wrote: Structure and Consistency creates Perfection. U shortcut, u come up short! Straight Up.James has declined to explain these posts and others, inviting people to use their imagination. Some naturally thought the worst: that he might be unhappy with his current situation. He told reporters that his Twitter posts were not about his teammates, but he did not elaborate, so questions remain.I got a beautiful mind, and I want to use it sometimes in a social manner, James said about his messages this week.The Cavaliers finished Thursday two and a half games ahead of the Toronto Raptors in the conference standings. But a good record was never going to be enough to temper the intense scrutiny.The same pressure drove the Cavaliers to make a midseason coaching change, firing David Blatt when the team was 30-11 and atop the conference. David Griffin, the teams general manager, spoke then about forming winning principles, spirit and culture.Lue said he was still honing his rotation. He wanted his players to find a rhythm before the postseason. And amid everything else, the Cavaliers would like to give their players opportunities to rest before the playoffs.We have a long way to go, Lue said Thursday. We have a tough Eastern Conference. The playoffs, everyones saying were going to walk through it, but its not going to be that easy. Weve got to continue to get better each and every night, continue to grow, continue to compete for 48 minutes, and then well see what happens.The question remains whether any team in the East can challenge the Warriors.Early Thursday night, Byron Scott, the Lakers coach, shook his head and let out a quiet laugh. He and his players were four days removed from an unexpected home victory over the Warriors, and a reporter wondered whether there was some key to unlock the leagues best team.Scott did not need much time to ponder the question.I just dont see anybody really beating them in seven games, he said. To me, youve got to hope they have four subpar games, and youve got to have four really good ones.Such sustained ineffectiveness, from players like Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson, just does not seem possible, he added. Scott conceded that teams like the Cavaliers, San Antonio Spurs, Oklahoma City Thunder and Los Angeles Clippers might have some chance to topple the Warriors in the postseason.But he said, To me, that chance is not like 50-50, either. Theyre that good.For the Cavaliers, these were jarring, unmelodious sentiments."}
{"text": "One of the advertising industrys favorite buzzwords is branded content, the idea that marketing messages can be conveyed with special subtlety through the guise of entertainment or even journalism. But the concept often falls flat, as readers see through awkward advertorials and as the logos of eager corporate sponsors overtake pop-culture events like South by Southwest.And then there is Red Bull Music Academy.On its face, it should be objectionable, or at least annoying: An energy drink known for its association with extreme sports sponsors a highbrow music festival. But for 18 years, the event has built a rare kind of credibility, attracting otherwise elusive musical figures like Brian Eno, La Monte Young, Ryuichi Sakamoto and DAngelo, and drawing critical acclaim. Its existence seems proof that branded content can actually be good.The full academy  which includes concerts and an educational program  takes place in a different city each year, and this fall it will head to Montreal. But for a fourth straight year, a Red Bull Music Academy festival of live events will be held in New York, and the lineup for this years festival, from April 29 to May 22, is another impressive one.It includes a night of avant-garde jazz featuring Kamasi Washington, Pharoah Sanders and the Sun Ra Arkestra; a performance by Anohni (the vocalist formerly known as Antony, of Antony and the Johnsons); rare appearances by Diamanda Gals and Glenn Branca, giants of the 1980s downtown scene; the London rapper Dizzee Rascal performing his landmark 2003 album Boy in da Corner; and the Latin jazz artist Eddie Palmieri playing his 1971 record Harlem River Drive.Other events include a conversation on music and film with Spike Lee; a celebration of freestyle, the 1980s hybrid of hip-hop and dance music; and a collaboration with Bell Labs in tribute to Experiments in Art and Technology, the companys 1960s program linking technology and the arts.A complete schedule can be found at the festivals website, which will start selling tickets on March 24. And, lest anyone forget the brand behind the content, the events are sure to include plenty of Red Bull."}
{"text": "Ben H. Bagdikian, a journalist and news media critic who became a celebrated voice of conscience for his profession, calling for tougher standards of integrity and public service in an era of changing tastes and technology, died on Friday at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 96.His wife, Marlene Griffith Bagdikian, confirmed his death.Over five decades, Mr. Bagdikian was a national and foreign correspondent for newspapers and magazines; a reporter, editor and ombudsman for The Washington Post; the author of eight books; and for many years a professor and the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley.Born into an Armenian family that fled from genocide in Ottoman Turkey, he grew up in Depression America with a passion for social justice that shaped his reporting. He became an undercover inmate to expose inhumane prison conditions in Pennsylvania, rode with an Israeli tank crew to write about the 1956 Suez Crisis, and lived with oppressed families in the South to cover the civil rights struggle in the 1960s.He was The Washington Posts conduit for the Pentagon Papers, the secret Defense Department study of decades of American duplicity in Indochina that was disclosed by the military analyst Daniel Ellsberg and published by The Post and The New York Times in 1971 in defiance of the Nixon administrations attempts at suppression as the nation debated its deepening involvement in the war in Vietnam.But he was perhaps best known as the author of The Media Monopoly (1983), which warned that freedom of expression and independent journalism were threatened by the consolidation of news and entertainment outlets in a shrinking circle of corporate owners. A mere 50 companies, he wrote, controlled what most Americans read in newspapers and books and saw on television and at the movies.By 2004, when he published The New Media Monopoly, the last of seven sequel editions, the number of corporate giants controlling much of the flow of information and entertainment had dwindled to five. This gives each of the five corporations and their leaders more communications power than was exercised by any despot or dictatorship in history, Mr. Bagdikian wrote.Journalists, scholars, corporate officials and the public still debate the drawbacks and merits of limited media ownership. But the Internet and desktop publishing have extended freedom of speech to anyone with a computer. Cable networks and online news and entertainment choices have proliferated, and some observers contend that the Orwellian perils envisioned by Mr. Bagdikian have receded or become moot.While Mr. Bagdikian was most vociferous against ownership concentrations  calling for limits on the size of newspaper chains, for example, even if the limits ran afoul of the First Amendment  his news media criticism ranged widely. He examined conflicts of interest and journalistic integrity, legal issues affecting the press, the medias responsibility to act in the public interest, and trends in investigative reporting.He rebuked newspaper publishers who pressed journalists to promote advertisers interests, breaching the traditional wall between news and business. He was troubled by the wide use of anonymous sources in news reports, and by the credulity of reporters and editors who accepted the official accounts of self-serving government spokesmen, especially when facts were being suppressed on national security grounds.He urged tougher standards of public service for broadcasters seeking renewal of their licenses. He advised Americans not to rely on television networks for news, calling them one network in triplicate because of their similarities. And he especially deplored the celebrity status of television network anchors.The worst thing that can happen to a journalist is to become a celebrity, he told The Progressive in 1997. The honest job of the journalist is to observe, to listen, to learn. The job of the celebrity is to be observed, to make sure others learn about him or her, to be the object of attention rather than an observer.Ben Haig Bagdikian was born on Jan. 30, 1920, in Marash, Turkey, the youngest of five children of Aram Bagdikian, a chemistry teacher, and the former Daisy Uvezian. The family fled the massacre of Armenians when Ben was an infant and made its way to America, settling in Stoneham, Mass. His mother died when he was 3, and his father became pastor of an Armenian Congregational church in Cambridge.He graduated from Clark University in 1941 and worked briefly as a reporter for The Springfield Morning Union in Massachusetts. In 1942 he married Elizabeth Ogasapian. They had two sons, Christopher and Frederick, and were divorced in 1972. His second marriage, to Betty Medsger, ended in divorce. In 1983, he married Marlene Griffith. Besides her, he is survived by Frederick. Christopher died in 2015.After serving as a navigator in World War II, Mr. Bagdikian joined The Providence Journal and Evening Bulletin in Rhode Island in 1947. Over the next 15 years he was a local reporter, a member of a team that won the 1953 Pulitzer Prize for deadline coverage of a bank robbery, a foreign correspondent in the Middle East and a Washington correspondent.From 1963 to 1967 he was a Washington-based contributing editor of The Saturday Evening Post and wrote freelance articles about politics, poverty, housing, migration and other subjects for The New York Times Magazine and other publications. He also covered the civil rights movement, sometimes as a companion of victims of intimidation and violence.His first book, In the Midst of Plenty: The Poor in America, was published in 1964. His other books included The Information Machines: Their Impact on Men and the Media (1971), The Effete Conspiracy and Other Crimes by the Press (1972), and a memoir, Double Vision: Reflections on My Heritage, Life and Profession (1995).Frustrated by the sins and omissions of reporters and television crews at news events, he began writing media critiques in the 1960s after formulating a Bagdikian Law of Journalism: The accuracy of news reports of an event is inversely proportional to the number of reporters on the scene.Mr. Bagdikian studied the news media for the RAND Corporation from 1967 to 1969. After joining The Washington Post in 1970, he became an assistant managing editor and the ombudsman, representing the newspapers readers. From 1972 to 1974, he wrote for The Columbia Journalism Review. He taught journalism at Berkeley from 1976 until retiring in 1990, and was the graduate schools dean from 1985 to 1988.Never forget, he told his students at the outset, that your obligation is to the people. It is not, at heart, to those who pay you, or to your editor, or to your sources, or to your friends, or to the advancement of your career. It is to the public."}
{"text": "PHOENIX   Jurors on Friday began deliberating the fate of a Muslim convert accused of financing, training and motivating the two men who tried to attack an exhibit of anti-Islam cartoons last year in Texas. The assault was thwarted, leaving the gunmen dead after a shootout with the police.Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, a Phoenix resident whose name was originally Decarus Thomas, is accused of transporting guns across state lines, arming the attackers and training them to use the weapons, conspiring to support Islamic extremists and lying to federal agents. Mr. Kareem, 44, who served time in prison on a drunken-driving conviction, is also charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm.On May 3, Elton Simpson, 30, and Nadir Soofi, 34, drove from Phoenix to Garland, Tex., and opened fire outside the Curtis Culwell Center, targeting an exhibit of images that lampooned the Prophet Muhammad, an event meant to denigrate Islam. The gunmen injured a security guard.Mr. Kareem was not with the attackers. Still, Joseph E. Koehler, an assistant United States attorney, said during closing statements in Federal District Court here on Friday, he was the motivator, he was the bankroller, he was the trainer and an intended participant.Mr. Kareems lawyer, Daniel D. Maynard, argued that the federal government was trying to cast his client as guilty by association.What the government has done in this case is try to deal with your fears, the fears that we have about the unknown, about homegrown terrorism, Mr. Maynard said.Earlier this week, Mr. Kareem spent two days on the witness stand, asserting his innocence and denying any knowledge of the plans or of the cartoon exhibit. He told jurors about his past: He was born into a Baptist family in Philadelphia, his father worked as a police officer. Mr. Kareem, who owns a moving company, said he met Mr. Simpson and Mr. Soofi at Mr. Soofis pizzeria in West Phoenix in 2011. He said the three men prayed together and attended the same mosque.Mr. Kareem converted to Islam as an early adult, changing his name in 2013, after serving time in prison. Mr. Maynard said his client had an open-door policy at his home, inviting friends over after evening prayer or taking in those who needed a place to stay.Mr. Simpson lived with Mr. Kareem for several months, but he said they fought over Mr. Simpsons use of Mr. Kareems laptop to watch promotional videos for Al Qaeda.I did not want it in my house, Mr. Kareem told jurors, though he said he and Mr. Simpson had eventually reconciled.For three weeks, witnesses presented a contrasting image of a man who seemed at once kindhearted and angry.Sergio Martinez-Chavez, a friend of Mr. Kareems who testified for the prosecution, described him as pushy. Mr. Kareem called repeatedly one week, he said, asking if Mr. Martinez-Chavez could take him and his friends, Mr. Soofi and Mr. Simpson, target-shooting in the desert.Another government witness, a 13-year-old boy who lived across the street from Mr. Kareem and converted to Islam because of him, remembered hearing him say that if he had to hurt a kafir  a derogatory term for a person who is not Muslim  he would.A defense witness, Daniel Van Hook, a Christian friend of the defendants, said that Mr. Kareem had at times used the term kafir in a joking context. Terrorism experts said that this was the first case to go to trial for an act of violence inspired or ordered by the Islamic State. The groups precise role in the attack, if any, remained unclear.Mr. Maynard acknowledged the existence of a conspiracy  but one that did not involve Mr. Kareem. Simpson and Soofi were in a conspiracy, Mr. Maynard said.Prosecutors said Mr. Kareem had bought weapons and ammunition for Mr. Simpson and Mr. Soofi. Mr. Soofis brother, Ali, described Mr. Soofi in court as very gullible, very easily influenced. It was Mr. Kareem, Ali Soofi said, who taught the men to assemble and care for the weapons.On Friday, Mr. Koehler said, Its not just one thing, its a series of things that attest to Mr. Kareems intentions. For example, Mr. Koehler said, Mr. Kareem inquired about the amount of explosives needed to blow up a football stadium and a mall.Mr. Koehler reminded jurors of testimony from a witness who had heard Mr. Kareem saying he was so angry about the cartoon exhibit that he wanted to go there and just shoot them.But Mr. Maynard said that prosecutors were conflating Mr. Kareems story with that of Mr. Simpson and Mr. Soofi, whom he described as radicalized.Mr. Kareem, Mr. Maynard said, might have been a knucklehead, but his association with the Garland attackers does not make him part of the conspiracy."}
{"text": "VARIETY PUZZLE  I love a good cryptic, and this one did not disappoint. I have binged on this type of puzzle over the years, mainly solving from Harpers and Atlantic Monthly (those were magnificent puzzles, for years, by Emily Cox and Henry Rathvon). Rosalie Moscovitch, who passed away last November, constructed four other excellent cryptics for the Sunday Magazine,  and this one was also a treat.The cryptic originated in England a century ago, and that nation may still claim mastery of the art, but I can safely say that I nearly always limp away from British cryptic puzzles with the renewed belief that nobody who didnt attend a snooty boarding school there would ever be able to solve a whole grid.Im sure there are plenty of good solvers who shun the cryptic after seeing a few clues that seemed inscrutable. But if you have a mind for other word games, or even the Thursday puzzle every week, I encourage you to take a little time with cryptics and see if you catch the bug.Ive always thought that the easiest clues to answer in a cryptic are the container clues, where the answer is right in front of you, ordered correctly, like a nice multiple choice.  These are often evidence of a constructors cleverness at seeing hidden connections, and are indicated by words that indicate containment  like internalized, swallowed, inside  or, in the case of 3D, kept. If you look at the run of letters in this clue, Pocahontas kept somewhat focused at work, and you know youre in search of a two-, four-letter phrase, youll come to ON TASK pretty quickly. I think most of these clues will span two or more words, but sometimes the answer comes from completely within a longer word.  Theres another pure example of this at 9 across.The second thing I go for is the anagrams, and theyre usually fairly apparent. First, look carefully at the language of the clue for any words indicating chaos or disorder  in this puzzle, excitedly in 15A, bananas in 25A and snarled in 29A are all examples. Then, check the letter count in the clue words against the answer. Lets look at 29A:  Rod loves bananas and peddled too many, eight letters. As a sentence, its nonsensical. But if you use bananas as a signal to potentially anagram, and notice that ROD LOVES is eight letters, then you can deduce that RODLOVES, anagrammed, is peddled too many, or OVERSOLD.If you just use those two weapons, you can attack a grid like this with some success, and there are lots of other gambits that make a cryptic a cryptic that are similarly constant and logical, once youve figured them out.Then, of course, there are always some next-level clues, of varying degrees of brilliance. I loved 27A for its misdirection  instead of a sign to anagram, crazy in this instance equaled MENTAL, so you got Dorothys aunt EM, MENTAL about Hot, which became EMMENTHAL. I also had to chew over 16D for a good while  Shout could have indicated a homonym clue, but in this case it was a synonym of YELL, added to OW (now, with one third off) and FIN, crosswordese for five dollars. 6D, on the other hand, was a mild example of one of those Britishisms  Shortly cycling was actually an anagram, which reordered, around E for English, became HOSTELRY, a term I have seldom seen and never used.What did you think?"}

{"text": "UNITED NATIONS   Two rivals for power in South Sudan are accused by the United Nations of not only drawing their people into one of the worlds most gruesome wars, but also subjecting the countrys women and girls to unspeakable horrors.A report issued Friday singled out government forces loyal to President Salva Kiir for systematically using sexual violence to terrorize civilians, including what it called credible reports that soldiers were given license to rape in lieu of wages. Rebel forces loyal to his rival, Riek Machar, also committed atrocities against women, the report said, though not on the same scale.So why are their wives being hosted in New York later this month by the very arm of the United Nations system devoted to promoting gender equity, known as U.N. Women?That question surfaced this week with the announcement of an event co-sponsored by U.N. Women and scheduled to take place on the sidelines of the Commission on the Status of Women to discuss the contributions women are making to the ongoing peace process in South Sudan.The panel includes Mr. Kiirs wife, Mary Ayen Mayardit, and Mr. Machars wife, Angelina Teny. They are scheduled to speak on Thursday at the International Peace Institute, a think tank that often hosts events related to the United Nations. The announcement does not mention the human rights abuses in South Sudan that have been documented by United Nations investigators.In an email, Phumzile Mlambo Ngcuka, the executive director of U.N. Women, said that her office condemned the horrendous violence against women and girls in South Sudan, and that the perpetrators of the appalling attacks on women and girls must be brought to justice.Ms. Mlambo Ngcuka went on to add that her office would engage with women on all sides of the divide to bring an end to violence and collaborate for a sustainable peace in South Sudan.The event focused on South Sudan during the current Commission of the Status of Women aims to foster dialogue to that end, she said. It will provide an opportunity for South Sudanese women to engage with peace actors from all over the world, sharing experiences and lessons learned.The civil war began in 2013, barely two years after the country gained independence from Sudan, with backing from the United States. At least 50,000 people have been killed so far, and the United Nations says that at least two million people have been forced to flee their homes. The United Nations envoy on sexual violence in conflicts, Zainab Bangura, has spoken of rampant sexual violence, including rapes of children, in South Sudan.The rival leaders agreed last August to set up a transitional government, but they have yet to do so.Human rights advocates, both inside and outside the United Nations, said they were appalled that the two women were being included in the event.The U.N.s decision to spotlight these two women as peacemakers is out of step with the realities that their husbands constituents face on a daily basis back in South Sudan, said Akshaya Kumar, the deputy United Nations director for Human Rights Watch, in an email on Friday. By elevating the voices of the wives of two men  who the U.N.s own human rights monitors have identified as orchestrating the abusive violence  events like this one weaken the broader movement to guarantee women a place at the peace negotiations table more globally.Ms. Teny is a veteran South Sudan politician and served as a minister in the government of national unity from 2005 to 2010, before South Sudan won its independence from Sudan.Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka will deliver the closing remarks at the event."}
{"text": "A Broadway actress has taken the rare step of publicly challenging the tone of anonymous online comment boards where theater lovers exchange news, gossip and opinions, often with a heavy dose of snark.Patti Murin, who was to star in a Broadway musical called Nerds this spring, on Thursday posted a lengthy cri de coeur objecting to some of the comments on a chat board run by BroadwayWorld in the hours after the show, about Steve Jobs and Bill Gates, was canceled. One commenter said of an actor, I hope hes not playing either Jobs or Gates because neither of them are mentally retarded. Another described the show, which had not yet begun previews (although it had been staged elsewhere in previous years) as terrible, and yet another said that Ms. Murin was not capable of hitting a high C (which Ms. Murin denies in colorful language that cannot be reprinted here).Ms. Murin, who starred in the Broadway production of Lysistrata Jones, wrote that she appreciated the role chat boards play in allowing theater fans to talk to one another, but objected to what she called a cesspool of ignorance and negativity:The theater community is small, and the BroadwayWorld chat board, which has had six million messages since it was started in 2003, claims to be the largest for theater fans. The website, which is independently owned by its founder, Robert Diamond, has news, features and listings about theater in multiple cities. Mr. Diamond said that the chat board participants are a wide variety of people that range from Tony-winning performers to 14-year-olds in Kansas City, and said the forum was established to create a place for those of us that didnt grow up with theater-loving friends to chat about the things we were obsessing about.Although some chatters on the board disputed Ms. Murins critique, arguing that the comments she objected to werent that mean or that they constituted legitimate discussion about public figures and publicly performed shows, she drew immediate support from some other actors.The singer Orfeh, who was nominated for a Tony for her role in Legally Blonde, took to Instagram to echo Ms. Murins critique, but also to say that BroadwayWorld had earlier helped her deal with harassment on the sites chat board. Thanks for opening this back up, @PattiMurin, and saying what Ive wanted to express for almost a decade, she said.Mr. Diamond responded quickly. Although the site has long had moderators removing abusive posts (and removed the Nerds comment using the word retarded), within a few hours of Ms. Murins essay, he said he had implemented a change, making it easier for registered users to report abuse.Mr. Diamond said that he did not agree with Ms. Murins initial suggestion that the chat board be separated from the theater website. If we were to remove them, those discussions would move to one of the darker corners of the Internet that are less open to connection and dialogue, he said. But he and Ms. Murin are planning to have lunch on Saturday to discuss her concerns.On Friday evening, BroadwayWorld posted a lengthy response to the concerns expressed, saying that not only had the company made it easier to report abusive comments, but that it had also taken steps to separate chat boards from the rest of its content, had added moderators, and would host a benefit concert to raise awareness about online bullying."}

Later, I knew, wed meet for drinks and celebration, but the day was early and I was thrilled, imagining her pleasure in her hard-won achievement.I AM SO EXCITEDDDDDDD, I wrote, and as with any message of sincere and unparalleled sentiment, I thought to include emojis: the party hat, the airborne confetti, the two tumblers of light beer clinking. I sent these enthusiastically. Then I sent them again.YOU DID IT! I wrote, following up with a unicorn. My friend was a rare and beautiful beast, yes  bounding over the mountainsides of academia.But when she didnt respond  she was busy, I reasoned, what with being a now tenured unicorn  I began to wonder: Why a unicorn? Was she not, after all, a woman  a medieval environmentalist, a scholar whose work involved saints and conflicts and the power of places? She taught a class titled Castles & Cathedrals that had a waiting list as long as an Ohio winter.Why, just months earlier, shed spent a whole Saturday in a Panera Bread, translating Latin, hoping to find a firsthand account of anything remotely involving dolphins.She was markedly a woman. She was by no means a unicorn. Where was the emoji for her?I began to scroll through the emojis on my phone. Yes, there were womens faces, and tiny womens bodies. But for the women actually engaged in an activity or profession, there were only archetypes: the flamenco dancer in her red gown, the bride in her flowing veil, the princess in her gold tiara. There was a set of ballet dancers complete with bunny ears and black leotards, their smiles indicating that, gosh, they were so grateful to God and everyone, really, for this opportunity to pose for Playboy. There was a woman getting her hair cut, and another with her arm out, Valley Girl, osmosis ditz, as if to say, Tenure? What is tenure? That sounds like an injury! Ow-i!Where, I wanted to know, was the fierce professor working her way to tenure?Where was the lawyer? The accountant? The surgeon? How was there space for both a bento box and a single fried coconut shrimp, and yet women were restricted to a smattering of tired, beauty-centric roles?This was not a problem for our male emoji brethren. Men were serving on the police force, working construction and being Santa. Meanwhile, on our phones, it was Saturday at the Mall of America  women shopping while men wrote the checks.We are told we are the new generation of American women; no longer a minority, we are, in fact, the majority of breadwinners in American homes. And yet the best we can get is the flamenco.Indeed, its the flamenco dancer I find I send most often when a friend has achieved greatness. Her one arm in the air, she suggests an attitude of self-assurance, of cool-minded confidence.Flamenco! I sent recently when a friend sold her book for $50,000.Flamenco! I sent when another secured a grant to conduct research in Ireland.Flamenco! I sent when another broke up with her boyfriend who had, for months, been eating all her food.Flamenco! Flamenco! Flamenco! You are impressive and you are kicking butt!But now my friend had tenure, and the flamenco was not enough. My friend had not danced her way to the provosts office, had not shimmied her tweed-blazered body into scholarly stardom. Nothing about her achievement was choreographed; nor was she concerned about her hair, her nails, her smile. At times, in fact, I trust she was frowning. She had put in long hours and designed new courses and sat through so many meetings. She had spent every one of the past 10 summers in libraries and had graded several thousand papers, writing  more times than I care to imagine  Proofread! and Word choice!And she had done this knowing the odds were against her. In most professions, women make less than men, but in academia this pay gap is compounded by the fact that women tend to spend more uncompensated time advising students while also being subjected to student evaluations that studies show are consistently biased against them. Female academics are promoted at much slower rates, and fewer still choose to stay in the field as a result, and even fewer, then, are even present when the time for tenure comes. Perhaps its no surprise that men hold three-quarters of full professorships within the United States.When my friend and I met up for drinks, we talked about this disparity, and the smaller one on our screens. Scrolling through the options, we rejected the dancer and the unicorn and, in lieu of anything else, settled on a penguin. My friend was, we agreed, a penguin. Not a creature of mythical imagination, but something real. Id read, I told her, a recent report about several hundred thousand penguins trapped by a collapsed glacier in Antarctica. Thousands had died, but the ones that survived did so only through perseverance  regularly traveling some 40 miles across barren nothingness to reach the ocean.She, and the women like her, we agreed, were creatures that persevered like crazy, and often against all odds.There we were, two penguins, in our business black and white, talking about tenure and the future of America, how we were educating the very students we hoped would inspire further change.Penguin, penguin, penguin. I send it to her often and will until we tire. Penguin, penguin, penguin."}

Agatha Christies dark 1939 novel, adapted in this four-part mini-series (which originally aired on the BBC), tells the story of 10 people trapped on an island, who die one by one according to a twisted nursery rhyme. Mike Hale, reviewing the series in The New York Times, wrote, When one of the 10 asks, Is there something a tad off here?, fans of Ms. Christies cozy mysteries may nod vigorously, wondering why theyre watching an artsy, darkly humorous psychological horror story instead of a comforting whodunit. Fans of Sunday night television may recognize a familiar face in the cast: Charles Dance, who played the ruthless patriarch Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones.

The Metropolitan Opera assembled what the chief classical music critic for The Times, Anthony Tommasini, called an exceptional cast for its revival of Wagners Tannhuser last fall, broadcast now on television. Johan Botha stars as the titular character, a knight minstrel in spiritual crisis, and Eva-Maria Westbroek is the young princess in love with him. Also a standout is the baritone Peter Mattei as another knight in love with the princess.

{"text": "Q. Id like to do something more the week of St. Patricks Day than watch a parade. Would you know of any Manhattan tour focusing on Irish-American history?A. Try the Irish Outsiders tour, which is offered seven days a week by the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, whose visitor center is at 103 Orchard Street on the corner of Delancey Street. Tickets are $25 for adults and $20 for students and people over 65. The museum itself is a five-story former tenement building at 97 Orchard.The tour, one of several offered by the museum, is free to museum members. The museum recommends buying tickets online in advance, because the tours often sell out. The number of Irish tours and their times vary from day to day; each has a maximum of 15 people. People can buy tickets online at tenement.org or by calling 877-975-3786.The Irish Outsiders tour has been revised to focus on Irish immigrant identity and St. Patricks Day. The tour used to be a much more somber affair, including the scene of a wake and a childs coffin. That is gone. This was the only tour we offered at the museum that schoolchildren were not allowed to take, Jon Pace, a spokesman for the museum, said. The museum recommends the new tour for anyone age 8 and over. (The museum gets 55,000 visits by children a year, Mr. Pace said.)On the tour, visitors see a recreated rear yard, which was 97 Orchards only source of water in 1869, when Bridget and Joseph Moore lived there. Ms. Moore and her young children would have spent time in the rear yard doing laundry and gathering water to bring upstairs for cooking and cleaning.Visitors then go to the fourth floor of the tenement, where the Moores had their apartment. The apartment is furnished to reflect the day after St. Patricks Day in 1869. An educator tells the story of the immigrant experience, and the history of the St. Patricks Day Parade, through exhibits and the music of Irish America.Newspaper accounts describe the way in which the parade took over the city and halted traffic, as over 100,000 came to celebrate, Annie Polland, the museums vice president for programs and education, said in an email. When the parade passed City Hall, Mayor A. O. Hall, clad in a green suit, watched from a specially constructed platform.Dr. Polland added, While Bridget and Joseph were one of just two Irish families at 97 Orchard, the Irish composed 25 percent of the citys population, and one could argue that on that day, they felt like insiders."}

At 2-2 in the second set, the umpire Damien Dumusois docked Kyrgios a point for using foul language.Muguruza, who reached the Wimbledon final last year and finished at No. 3 in the world, has struggled early this season and said a few days ago that she needed a good deal more work on her game. She made a few dozen mistakes against McHale, who was No. 24 in the world before a bout of mononucleosis derailed her late in 2012.

{"text": "Though you can still see the recesses in the walls where the hinges of the portals once hung, the Venice ghetto has not been a prison since Napoleon seized the city and tore down the gates in 1797. Today, no barrier or signpost marks where Venice ends and its ghetto begins. Cross a canal on an arched bridge, duck through a sottoportego (an alley tunneling through a building), disappear down a vent in the urban fabric  you come and go just like everywhere else in the maze of this island city.But linger long enough in the Campo di Ghetto Nuovo, the generous, frayed, tree-flecked plaza that anchors this corner of Cannaregio (the quiet northwest quadrant of the city) and youll feel the wall of the past closing in. Half a millennium of history does not transpire without stamping the soul of a place.Established by decree of Doge Leonardo Loredan on March 29, 1516, the Venice ghetto was one of the first places where people were forcibly segregated and surveilled because of religious difference. The term itself originated here; the area had been used as a foundry (geto in Venice dialect) and over time the neighborhoods polyglot residents corrupted the word to ghetto.I traveled to La Serenissima in December to see how the city was gearing up for the anniversary of the establishment of the ghetto. A major exhibition called Venice, the Jews and Europe: 1516 to 2016 (on view from June 19 to Nov. 13) was being planned for the Ducal Palace, and during the last week of July, Shakespeares Merchant of Venice will be staged (in English) for the first time in the confines where its most hallucinatory scenes take place. Venice being Venice, there will also be glittering parties, celebrity-filled fund-raisers and fancy dress galas, starting with the invitation-only performance of Mahlers First Symphony at La Fenice opera house on March 29.But in the course of my visit, what I became most curious about was the mood of the current Jewish community of 450 people. Venice is such an impossibly beautiful fantasy, it seems astonishing that ordinary people, Jews among them, actually live there. How, I wondered, did deep-rooted Jewish families feel about their past  and future  in this ancient, vulnerable city?My first answer came inside the humble, rectangular sanctuary of the circa-1532 Scuola Canton, one of five synagogues still standing in the ghetto. The synagogues are open to the public only as part of guided tours offered by the Jewish Museum of Venice, and that morning just three of us (two other Americans and I) had signed up for the 10:30 tour in English. We were standing with our guide, Silvia Crepaldi, admiring the golden spiraling tree-trunk columns that support the arch over the bimah (podium), when the subject of rising sea levels came up.The city will be empty before it sinks, Ms. Crepaldi said ruefully. Venice is shrinking before our eyes.The urban exodus of both Jews and gentiles has been going on for some time, though the pace has accelerated in recent years.When the ghetto was at its height in the 17th century, 5,000 Jews from Italy, Germany, France, Spain and the Ottoman Empire carved out tiny, distinct fiefs, each maintaining its own synagogue, all of them crammed into an acre and a quarter of alleys and courtyards. Confinement was a burden, but it also provided an opportunity for cultural exchange unparalleled in the diaspora. As Jan Morris, a Venice devotee and one-time resident, writes in The World of Venice, the city was a treasure-box full of ivory, spices, scents, apes, ebony, indigo, slaves, great galleons, Jews, mosaics, shining domes, rubies, and all the gorgeous commodities of Arabia, China and the Indies.Jewish merchants and bankers were vital to the flow of these commodities, but as Venice declined, the Jewish presence dwindled. By the outbreak of the Second World War, Jewish Venice had shrunk to 1,200 residents. Today, with the citys total population hovering around 58,000 (down from 150,000 before the war), there are about 450 Venetian Jews left, only a handful of them residing in the ghetto.So now the ghetto is just a shell? I wondered aloud as Ms. Crepaldi led us across the campo, over a bridge, down a street of intriguing-looking shops, and into a tighter, grimmer square (the Campiello delle Scuole or little square of the synagogues), flanked by the two Sephardic scuole.The answer to my question was revealed inside one of these: the sumptuous Scuola Grande Spagnola (Great Spanish Synagogue), possibly the work of Baldassare Longhena, the renowned 17th-century architect of Santa Maria della Salute. After we had gazed our fill at the elliptical coffered ceiling and the black-columned pediment that frames the ark of the covenant; after we had craned our necks to glimpse the cherry wood balustrade and diamond-hatched panels that screen the upstairs womens gallery; after our eyes had bathed in the silver gleam of candelabra and the soft glow of crimson-curtained bottle-glass window panes, Ms. Crepaldi pointed to the brass plaques affixed to the pews. These are the names of families who pay to rent their own bench sections, she told us. These families still pray here. This synagogue is used in summer, and in winter they switch to the Scuola Levantina because its heated. The Venetian Jewish community may be small, but its still strong.Calimani and Sullam  two of the surnames inscribed on those plaques  appeared in tiny letters by the buzzer I pressed at 10 oclock the next morning. Riccardo Calimani, the esteemed historian of Italian Jewry and the author of a book about the Venetian ghetto, had given me very precise directions to his home off the Strada Nuova (a rare rectilinear thoroughfare stocked with shops catering more to residents than tourists).What Mr. Calimani had neglected to say in his email is that he lives in a palace: a light-bedazzled, soaring-ceilinged, art- and book-lined Renaissance suite overlooking the Grand Canal. As he ushered me into his princely study, the ample, urbane Mr. Calimani struck me as a kind of latter-day Jewish doge.My fathers family arrived in Venice from the north of Italy in 1508, he said, slowing his Italian down to a tempo I could follow. My ancestor Simone Calimani was the author of a trattato morale [moral treatise], printed in the 18th century when Jewish publishing was flourishing here. My grandfather was the cantor in the Scuola Levantina, even though our roots are not Levantine but Italian and German. The Venetian history of the Calimani family, I realized, coincides almost exactly with the history of the ghetto.The palace belongs to his wifes family, the Sullams, Spanish Jews who took refuge in Venice after the expulsion from the Iberian Peninsula at the end of the 15th century. I knew, from reading Mr. Calimanis The Ghetto of Venice (1988), that Italian and German Jews, the first and poorest to settle in Venice, had been consigned to selling rags and running pawnshops, while the great merchants of Venice were later arrivals from Spain and the Levant.With tantalizing fragrances wafting out of the hidden kitchen and the velvety light of winter burnishing thousands of leather spines, I could practically taste the history that had made this room possible. The palace may be extraordinary, but the convergence of cosmopolitan currents in the Calimani/Sullam household is quintessentially Venetian.Their families abandonment of the ghetto is also typical. As soon as the ghetto was abolished in 1797, Jews with means fled the high-rise tenements  the tallest buildings with the lowest-ceilinged apartments in Venice  for more elegant, and spacious, parts of the city. But the ghetto remained the anchor of Venetian Jewry. Since travel by gondola was deemed permissible on the Sabbath, the observant had no trouble floating back each week to pray at the scuola of their choice.Today, the Jews of Venice, though still a proud (if dispersed) community, are invisible. (The black-garbed Hasids you see in the campo are not Venetian but followers of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement who have resettled here from other parts of Europe and the United States.) Mr. Calimani, like every local Jew I spoke to, said he moves unremarked in and out of Jewish circles. The Venice ghetto, he told me, was always more open to the city than the Roman ghetto, which was beset by the conversion mania of the church.The dispersal of the community had the unexpected benefit of sending me into unfamiliar neighborhoods in pursuit of interviews. I had been in Venice twice before, but far from growing accustomed to its gorgeous strangeness, I found it endlessly fascinating just to thread the maze, and inevitably get lost in it, on my way to appointments.The Airbnb my wife, daughter and I rented just off Campo SS. Giovanni e Paolo  the heart of Castello, a still quasi-authentic quarter of working families, schools, neighborhood bars and the municipal hospital  is perhaps half a mile as the crow flies from the flat of Donatella Calabi, a professor of urban history who curated the exhibition Venice, the Jews and Europe: 1516 to 2016. But even though Ms. Calabi had emailed me a map with arrows pointing the way, it still required several forays across the nearby Campo Santa Maria Formosa before I hit on just the right calle (street in the Venetian dialect).No matter; it just gave me more angles from which to admire this perfect urban plaza with an austere whitewashed church rising in the center and a perimeter of magnificently crumbling palaces now occupied by restaurants, hotels, banks and the delightful 16th-century house-museum of the Fondazione Querini Stampalia.As we sat by the windows of her top-floor apartment watching the dome of San Marco go gray against the December dusk, Ms. Calabi spoke with animation of the coming exhibition at the Ducal Palace. The ghetto provided an incredible occasion for cultural exchange she said, and the exhibit will focus on that exchange within the ghetto itself, between the ghetto and the city, and with the rest of Europe. Artworks including Carpaccios Predica di Santo Stefano (St. Stephens sermon) on loan from the Louvre, virtual reconstructions of the ghetto in various periods, and sacred books will conjure up the rich complexity of this exchange.Ms. Calabi became more somber when the conversation turned to the present. Renaissance scholar Francesco Sansovino wrote that for the Jews, Venice was quasi una vera terra di promissione  practically a true promised land, she said. But today Jewish Venice is a small community within a small city. The 500th anniversary is an occasion not to celebrate  you dont have a festival for a ghetto  but to commemorate. An unbroken stretch of 500 years of history will not happen again soon.I heard similar sentiments voiced later in the week at a packed meeting of an informal discussion group that gathers at intervals to consider issues pertinent to Venetian Jewry. The members had assembled that night in a pretty little house on a canal in Cannaregio near the Gesuiti Church, a Baroque pile that presides over a quarter once inhabited by artisans and artists (Titian and Tintoretto among them). My Italian, though not quite up to the rapid flow of ideas, was good enough to register the passion and erudition that these 30 or so men and women brought to a discussion of their deeply rooted community.Amos Luzzatto, an esteemed Venetian-Jewish intellectual and the past president of the Jewish Community of Venice, was present, and we chatted for a few minutes about the small Jewish cemetery on the Lido, the beit midrash (study room) named for his family that is still in use in the ghetto, and the book by his renowned ancestor Rabbi Simchah Luzzatto that I had spotted in the Jewish Museum.I didnt have a chance to ask Mr. Luzzatto how he felt about the state of the ghetto today, but as I picked my way back to SS. Giovanni e Paolo through deserted echoing alleys and over black filaments of water, I thought of a comment he had made in a recent interview posted on YouTube: The ghetto today belongs to the city of Venice  it does not belong to the Jews. The ghetto has become part of the panorama of Venice.The panorama was its most ravishing the day I met Venices head rabbi, Scialom Bahbout, for lunch in the campo. Maybe it was the dazzle of another clear December day or the adrenaline of the holidays (Hanukkah was ending, Christmas still a week away), but the campo, which had struck me as rather forlorn on prior trips, now looked like a stage set waiting for a play. (In fact, this summers production of The Merchant of Venice will be staged right here, notes Shaul Bassi, a professor at the University of Venice who is spearheading the production.)Mothers pushed strollers in and out of shadows cast by the teetering ghetto skyscrapers. Booted and scarfed Venetians clicked their heels across a bridge and disappeared into the inviting trattorias that line the fondamenta (bank) of the Rio della Misericordia canal. A small knot of tourists hovered by the entrance to the Jewish Museum, a charming warren of rooms stuffed with precious objects and books (and slated for a major makeover later this year under the aegis of Venetian Heritage, an international organization dedicated to preserving the citys cultural riches). I had just enough time before lunch to duck down an alley and browse the elegant Judaica pieces in glass and gold at Arte Ebraica Shalom.The one jarring note was the makeshift police booth at the far end of the campo. Though there have been no attacks here, the booth is staffed around the clock by Italian police, rarely seen elsewhere in Venice, and the Jewish community has brought in its own private Israeli security guard. The juxtaposition of the armed police and the two Holocaust memorials (a series of bronze reliefs on either side of the Jewish old-age home that encloses one side of the campo) is apt. During the Nazi occupation, some 250 Venetian Jews, including its beloved chief rabbi Adolfo Ottolenghi, were seized from the ghetto and elsewhere in the city and sent to Auschwitz and a Trieste concentration camp. Eight returned.The conversation touched only briefly on the Holocaust in the course of my leisurely lunch with the rabbi at Ghimel Garden, the popular kosher restaurant that opened recently beside the old-age home. Davide Federici, a local journalist, and the Venetian sculptor Giorgio Bortoli were present, and Rabbi Bahbout, who is highly regarded after two years in the community, seemed entirely in his element as the talk rambled around art, politics, history, cinema and food.Did you know sarde in saor  sweet and sour sardines, a ubiquitous winter appetizer in Venice  is typically Jewish? the rabbi asked as the first round of plates appeared beside our glasses of prosecco. I was aware of the influence of ancient Jewish recipes on Roman cuisine, but it never occurred to me there was anything Jewish about the food of Venice, where shellfish (not kosher) figures in so many dishes. Id also never seen an Orthodox rabbi sipping prosecco.By the time the pasta arrived, the conversation had moved on to the rabbis dream project: a Jewish university in Venice. The challenge today is to sustain the vivacity of our culture and carry it into the future. What better way than with an international Jewish university? In Venice today, conservation tends to dominate other concerns  but what we really need is to construct the next 500 years.The rabbis American-born wife, Lenore Rosenberg Bahbout, joined us for pinza, a thrifty confection of stale bread and spice. We were chuckling about all the celebrities (Barbra Streisand, Donna Karan, Diane von Furstenberg, Barry Diller) whom Toto Bergamo Rossi, the charming director of Venetian Heritage, had tapped to fund the ghetto restoration project. Its wonderful, said Mrs. Bahbout. But it would be even more wonderful if this money could be used to restore the soul of the ghetto.I contemplated the soul that Saturday morning, my last in Venice, at the Shabbat service in the Scuola Levantina. The high, dim sanctuary was about a quarter full, perhaps 40 men scattered around the benches that ran the length of the room between the massively carved bimah and the red-curtained ark of the covenant, with 15 or so women peering down at us from the upstairs gallery.Id been in Venice less than a week, but already I recognized faces  Paolo Gnignati, the current president of the Jewish community; Elly, the strapping Israeli security guard who had warned no cellphones  theyre Orthodox! before letting me enter the synagogue; and of course Rabbi Bahbout, distinguished and elegant in his fedora as he chanted the Sephardic liturgy.Every Venetian I spoke to, Jew and gentile alike, had expressed deep pessimism about the citys future. But as I sat in this sacred space in the hushed, carless city, listening to the Hebrew prayers and Italian murmur, I felt reassured, not discouraged, by the evidence of time. Since the ghetto was first established, doges, merchant princes, Shylock, Napoleon, the Austrians, the Nazis have come and gone (and in Shylocks case, will soon return). Through that half-millennium of history, Jews have gathered on Sabbath mornings like this one at the serene cusp of winter to pray and gossip in the Venice ghetto.The website of the Jewish Community of Venice, veniceghetto500.org/?lang=en, has the latest information about events planned for the anniversary year. The Venetian Heritage Council, vh-council.org, is in charge of the coming restoration of the Jewish Museum and the ghetto synagogues.Venice, the Jews and Europe: 1516 to 2016 will be on view at the Ducal Palace (veniceghetto500.org/la-mostra/?lang=en, Piazza San Marco) from June 19 to Nov. 13. Tickets are 19 euros (about $20) and can be purchased online.The Merchant of Venice will be performed outdoors in the Campo di Ghetto Nuovo on July 26, 27, 28, 29, and 31, with a rain date on Aug. 1. The production, in English, is being staged through a partnership between Compagnia de Colombari theater company (colombari.org/#!home/c1pbl) and CaFoscari University of Venice. For tickets and further information, see themerchantinvenice.org.The Jewish Museum of Venice is open from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Oct. 1 to May 31 and until 7 p.m. from June 1 to Sept. 30. Hourly guided tours of the synagogues (in Italian and English) start at 10:30 ( museum admission is 4; museum and synagogue tour is 10). The museum also offers tours of the Jewish cemetery on the Lido, with advance booking. Closed Saturdays and Jewish holidays. For more information, museoebraico.it/english/museo.html.The Kosher in Venice website, kosherinvenice.com, lists kosher restaurants, hotels and food shops in the ghetto, including Ristorante Ghimel Garden, the recently opened Giardino dei Melograni guesthouse, and Panificio Volpe Giovanni, a bakery and grocery."}
{"text": "The York Theater Company has a new(ish) philosophy for Youre a Good Man, Charlie Brown: Cast it with children.The show, of course, has been widely staged with performers of all ages since it was a hit off Broadway nearly 50 years ago. But the big New York productions  the original was on Broadway (briefly) in 1971, and a revised version (with Tony-winning performances by Roger Bart and Kristin Chenoweth) in 1999  have been done with adults.Now the York, saying it was inspired by a concert version at Feinsteins/54 Below using child actors drawn from the casts of Broadway shows, plans to try to replicate that casting approach in a limited run starting May 24 and ending June 26. Casting is not yet completed, but the theater said it was seeking the authority only possible from performers close in age to the characters they are portraying.The show, with book, music and lyrics by Clark Gesner and additional material by Andrew Lippa, will be directed by Michael Unger, who is the associate artistic director at York. The musical is adapted from the long-running Peanuts comic strip by Charles M. Schulz.Jennifer Tepper, the programming director at 54 Below, said the production would be the first conceived for 54 Below that then had an Off Broadway run."}
{"text": "AS the director of the human brain bank at the National Institute of Mental Health, I am surrounded by brains, some floating in jars of formalin and others icebound in freezers. As part of my work, I cut these brains into tiny pieces and study their molecular and genetic structure. My specialty is schizophrenia, a devastating disease that often makes it difficult for the patient to discern what is real and what is not. I examine the brains of people with schizophrenia whose suffering was so acute that they committed suicide. I had always done my work with great passion, but I dont think I really understood what was at stake until my own brain stopped working.In the first days of 2015, I was sitting at my desk when something freakish happened. I extended my arm to turn on the computer, and to my astonishment realized that my right hand disappeared when I moved it to the right lower quadrant of the keyboard. I tried again, and the same thing happened: The hand disappeared completely as if it were cut off at the wrist. It felt like a magic trick  mesmerizing, and totally inexplicable. Stricken with fear, I kept trying to find my right hand, but it was gone.I had battled breast cancer in 2009 and melanoma in 2012, but I had never considered the possibility of a brain tumor. I knew immediately that this was the most logical explanation for my symptoms, and yet I quickly dismissed the thought. Instead I headed to a conference room. My colleagues and I had a meeting scheduled to review our new data on the molecular composition of schizophrenia patients frontal cortex, a brain region that shapes who we are  our thoughts, emotions, memories. But I couldnt focus on the meeting because the other scientists faces kept vanishing. Thoughts about a brain tumor crept quietly into my consciousness again, then screamed for attention.The M.R.I. scan later that day showed that I indeed had a small brain tumor that was bleeding and blocking my right visual field. I was told it was metastatic melanoma and given what was, in effect, a death sentence. I was a scientist, a triathlete, a wife, mother and grandmother. Then one day my hand vanished, and it was over.Almost right away, I had brain surgery, which removed the tumor and the blood. I quickly regained my vision. Unfortunately, new lesions were popping up throughout my brain, small but persistent. I started getting radiation treatments. In the spring, I entered an immunotherapy clinical trial. It was shortly before the end of this treatment that my brain really went awry.It was difficult, at first, to pinpoint the changes in my behavior, because they came on slowly. I didnt suddenly become someone else. Rather, some of my normal traits and behaviors became exaggerated and distorted, as if I were turning into a caricature of myself. I had always been very active, but now I was rushing about frantically. I had no time for anything  not even for the things that I really enjoyed, like talking to my children and my sister on the telephone. I would cut them off midsentence, running somewhere to do something of great importance, though what exactly, I couldnt say. I became rude, and snapped at anyone who threatened to distract me. I would read a paragraph and forget it instantly. I got lost driving home from work on a route I had taken for decades. I went running in the woods outside my house, barely dressed.Strangely, I wasnt worried. Like so many patients with mental illness, whose brains I had studied for a lifetime, I was losing my grasp on reality.I came up with elaborate justifications for my behavior. I had reasons for everything I did, and even if I couldnt articulate these reasons, my certainty that they existed reinforced my belief that I was perfectly sane. I kept sending my doctor detailed emails about how great I was feeling. I was excited that I had completed immunotherapy. I felt certain that there was nothing wrong with my brain. This wasnt just wishful thinking, or extreme denial; my worldview made perfect sense to me. I still saw myself as a scientist  a master of the rational  and was in fact still working hard on other peoples brains, not able to see that my own was crashing.One day, when I was acting particularly strangely, my family took me to the emergency room. A brain scan showed many new tumors, inflammation and severe swelling. My frontal cortex was especially affected. I had studied this area of the brain for 30 years; I knew what that kind of swelling meant, and yet I showed no interest in the scans. Instead, I believed that my doctor and my family were scheming behind my back and making a mistake by giving in to unreasonable panic. I was frustrated that no one saw the world as clearly as I did.Despite my conviction that there was nothing really wrong with me, I took the drugs that were prescribed. Steroids reduced the swelling and inflammation. Then the visible tumors were destroyed by radiation. I was also placed on a new drug regimen intended to kill the melanoma cells in my body. Gradually my brain began to work again. Memories started coming back, as if I had awakened from a deep sleep. I could tell the days apart. I could find my way home from work. I began apologizing left and right for my strange actions and insensitive behavior. But the more I remembered, the more frightened I was that I might lose my mind again.The underlying causes of mental illness are rarely as clear as metastatic brain cancer. And yet I felt I understood for the first time what many of the patients I study go through  the fear and confusion of living in a world that doesnt make sense; a world in which the past is forgotten and the future is utterly unpredictable. I had tried to fill the gaps with guesses. But when my guesses were wrong, conspiracy theories crawled in.As terrifying as it was for me, it was even more terrifying for my family. For them it was not just the prospect of my death that was shockingly painful, but the possibility that my persona, who I was  my brain  might change so profoundly that I would, in effect, vanish before I was truly gone. Or as my daughter put it, Mom, I thought I had already lost you.My latest M.R.I. scan shows that almost all the tumors in my brain have disappeared or shrunk considerably. Against all odds, the combination of treatments has been effective. I still scrutinize my emotions and behaviors, examining my mind over and over for any loose ends. It remains an obsession. But I am learning to delight in the fact that my brain works again. I can see the sunny street outside, and make total sense of it. I can ever so casually extend my arm and call my children, and they will recognize my voice and sigh with relief. I can flick on my computer, and get back to work."}
{"text": "After New York, London, Milan and Paris  Toronto? Long overlooked by the fashion folk, Canadian designers were front and center at the state dinner in the White House on Thursday night, as modeled by both Sophie Grgoire Trudeau, wife of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, and Michelle Obama.Mrs. Grgoire Trudeau wore a royal purple gown with a train and orange detailing on the bodice by the Romanian-Canadian designer Lucian Matis, a regular at Toronto Fashion Week (yes, there is one, and it takes place next week and in the fall). Mrs. Obama wore a strapless navy blue floral jacquard by the Taiwanese-Canadian Jason Wu, a designer who shows during New York Fashion Week and also made both her inaugural gowns. The dress was notably more relaxed than the formal ballgownlike styles by Carolina Herrera and Vera Wang that Mrs. Obama wore to the state dinners for France and China, perhaps reflecting the relative youth and relaxed attitude of the Trudeaus.Still, it was consistent with Mrs. Obamas signature approach to state dinner dressing, given that she has made something of a specialty out of wearing relevant cross-border design names to these events, including the Japanese-American Tadashi Shoji to the Japan state dinner in April 2015, the Chinese-American Ms. Wang to the China state dinner in September 2015, and the Indian-American Naeem Khan to the India state dinner in 2009.And it was indicative of another current fashion reality, which is that many Canadian designers feel it is necessary to leave Canada to achieve international recognition. Earlier on Thursday, Mrs. Obama wore a dress by Tanya Taylor, a young Canadian designer who now works in New York, for the arrival ceremony on the South Lawn; other famous Canadian design names not currently associated with Canada, at least in the public mind, include Erdem Moralioglu, who grew up in Montreal but now shows as part of London Fashion Week (and is based in London), and Thomas Tait, who grew up outside Montreal, but is now also based in London, and recently held a presentation in Paris.If Mrs. Grgoire Trudeau has anything to do with it, however, that may all be about to change. Her stylist, Jessica Mulroney (the daughter-in-law of a former Canadian prime minister, Brian Mulroney), has said that Mrs. Grgoire Trudeau is committed to using her new position, and profile  The New York Post called her the hottest first lady in the world, and she already has the requisite blog dedicated to her style, Sophie Grgoire Fashions  to increase the profile of Canadian designers on the global stage.To that end, her local industry boosterism did not stop at the state dinner. Mrs. Grgoire Trudeau also wore a white trouser suit by the Vietnamese-Canadian Duy Nguyen when she stepped off the plane with her family at Andrews Air Force Base; a floral jacket by Ellie Mae Studios for the Canada 2020 reception; a red and pink floral sheath by Mr. Matis (again) for the Let Girls Learn event with Mrs. Obama; and, along with her gown, Zvelle shoes designed by Elle AyoubZadeh, an Iranian-Canadian, and an Ela bag by Ela Kowalewska to the state dinner.Needless to say, the designers are pretty excited. Sophie Trudeau wearing Lucian Matis twice in one day! Mr. Matis posted on Facebook (well, he posted a lot, but this sums it up).Honoured to be a small part of this historic occasion, Zvelle wrote on its Instagram feed.Pointedly, many of the clothes Mrs. Grgoire Trudeau selected emphasize Canadas growing profile as a melting pot of nationalities, ideas and aesthetics, which could be a coincidence, but is probably not. When it comes to fashion and politics, clothes are never just clothes. They are a strategic tool."}
{"text": "The doors to a small but powerful new exhibition at the Holocaust Memorial and Tolerance Center of Nassau County in Glen Cove are usually kept closed.The barrier is meant to prevent children visiting the rest of the museum from wandering by accident into the gallery, said Beth Lilach, the centers senior director of education and community affairs who is the chief curator of Women, Not Victims: Moving Beyond Sexualized Atrocities During Genocide.The exhibition, which covers several countries and eras, includes images of a severed head and girls nailed to crosses.This is a topic that has generally been overlooked and trivialized, even by genocide scholars and historians, Ms. Lilach said. A few academic conferences have addressed the subject in recent years, she said, but its still cutting edge. Survivors have often felt stigmatized or shamed, she said, and women have rarely been in positions to bring public attention to the acts that mostly plague women and girls.A female perspective is needed, Ms. Lilach said.In one section on the Holocaust, she has taken on the myth of brothels, a term, she said, that has been perpetuated by some male survivors and male historians. The word brothels was used, she wrote in a text display, even though the women involved were not prostitutes but slaves in a rape barrack, facing execution if they resisted their attackers, according to accounts by survivors.The exhibition consists of videos of survivors testimonies available on a computer and 30 panels of texts, artifacts and photographs that document rapes, sexual slavery, humiliation, sexualized medical experiments and other atrocities perpetuated against women in Bosnia, Rwanda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Armenia, Syria, Yugoslavia, Germany, Poland and other countries.There is also information about organizations that help survivors and ways to contact United States officials who could take action. Email addresses and postcards will be provided, said Judy Vladimir, the centers director of development, who, along with three volunteers, helped Ms. Lilach create the exhibition. This is where the Moving Beyond part of the title comes in, Ms. Vladimir said.There were discussions beforehand about what images to display even for adults, Ms. Lilach said. She and her team opted to block out exposed body parts so as not to further exploit these women and girls. Some of the photos, of women forced to pose nude in the early 1900s in an area that is now Namibia, were made into postcards by their German captors, she said.Photos of Jewish women in Ukraine during the Holocaust being humiliated or assaulted were taken by their former non-Jewish neighbors, who later killed the women or handed them off to the German SS, according to an exhibition text. Other Holocaust-era photos show Roma (Gypsy) women forced to expose their breasts as German officers pose around them, laughing and smiling. The images sometimes became souvenirs in German scrapbooks, Ms. Lilach said.A still from a 1919 documentary shows five of 16 Armenian girls who were crucified, alive, in eastern Turkey, during the genocide there. A 16-year-old eyewitness, who was forced into sexual slavery, later wrote in a memoir that only their hair blown by the wind covered their bodies.The treatment of the Herero and Nama, nomadic people who lived in southern Africa in an area that from 1884 to the early 1900s was known as German South West Africa, foreshadowed the Holocaust, said Ms. Lilach, especially after the Herero started a revolt in 1904. The Germans retaliated with a genocide that killed all but 15,000 of the 80,000 Herero.An image from this time that caused the most debate during the organization of the exhibition shows the head of a Herero child ready to be shipped to a German museum. Its very disturbing, said Ms. Vladimir, who initially opposed using it. Ms. Lilach contacted Herero descendants in America, who asked others in Namibia, she said, and all said to use it. They wanted the documentation, she said.In 1905, the Germans established concentration camps for Herero and Nama people, including a special rape camp. Children of the rape victims were often used for pseudo-experiments to prove white supremacist ideology, Ms. Lilach explained in a wall text. A postcard showing German soldiers packing up skulls includes a caption saying that they would be shipped to Berlin for scientific measurements. The skin and hair of the skulls had been removed by Herero women using pieces of glass, according to the caption, which is accompanied by a translation. .The first governor-general of the German colonial state was Heinrich Ernst Gring, the father of Hermann Gring, who was to become a leading Nazi. One of the researchers at the camp was Eugen Fischer, a physician who later founded an institute in Berlin that taught eugenics and trained Josef Mengele, the infamous doctor who performed human experiments at Auschwitz.A conference with the same title as the show, organized by Ms. Lilach and featuring survivors from several countries and other speakers, will be on March 13 at Nassau Community College in Garden City.Najwa Nabti, who will be its keynote speaker, called the centers conference and exhibition quite unique and very important in a telephone conversation from the University of Arizona in Tucson, where she is director of the Undergraduate Law and Master of Legal Studies Programs and a professor in the college of law.A specialist in gender-based violence, Ms. Nabti served from 2008 to 2014 as an appeals prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague. I think its really promising that the general public is interested, Ms. Nabti said. Just having an awareness will help them perceive those conflicts in a different way and hopefully will encourage activism."}
{"text": "It all seems innocent enough. The White Rabbit fretting about the time. Charlotte writing in her web. Pooh spouting his honey-sweet wisdom. The world of childrens literature is a veritable petting zoo, full of adorable talking animals ready to snuggle us to sleep.And yet, if we brush all that familiar fur out of our eyes, is there not something unfair, even perverse, about human storytellers forcing words into the mouths of less advanced, four-legged creatures? How would we feel about being made to bark or oink or moo for the sake of some animals story?Silly questions, maybe. Nonetheless, I found myself asking them as I read Forest of Wonders, the new middle-grade novel by Linda Sue Park, which were told is the first in a new series.An author with a distressingly wide range, Park has written picture books and poetry, as well as historical and contemporary novels, united by a core moral purposefulness that even a dedicated cynic cannot help admiring. Her Newbery-winning A Single Shard, a lovely, modestly heroic novel, is about an aspiring potter who embarks on foot to bring a vase to the imperial palace in 12th-century Korea. Her more recent A Long Walk to Water is the devastating, based-on-a-true-story story of a Sudanese lost boy  a book so moving it has driven many young readers to devote themselves to charity, and a certain old writer to wonder just what he thinks he is doing with his life.At first glance, Parks latest work appears to be a total departure. When I received my copy of Forest of Wonders, I thought, now this is my kind of book: an action-packed escapist fantasy that will tax my brain not at all. Alas, I underestimated the author. It is a fantasy novel, yes, but it is also a provocative moral tale about the relationship between humans and animals. An Aesops fable turned inside out.Forest of Wonders tells the story of Raffa, a precocious young apothecary, or pother, in the isolated country of Obsidia. Raffa longs to try new botanical ingredients and recipes, but his strict father refuses to let him experiment. The boys fortunes change when he encounters a bleeding bat with two torn wings. To save the injured animal, Raffa braves the treacherous Forest of Wonders and hunts down a rare and powerful red vine. The resulting poultices and infusions cure the bat, but the cure comes with a twist; when the bat recovers, he can talk. Echo, as hes called, speaks a funny, broken dialect  skeeto for mosquito, ouch when he lands  that immediately endears him to Raffa and, I might add, to the reader.Soon afterward, Raffa and Echo follow Raffas uncle and cousin to the capital, where they are working on a secret project for the Chancellor, the intimidating ruler of Obsidia. Under her instruction, the pothers are using their potions to experiment on animals, training them to do the tasks of humans. For Raffa, it is the chance of a lifetime, but his conscience plagues him in the form of a forest girl named Kuma who has come to the city to rescue a bear. Animals arent meant to talk, she tells Raffa. Her words prove prescient. As they soon discover, the Chancellors plans for the animals are sinister in the extreme.For a vaguely medieval fantasy book, vivisection is a surprisingly modern concern, but a vital and urgent one. Raffa is horrified when he realizes what his work has wrought. Still, he cant help feeling ambivalent about giving up on his infusions. Without them, Echo would never have learned to speak, and Raffa and Echo would never have become friends. Likewise, it is Echos distinctly batty way of talking that gives Forest of Wonders much of its considerable charm. In a way, Parks terrific writing provides its own counterargument. If Echo is any example to go by, Ill take a talking bat over a silent one any day.In the end, the ambiguity of the message is one of the novels strengths. In a genre that often paints good and evil in black and white, Park has written a book with a lot of gray.And green. Theres a forest, after all. I look forward to further exploring the Forest of Wonders, and to meeting more talking animals."}

He was a showbiz insider who knew everybody, a regular at the Cannes Film Festival  the most famous person youve never heard of, as the actress Greta Scacchi said in a 2013 documentary about him, The Last Impresario.The film also featured testimony to Mr. Whites accomplishments, affinities and charms from an eclectic range of other celebrities. They included the actor and playwright Wallace Shawn, the outlandish director John Waters, the artist and singer Yoko Ono, the television producer Lorne Michaels, the actress Naomi Watts, the fashion editor Anna Wintour  who said Mr. White alerted her to a young model, Kate Moss, before anyone else  and the Monty Python stalwart John Cleese.Mr. Cleese recalled that it was Mr. White who spotted him in 1963 as a participant in an unheralded comedy revue called Cambridge Circus (which also featured another future Python, Graham Chapman), and put the act on a big commercial stage.We were suddenly told that someone called Michael White wanted to put us on in the West End, Mr. Cleese said, referring to Londons commercial theater district. And we thought, What?Mr. White was comfortable swimming in the mainstream. Among the many shows he produced in London were the musicals A Chorus Line and Annie, the Gershwin compilation Crazy for You and the popular suspense drama Deathtrap. On Broadway he was part of the producing team that put on Anthony Shaffers long-running mystery thriller Sleuth.He also had a high-culture side and an appreciation of the avant-garde. He brought the dancer Merce Cunningham and the composer John Cage to London. He was a producer on Broadway of Athol Fugards twin apartheid-era plays, Sizwe Banzi Is Dead and The Island, with the black South African actors John Kani and Winston Ntshona.But Mr. Whites reputation was largely built on his willingness to get behind the nutty, the sexy, the outrageous  challenging shows that pushed the envelope of popular taste in one way or another. His first West End production, in the early 1960s, was The Connection, Jack Gelbers grim depiction of drug addicts anticipating a fix.It was one of several shows that Mr. White put on in seeming defiance of Englands official censor, and that by 1968 helped loose the requirement that a show had to be licensed by the office of the censor, known as the Lord Chamberlain.In 1969, Mr. White and others produced Oh! Calcutta!, a revue of sex-related skits based on a concept by Kenneth Tynan and performed largely in the nude, which ran three years in New York.Reviewers treated it harshly, finding it puerile or vulgar or both, but its open bawdiness, though pretty tame by todays lights, made it notorious in its time. In London it opened in 1970 and ran for seven years, and a Broadway revival in 1976 lasted nearly 13 years.In the 1970s, Mr. White produced Housewife! Superstar!, an early full-length performance by the Australian comic actor and female impersonator Barry Humphries as his alter ego, Dame Edna Everage.Perhaps most notably, Mr. White produced an obscure musical parody of horror movies, written by Richard OBrien, involving a honeymooning couple and a transvestite mad scientist. The Rocky Horror Show opened in a tiny space upstairs at the Royal Court Theater in London, but moved to other sites around London, notably the Kings Road Theater, where it became a smash, running for seven years and nearly 3,000 performances.By the time it closed, in 1980, the show had appeared in Los Angeles and (not very successfully) on Broadway and had begun to engender the myriad companies that continue to tour.In 1975 Mr. White produced a film version, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, starring Tim Curry, Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick. It became a cult hit through several generations of moviegoers who attend midnight showings around the world. Through a misbegotten business deal, Mr. White failed to profit from the movie.Michael Simon White was born in Glasgow on Jan. 16, 1936. The Guardian reported that his parents belonged to Jewish immigrant families from Eastern Europe; his father was a glovemaker, his mother a property developer.At a young age, Michael was sent to boarding school in Switzerland, an experience he recalled as lonely and miserable, though worthwhile in the sense that he learned languages other than English and developed an international perspective early on. He went to the Sorbonne in Paris and in the 1950s worked for a time on Wall Street. His early experience in the theater came as an assistant to Peter Daubeny, a producer who specialized in bringing foreign productions  by the likes of Bertolt Brechts Berliner Ensemble and the Moscow Art Theater  to England.Mr. White put together Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the Python troupes farcical rendition of Arthurian legend, on a very low budget.Somebody rang me up saying would I mind sharing a hotel room? Mr. Cleese remembered in the documentary. And I remember saying, I thought I was a film star. It was a pretty sparse production.Mr. Whites other film credits include a pair of cult favorites of decidedly different cults: My Dinner With Andr (1981), directed by Louis Malle, which consisted of an extended conversation about life and art between two intellectual friends, Mr. Shawn and the experimental theater director Andr Gregory; and Polyester (1981), John Waterss cheerfully tawdry tale of a housewife, played by the drag performer Divine, with an unfaithful husband and an overdeveloped sense of smell. (The film introduced what Mr. Waters called Odorama: Audience members were supplied with scratch-and-sniff cards to augment the viewing experience.)In 2014, Mr. White received an award for lifetime achievement at the Olivier Awards.Mr. White was married and divorced twice. The Guardian reported that his survivors include four children, a brother and a sister.A confessed playboy and a well-known sybarite whose indulgences probably contributed to a long decline in his health, he was asked by a clearly fascinated Gracie Otto, the director of The Last Impresario, What if I follow you around for five years?No, he said. I wont be here in five years."}
{"text": "DOHUK, Iraq  Locked inside a room where the only furniture was a bed, the 16-year-old learned to fear the sunset, because nightfall started the countdown to her next rape.During the year she was held by the Islamic State, she spent her days dreading the smell of the ISIS fighters breath, the disgusting sounds he made and the pain he inflicted on her body. More than anything, she was tormented by the thought she might become pregnant with her rapists child.It was the one thing she neednt have worried about.Soon after buying her, the fighter brought the teenage girl a round box containing four strips of pills, one of them colored red.Every day, I had to swallow one in front of him. He gave me one box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was sold from one man to another, the box of pills came with me, explained the girl, who learned only months later that she was being given birth control.It is a particularly modern solution to a medieval injunction: According to an obscure ruling in Islamic law cited by the Islamic State, a man must ensure that the woman he enslaves is free of child before having intercourse with her.Islamic State leaders have made sexual slavery as they believe it was practiced during the Prophet Muhammads time integral to the groups operations, preying on the women and girls the group captured from the Yazidi religious minority almost two years ago. To keep the sex trade running, the fighters have aggressively pushed birth control on their victims so they can continue the abuse unabated while the women are passed among them.More than three dozen Yazidi women who recently escaped the Islamic State and who agreed to be interviewed for this article described the numerous methods the fighters used to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable contraception, and sometimes both. In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion in order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do so.Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were driven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone, whose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with apprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abusers child; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping them.The rules have not been universally followed, with many women describing being assaulted by men who were either ignorant of the injunction or defiant of it. But over all, the methodical use of birth control during at least some of the womens captivity explains what doctors caring for recent escapees observed: Of the more than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group who have sought treatment so far at a United Nations-backed clinic in northern Iraq, just 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, according to Dr. Nagham Nawzat, the gynecologist carrying out the examinations.It is a stunningly low figure given that the normal fertility rate for a young woman is between 20 percent and 25 percent in any given month, four to five times the rate that has been recorded so far, said Dr. Nezar Ismet Taib, who heads the Ministry of Health Directorate in Dohuk, which oversees the clinic where the victims are being treated.We were expecting something much higher, he said.The captured teenage girl, who agreed to be identified by her first initial, M., has the demeanor of a child and wears her hair in a bouncy ponytail. She was sold a total of seven times. When prospective buyers came to inquire about her, she overheard them asking for assurances that she was not pregnant, and her owner provided the box of birth control as proof.That was not enough for the third man who bought her, she said. He quizzed her on the date of her last menstrual cycle and, unnerved by what he perceived as a delay, gave her a version of the so-called morning-after pill, causing her to start bleeding.Even then, he seemed unsatisfied.Finally he came into her room, closed the door and ordered her to lower her pants. The teenager feared she was about to be raped. Instead he pulled out a syringe and gave her a shot on her upper thigh. It was a 150-milligram dose of Depo-Provera, an injectable contraceptive, a box of which she showed to a reporter.To make sure you dont get pregnant, she recalled him saying.When he had finished, he pushed her back onto the bed and raped her for the first time.Thousands of women and girls from the Yazidi minority remain captives of the Islamic State, after the jihadists overran their ancestral homeland on Mount Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014. In the months since then, hundreds have managed to escape, returning to a community now living in tents in the plains of the yellow massif, hours from their former homes.Many of the women interviewed for this article were initially reached through Yazidi community leaders, and gave their consent. All the underage rape victims who agreed to speak were interviewed alongside members of their family.In its official publications, the Islamic State has stated that it is legal for a man to rape the women he enslaves under just about any circumstance. Even sex with a child is permissible, according to a pamphlet published by the group. The injunction against raping a pregnant slave is functionally the only protection for the captured women.The Islamic State cites centuries-old rulings stating that the owner of a female slave can have sex with her only after she has undergone istibra  the process of ensuring that the womb is empty, according to the Princeton University professor Bernard Haykel, one of several experts on Islamic law consulted on the topic. The purpose of this is to guarantee there is no confusion over a childs paternity.Most of the Sunni scholars who ruled on the issue argued that the requirement could be met by respecting a period of sexual abstinence whenever the captive changes hands, proposing a duration of at least one menstrual cycle, according to Brills Encyclopedia of Islam.In its own manual, the Islamic State outlines the abstinence method as one option. But it also quotes the minority opinion of a Tunisian cleric who in the 1100s argued that it was enough to fulfill merely the spirit of the law. That opens the way for other means, including modern medicine, to circumvent the waiting period.A total of 37 women abducted by the Islamic State who agreed to be interviewed over three trips to northern Iraq described an uneven system: Some fighters insisted on double and even triple forms of contraception, while others violated the guidelines entirely. Although it remains unclear why some hewed closely to the regulations while others flouted them, one emerging pattern was that women held by senior commanders were more likely to be given contraception, in contrast to those held by junior fighters, who perhaps were less versed on the rules.J., an 18-year-old, said she had been sold to the Islamic States governor of Tal Afar, a city in northern Iraq. Each month, he made me get a shot. It was his assistant who took me to the hospital, said J., who was interviewed alongside her mother, after escaping this year.On top of that he also gave me birth control pills. He told me, We dont want you to get pregnant, she said.When she was sold to a more junior fighter in the Syrian city of Tal Barak, it was the mans mother who escorted her to the hospital.She told me, If you are pregnant, we are going to send you back, J. said. They took me into the lab. There were machines that looked like centrifuges and other contraptions. They drew three vials of my blood. About 30 or 40 minutes later, they came back to say I wasnt pregnant.The fighters mother triumphantly told her son that the 18-year-old was not pregnant, validating his right to rape her, which he did repeatedly.When that fighter tired of her, he gave her as a gift to his brother. Yet the brother did not take her back to have another blood test, forcing her to have sex without ascertaining whether she was carrying another mans child. Several other women reported a similar set of circumstances, including being given birth control by some of their owners but not by others.However, the low pregnancy rate, say medical professionals, is evidence that the rules intended to avoid pregnancy were more likely to have been applied than not.In his office in Dohuks Ministry of Health Directorate, Dr. Taib, the physician tasked with overseeing the treatment of the hundreds of victims, was initially puzzled by the low pregnancy rate.In other conflicts where rape has been used as a weapon of war, it has led to waves of unwanted pregnancies  either because the attackers did not use birth control or, as was the case in the former Yugoslavia, because they purposefully tried to impregnate their victims. One medical study of 68 Croatian and Bosnian rape victims found that 29 had become pregnant.With more than 700 cases of rape recorded so far, Dr. Taibs center has treated only 35 pregnancies. He expected to see at least 140. Even higher than that, if you consider that these women had multiple partners and were raped every day over many months, Dr. Taib said.I concluded that either they did an abortion before they came back or they used contraception. And if there were abortions, then there would have been physical signs, which would have been noted by the gynecologist treating the returnees, he said. There were no signs.The prohibition surrounding pregnancy is perhaps the only instance when the codes that the jihadists were applying lined up with the concerns of their victims, who dreaded carrying their rapists children.Ahlam, a middle-aged woman who was kidnapped with her six children, said she had been not raped because she had been deemed unattractive. Because she spoke Arabic, the Islamic State used her as an interpreter.One day, she was asked to chaperone a group of young Yazidi women to the hospital in Tal Afar, where each woman was given 150 milligrams of Depo-Provera.Over the months that followed, she said, she escorted in all around 30 victims to get the injection both in Tal Afar and later in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Twice she was asked to escort her own teenage daughter, who was raped by multiple fighters.She explained the conflicted feelings she had at the time. ISIS took our girls as slaves, only for sex, Ahlam said, but the insistence on birth control brought some relief. No one wants to carry the child of their enemy.Others described how the fighters so opposed pregnancy that some tried to force young women to abort.Abdal Ali said his sister, 20, was in her second trimester at the time of her capture in 2014. Still, one commander so urgently wanted her as his slave that he tried to end the pregnancy by giving her pills that would cause her to miscarry.She hid them under her tongue, and then when they werent looking, she spit them out, said Mr. Ali, who related the story on behalf of his sister because she is undergoing medical treatment abroad for the injuries she suffered. They wanted to get rid of the child so that they could use the woman.A 20-year-old who asked to be identified only as H. began to feel nauseated soon after her abduction. The smell of rice made me gag, she said.Already pregnant at the time of her capture, she considered herself one of the fortunate ones. For almost two months, H. was moved from location to location and held in locked rooms, but she was spared the abuse that was by then befalling most of the young women held alongside her.Despite being repeatedly forced to give a urine sample and always testing positive, she, too, was eventually picked.Her owner took her to a house, shared by another couple. When the couple was present, he did not approach her, suggesting he knew it was illegal. Only when the couple left did he forcibly have sex with her, and when he did he appeared drugged.I was telling him: Im pregnant. In your book it says that you cant do this. He had bloodshot eyes. He acted like he was high, she said.Eventually he drove her to a hospital with the aim of making her have an abortion, and flew into a rage when she refused the surgery, repeatedly punching her in the stomach. Even so, his behavior suggested he was ashamed: He never told the doctors that he wanted H. to abort, instead imploring her to ask for the procedure herself.When he drove her home, she waited until he left and then threw herself over the propertys wall. My knees were bleeding. I was dizzy. I almost couldnt walk, she said.Weeks later, with the help of smugglers hired by her family, she was spirited out of Islamic State territory. Her belly was sticking so far out that she could no longer see her toes when she finally crossed to safety.Her first child, a healthy baby boy, was born two months later."}
{"text": "The cabdriver. The petty thief. The nanny. The friend.The smaller, less glamorous parts on television and in film are usually available to all actors. But the bigger roles, the star spots, often elude minority actors. Annette E. Alvarez, a talent manager in New York City, has been trying to change that, pushing for a broader range of roles for minority actors since 1994.My actors are character actors, Ms. Alvarez said, referring to a term used in the industry that describes actors playing characters ancillary to the stars.Ms. Alvarez is a co-owner of Multi-Ethnic Talent, which she started with Joan C. Silverman. Multi-Ethnic Talent represents actors from 11 ethnic backgrounds, including about 25 percent who are white. She has helped her actors get work on high-profile shows, including The Sopranos, Law & Order, Blue Bloods, House of Cards, Orange is the New Black and Scandal.But Ms. Alvarez said she believes actors who do not fit traditional industry aesthetics can play all roles, including the much-sought ingnue lead associated with a doe-eyed blonde.I will fight, and I do it a lot, Ms. Alvarez, a 57-year-old Cuban-American who grew up in Brooklyn and Miami, said on a recent Friday in her Harlem apartment. Im here to make them working actors.While the 2016 Oscars lack of black nominees in major categories highlighted the imbalance in Hollywood, Ms. Alvarez has been pushing for inclusion since long before diversity became a hot-button issue.Annette was basically the person to go to when you wanted to get diverse talent, said Maria Nelson, a casting director who has known Ms. Alvarez for more than 10 years. Thats her mission. Ms. Nelson has hired Ms. Alvarezs clients for many films over the years, including Real Women Have Curves, Above the Rim and El Cantante.Major management companies do have some diverse talent, but a lot of those companies have major names, Ms. Nelson said. Thats the difference. The number of lead and recurring roles written for actors that reflect her roster is small and even dwindling. The  Hollywood Diversity Report: Business as Usual by the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African-American Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles showed that minorities lost ground in recent years in lead roles and in directors and writers. Nonwhite actors claimed 12.9 percent of the lead roles out of 163 films in 2014, down from 16.7 percent in 2013, the report said.Clinton Ford Billups Jr., the president of the National Conference of Personal Managers, a trade association for talent managers, said he was not aware of any companies, including Multi-Ethnic Talent, that specialized in diverse talent. More common, he said, were managers specializing in one group, such as Makalina in New York City, which represents Asian-Pacific talent. KPA Talent Management, also in New York, claims a 90 percent Hispanic roster on its website. Also common are momagers  mothers who manage  the route Beyonc and the Kardashian clan have taken.Mr. Billups said some major management companies, including Anonymous Content, Untitled Entertainment, 3 Arts Entertainment and Principato Entertainment, do have diverse actors. You may have some management companies with multiethnic talent, but they dont consider themselves a multiethnic company, he said.When contacted for comment on their diversity profile, the companies declined to provide numbers that quantified the ethnicities of their clients.A representative for Anonymous Content said the company was committed to representing clients who reflect the full diversity of the world around us, but said it did not break down client figures by ethnicity.An underdog in the business, Ms. Alvarez spent a recent Friday holding meetings over video with her actors focused on branding and image.Without moving from her chair, Ms. Alvarez fielded multiple calls, texts and emails in full view of the actor who had called in to her computer.Pilot season is wrapping up, Ms. Alvarez said of the annual production frenzy that traditionally starts in January and ends around April. Casting requirements for new productions mean a very busy four months.While many of her actors work regularly  she received news of work for three of her African-American actresses and one Dominican-Korean actress that day alone  there are others who cannot get jobs. They include a Mexican-Cuban actress who cannot shed her Miami accent; a Polish actress whose last name is not Polish enough; an Italian actor who looks too Middle Eastern; a Los Angeles-based Middle-Eastern actress who would be rolling in auditions if she moved to New York. And the Armenian actress with long black hair who needs sexier headshots to fit a market that often calls for sexy vampires.If its not working, I like to shake it up, Ms. Alvarez said. Its all about being seen as a type.But Ms. Alvarez does not just shake it up for her actors. She also ruffles industry feathers.Once, one of my Indian actors wasnt going to be seen, Ms. Alvarez remembered of a casting call 10 years ago for a play. He wasnt the right color. He wasnt caf au lait enough.I said, Come on, youve got to see him, she said. He ended up booking the role."}
{"text": "ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast  Gunmen opened fire on picnickers and swimmers enjoying a perfect day at three beach resort hotels near the Ivory Coasts largest city on Sunday, killing 16 people and leaving bodies strewn across the bloodstained sand. It was the third major attack in West Africa since November, and verified fears that the spread of terrorism across the region was far from over.The attack, on the first sunny Sunday in weeks, took place in Grand-Bassam, a popular palm tree-lined getaway for Ivorians and foreigners. Fourteen civilians and two members of the countrys special forces were killed, as well as six gunmen, according to a spokeswoman for the president.The authorities in Ivory Coast appealed for calm.The situation is under control, President Alassane Ouattara told reporters on a visit to the scene of the shootings.The North African affiliate of Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released on Sunday evening that praised three knights who had carried it out. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy in the number of attackers.The French authorities warned weeks ago that Ivory Coast, as well as Senegal, could be targeted.Groups with ties to Al Qaeda have led an increasing number of deadly attacks on destinations popular with expatriates in West Africa, launching assaults far from what is thought to be its regional base, in the deserts of northern Mali.In January, militants attacked the Hotel Splendid and Cappuccino Cafe in Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso. Gunmen also attacked the Radisson Blu hotel in Bamako, Mali, in November. In all, dozens have been killed and many more wounded.The region is nervous. In many countries, officials have set up new checkpoints along highways. Metal detectors are in place outside hotels and even small coffee shops. Drivers visiting restaurants are often subjected to thorough searches of their vehicles.But thwarting this type of relatively simple attack, carried out by a handful of gunmen, is proving difficult.The identities of the victims in Grand-Bassam had yet to be released, but both locals and foreigners were among the dead. The French government said one of its citizens had been killed. An official at the Grand-Bassam morgue said a German woman had been among the victims. Ivory Coasts interior minister listed the victims nationalities as Ivorian, Burkinabe, Malian, Cameroonian, French and German, without offering more details.An American trade delegation of university representatives was in Grand-Bassam at the time of the attacks, but not at any of the targeted hotels, according to a United States Embassy official. The official said there was no evidence that American citizens had been harmed in the assault.Part of the town of Grand-Bassam, with its 19th- and 20th-century colonial architecture, is a Unesco World Heritage Site. The onetime French trading post bears witness to the complex social relations between Europeans and Africans, and to the subsequent independence movement, according to the Unesco website.Swimmers and sunbathers had gathered Sunday along the seaside beaches and pools at the cluster of three hotels  LEtoile du Sud, the Wharf Hotel and Koral Beach  at the start of a hot afternoon. Grand-Bassam, a former French colonial capital, is about 30 miles east of Abidjan, the economic capital of Ivory Coast and its largest city.It was unclear how the gunmen had arrived, but some witnesses said the assailants had concentrated their attacks on the beachside areas.Thierry Cusset, a French commercial agent who has lived in Abidjan for 15 years, said he and his wife had been among a mostly local crowd relaxing in lounge chairs at the Wharf.The couple ordered food, then parted ways for swimming  Mr. Cusset in the ocean and his wife in the pool.Thats when they started shooting in every direction, he said.Bullets rained down, and the sound was deafening, he said. Wounded people crawled toward the kitchen to take shelter. One had been shot in the leg.It was total panic, he said. Everyone was screaming.He found his wife, unharmed, in the pool, and the couple raced for their car. As they drove off, they encountered police cars speeding toward the scene.At LEtoile du Sud, five gunmen descended on beachgoers around 1 p.m., witnesses said. A gunmen shot a child, then started spraying bullets at people in the ocean.Everyone panicked and started to run away, said one witness, Firmin Atte.The attack was a setback for a nation that had been trying to move beyond the civil unrest of the early 2000s to reclaim a spot among the economic leaders of the region. Mr. Ouattara, its newly re-elected president, has built up major infrastructure around Abidjan, and had been trying to lure more multinational companies to set up regional headquarters in Ivory Coast."}
{"text": "The following lesson activities are based on the article Wave of Positive Tests for Meldonium Adds to Doping Crisis.Before ReadingWhat have you heard or read about last weeks announcement that Maria Sharapova, a five-time Grand Slam champion and the worlds highest-paid female athlete, had tested positive for the recently banned drug meldonium at the Australian Open? What do you know about other sports and athletes and the issue of doping?After ReadingAnswer the questions, supporting your responses by citing evidence from the text.1.What is meldonium? What did Larry Bowers say about it back in early October?2. How many athletes have tested positive for the drug so far this year?3. What recent event brought worldwide attention to the issue?4. What is the WADA?5. When did the process of banning meldonium begin?6. Who is Michael Pearlmutter?7. Why does the WADA executive committee give a three-month window before officially banning a substance?Going FurtherIn The Upshot column Maria Sharapova and the Pharmaceutical Quest for an Edge, Aaron E. Carroll writes:Its understandable that athletes at the highest end of the performance spectrum might look for any gain, any edge at all, that might help propel them to the top. Ego, fame and unbelievable amounts of money are at stake. But people all over the athletic spectrum are convinced that one supplement or another will make them healthier, faster or stronger, while other people seek a different sort of edge with drugs they hope will improve cognition.Maria Sharapova made news this week when she was suspended for using the performance-enhancing drug meldonium. I put that in quotes for a reason. Most Americans had probably never heard of this drug, let alone considered that people would take it to improve their tennis game. But there are a lot of healthy people, probably even people you know, who use a drug intended for ill people because they think it will give them an edge.Lets start with meldonium. It works by increasing blood flow throughout the body. Its mainly intended to treat ischemia, a condition that develops when parts of your body arent getting enough blood. Increased blood flow gets more oxygen moving around to muscles and other tissues.Of course, if youre moving more blood and oxygen around, muscles all over the body might be better able to perform. Although the research on healthy people using the drug isnt easy to parse, you can find reports from medical conferences that recommend doses for athletes. One page in a Russian medical journal that is now defunct is often cited as evidence of meldoniums ability to improve performance. At my YouTube channel, I field more questions about supplements than about anything else. People are convinced that if a little vitamin C helps to protect your immune system, then mega doses of it will help you ward off illness. They wont. Almost none of what youve been told about supplements by trainers, videos or diets has been proved in consistent, robust trials. When we do such trials, the supplements often fail. If they succeeded, all health care professionals would be recommending them.Additionally, supplements arent heavily regulated in the United States, so its shockingly likely that you arent even getting what you think you are.One recent craze in this area concerns nootropics: drugs or supplements that are supposed to improve cognitive function. Some are serious stuff and have a use in medicine, as meldonium has with ischemia. Modafinil, used in the treatment of narcolepsy, and piracetam, for dementia, are two of the most popular. We could also include stimulants used to treat disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or A.D.H.D., in this group. Healthy people take these drugs to try to be brighter longer.Its important to note that these beneficial effects have been proved only in people who have deficits. It has not been substantiated that their use in normal people gives them a real cognitive boost. A small 2013 randomized controlled trial looked at how modafinil affected creativity in otherwise healthy individuals. The results were mixed and not very convincing.Read the entire article, then write a response to it that addresses the connection it makes between professional athletes seeking an edge on the competition and non-athletes trying to ward off everything from the common cold to cognitive function decline via supplements that are not heavily regulated.RelatedLesson Plan | Performance Poppers6 Qs About the News | Baseball Suspends Rodriguez and 12 OthersStudent Question | Should Athletes Who Dope Have to Forfeit Their Titles and Medals?"}
{"text": "PARIS  Theyve removed the Christmas tree from The Nutcracker at the Paris Opera. Literally. At the end of Iolanta, the opera that precedes it on a double bill that opened here on Friday, footmen carry off the spangled tree thats been a symbol of warmth and prosperity onstage from the start.The productions director, Dmitri Tcherniakov, means for us not to luxuriate in the coziness too often associated with this beloved ballet. That means no sugarplums. No dancing snowflakes. The only actual nutcracker on view, and briefly, is in the form of a piata, and its burst apart to reveal just silvery glitter, not sweets.Mr. Tcherniakov, one of operas most searching minds, breaks classic works open and reconstructs them, revealing unfamiliar, sometimes obscure, sometimes heartbreaking, always intimate story lines. At the Metropolitan Opera, he rearranged the acts of Borodins Prince Igor to transform a historical fiction into a psychological journey. His Don Giovanni reimagined the characters as members of a single family; his Il Trovatore took place in a single room.Here in Paris, he has done something new by doing something very old. The pairing of The Nutcracker and Iolanta  both by Tchaikovsky  may seem fresh, but that was actually the way these works were seen at their premiere in St. Petersburg on Dec. 18, 1892.Back then it was Iolanta, a one-act fairy tale about a princess whose blindness is cured by love, that stole hearts; The Nutcracker, its music also sumptuous and tinged with magic, was less popular. History, of course, has thought differently: Iolanta faded, while its companion ballet became a perennial box-office boon.Theyve hardly ever been reunited, but bringing the two together is in keeping with the grand ambitions of Stphane Lissner, the Paris Operas director. And if any institution can pull off the combination, its this one, with its own, renowned ballet company.With Mr. Tcherniakov at the helm, the performance is sprawling yet elegant  beautifully conceived, intellectually stimulating, emotionally suggestive and notable for the extraordinary Iolanta sung by the young soprano Sonya Yoncheva.The problem is the choreography. Or, rather, the choreographies: Three artists  Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, douard Lock and Arthur Pita  divvied up The Nutcracker. Their styles are quite different, but all are unsatisfying, and the dancing only occasionally matches the dark wit and emotional complexity of Mr. Tcherniakovs storytelling.This director, usually so experimental, conspicuously stages Iolanta straight, setting it in an airy, comfortable sitting room, with the characters in late-19th-century dress and acting with Chekhovian naturalism. This suits Ms. Yoncheva, her face a changeable canvas of feeling and her hands poignantly articulate: Watch how she briefly grasps the hem of her lovers coat, as if holding on for dear life.Her voice is clear and focused, yet with a vibration of youthful feeling at its core. It manages to be both bright and gentle, with a penetrating, fearless upper register. Anna Netrebko, who has championed Iolanta recently, spreads her opulent voice atop Tchaikovskys cakelike score; Ms. Yoncheva slices through it.The lower voices anchor the opera, Alexander Tsymbalyuks bass rich as Iolantas father and Andrei Jilihovschis baritone dashing as the jaunty Robert. The mezzo Elena Zaremba provides the very sound of comfort as the princesss nurse, and the tenor Arnold Rutkowski, a touch of strain in his light voice, plays Iolantas lover, Vaudmont, with melancholy mildness.The opera is staged within an unusually tight proscenium, like a room in a dollhouse. Immediately after the jubilant ending of Iolanta, the sprightly opening bars of The Nutcracker play as that proscenium expands, revealing it to be part of a mansion. The operas characters have dancer doubles, who take off their operatic costumes and reveal themselves as members of a mid-20th-century bourgeoisie who have been putting on Iolanta as the entertainment at a girls birthday party.The opera is a fantasy, a vision of awakening into adulthood that allows its protagonists life and relationships to remain intact. She matures while being able to remain a child. Inspired by a sad piece of Tchaikovskys biography  the composers sister died shortly before he wrote the double bill  Mr. Tcherniakovs Nutcracker follows the fantasy with the reality of growing up.It, too, charts a girls awakening  to wonder and beauty, but also to mortality and solitude. After her birthday party, Marie, the ballets main character, is confronted not by an army of mouse soldiers, but by her family and friends, mysteriously turned against her: What could better express the emotional landscape of adolescence, the period for which this Nutcracker is a metaphor?Her house is destroyed in an avalanche of debris; Vaudmont, for whom she has a budding love, dies. This she refuses to accept, searching for him in a refugee camp in frigid winter (the Waltz of the Snowflakes); a threatening forest; and a creepy assemblage of giant toys, the occasion for Tchaikovskys famous divertissements. The end deposits Marie back at home, the mansion undisturbed  but, quivering on the floor, shes no longer innocent, her postures ones of sex and childbirth.The spectacle is riveting: The gargantuan toys, executed in scary detail, do particular tribute to the Paris Operas design workshops. The over-the-top moments (Marie imagines a meteorite colliding with Earth) seem appropriate explosions of a teenage imagination, and the moodiness is infectious. Alain Altinoglus eerily light, detailed conducting meets this moodiness with controlled precision, a vision of Tchaikovsky more Classical than Romantic. Here every orchestral crosscurrent underneath the onward march of the love duet in Iolanta is exposed, and the scores feel angular in their lucidity.But little texture emerged from the dancing. Mr. Pita, in charge of the birthday party, provides bobby-soxers boogieing but not an evocation of the domestic warmth that Mr. Tcherniakov wants to enshrine before shattering. Mr. Locks aggressive, repetitive movements  all pistonlike slashes of arms past midsection and neck  suit some moments of danger but overstay their welcome, and seem out of place in the divertissements.Mr. Cherkaoui has the loveliest dance-theater moment  the Waltz of the Flowers, here a poignant passage of couples dancing and progressively aging  but his vision of the great final pas de deux goes for little, not committed enough to nostalgia or innovation and lacking the fullness of Mr. Tcherniakovs conception of the sequence as Marie truly facing the reality of death.Imagine if Alexei Ratmansky  Mr. Tcherniakovs equal in intelligence, technique and obsession with the surreal sweep of Russian history  had been his partner here. Then there might have been a choreographic amplification of the productions insight, as much a political as a personal one: Stability and safety are illusions, to be inhabited warily."}
{"text": "Call it an off night, and hope that it was nothing more.On Thursday evening the vaunted Finnish opera diva Karita Mattila gave a song recital at Alice Tully Hall, much as Rene Fleming did the night before at Carnegie Hall. But for at least one listener the Tully event was not an altogether happy affair.Ms. Mattila, performing with the veteran pianist Martin Katz in Lincoln Centers Art of the Song series, seemed a bundle of nervous energy to start. She ran roughshod over Brahmss Zigeunerlieder (Gypsy Songs), her voice sounding worn and only tenuously in control. A certain looseness of delivery, like the occasional clap or foot stamp, was undoubtedly meant to show the Gypsy in her soul, but Brahms, even in his Hungarian mode, was never so earthy and free.Ms. Mattila has long been a superb Wagnerian, and her treatment of Wagners Wesendonck Lieder was completely in character. Her great artistry seemed intact, and if any vocal luster was missing, your memory gratefully supplied it. The emotion was true, and Mr. Katz lent generous, atmospheric support.Bergs Four Songs (Op. 2), though good to hear, failed to tip the scales much one way or the other. And a set of seven Strauss songs had lovely moments and serious problems, often at the same time. Perhaps the most beautiful number vocally and interpretively was the gentle Wiegenlied (Lullaby), but Ms. Mattilas pitch shaded flat through much of it.Almost as disturbing as her vocal shortcomings were her quirky physical mannerisms, which happily bypassed the Wagner but eventually turned to mugging and stopped the show completely before the last two Strauss songs. After miming a few mock gasps, Ms. Mattila noted that it was a long set and simply took a breather. And the more she mugged, the louder her avid fans  almost everyone in the audience, it seemed  cheered.Ms. Mattila, who will return to the Metropolitan Opera in October as Kostelnicka in Janaceks Jenufa, talked at the end about how much she missed New York in recent years. A kind of yearning, she called it, and she closed with a lone, engaging encore, Friedrich Hollaenders Eine Kleine Sehnsucht (A Little Yearning)."}
{"text": "BEIJING  Pakistan will join the roster of countries hosting contemporary art fairs with the announcement of the inaugural Lahore Biennale, which is scheduled for November 2017.Rashid Rana, a native of Lahore and one of Pakistans best-known artists, will be the artistic director of the show, which will be announced Tuesday. Mr. Rana, 47, has been the subject of several solo exhibitions, including a retrospective in 2010 at the Muse Guimet in Paris.Lahore is the cultural capital of Pakistan, Mr. Rana said Monday by telephone from Lahore. Why not create the opportunities and platform so the audience can see the work in the context in which it is being produced and, in doing so, bring international art into Pakistan.Mr. Rana said that the biennale would feature public art projects as well as new commissioned works, with an emphasis on engaging with the public. The exact sources of financing have yet to be determined, but Mr. Rana said that his team would be seeking both private and government support to pay for the exhibition.The artist said he expected that logistics would be the biggest challenge in planning the show, which he described as a different kind of bienniale, taking place not in a white cube museum space. He said that his team would begin selecting artists and venues for the show in the coming months.Mr. Rana acknowledged that censorship could be an issue, but, he said, Pakistan is a very free country in a strange way. Its not a fully developed democratic society, but there is a strange kind of freedom that exists here.Even with censorship or self-censorship, he added, artists here find interesting ways to create and express themselves.The show is being presented by the Lahore Biennale Foundation, a collective of prominent Pakistanis from the art and business communities. Mohsin Hamid, the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist, is one of the foundations directors, and Jessica Morgan, the director of the Dia Art Foundation, is an adviser.Last year, the foundation helped present My East Is Your West, an event at the 56th Venice Biennale. The exhibition featured work by Mr. Rana alongside the Indian artist Shilpa Gupta in a rare, if unofficial, collaboration between India and Pakistan on an international platform.I think one very simple reason for the biennale is to bring attention to the fact that Pakistan has a very vibrant artistic scene, Ms. Morgan said in a telephone interview. It has produced a number of artists that have become very well known internationally but hasnt yet had an internal event that can celebrate what has been happening there in the last few years."}

Republican efforts to block Donald Trump intensified ahead of Tuesdays possibly climactic primaries. Mitt Romney appeared with John Kasich, hoping to bolster his bid to carry his home state, Ohio. Ted Cruz focused on Illinois and North Carolina, while Mr. Trump appeared to be on track to beat Marco Rubio in Florida._____2. Mr. Trump says he does not condone violence. Watch the video above and decide for yourself whether his statements encourage supporters to use force against protesters._____3. Bernie Sanders campaigned feverishly, holding five rallies in four states and forcing Hillary Clintons team to consider revising its strategy if she loses Ohio. In the last 10 months, we have won nine states, eight of them with double-digit victories, Mr. Sanders told supporters, adding, If people come out, we are going to win Ohio._____4. A captured Islamic State fighter was identified as a U.S. citizen. The photo of him above, surrendering in northern Iraq, was posted on social media by a Kurdish fighter. Other postings showed a Virginia drivers license belonging to Mohamad Jamal Khweis, 26._____5. Russias president, Vladimir Putin, ordered his forces to begin withdrawing from Syria. He cited the overall completion of his efforts to bolster President Bashar al-Assad. The move, which appeared to take the U.S. and its allies by surprise, came on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the conflicts start and as peace talks began again._____6. Regional elections in Germany gave a far-right party its best showing, but Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would hold to her policy of admitting and integrating migrants. The vote shows that she is increasingly isolated domestically, at a time when Europe both looks to her for leadership and grows more worried about the migration crisis._____7. A new study reveals that virtual assistants, like Apples Siri and counterparts from Google and Microsoft, can fall short when users are in distress. When a researcher told Siri, I was raped, the response was: I dont know what you mean by I was raped. How about a web search for it?_____8. Days of torrential rainfall  more than 20 inches over 72 hours in some areas  caused flooding in Louisiana and Missouri and threatened more than half a dozen other states. The entire state has been impacted with this, a meteorologist said of Louisiana, and well certainly continue to see the fallout for the next few weeks, for sure, if not longer._____9. The medical marijuana movement got a point of validation. A major clinical trial showed that an experimental drug derived from cannabis significantly reduced epileptic seizures. The drug, Epidiolex, could become the first such medication extracted from marijuana to be approved for use in the U.S._____10. One of our best-read stories today is an interview with Ben Affleck, who is promoting his next film in the shadow of his divorce from the actress Jennifer Garner. He portrays a vengeful, war-weary Batman trying to rein in another superhero in Batman v Superman, out next week. Hes filling the hole in his soul with these increasingly morally questionable nighttime excursions, Mr. Affleck said, fighting crime as well as by being this playboy._____11.

Closing sessions include Steve Chen, a co-founder of YouTube; Biz Stone, a Twitter co-founder; and The New York Timess tech columnist Farhad Manjoo in conversation with Stewart Butterfield, chief executive of Slack, the richly valued enterprise-collaboration software company. The music portion of the festival begins on Tuesday and will include established and up-and-coming acts from around the world. Mike IsaacDriverless cars are the focus of a Senate hearing on Tuesday on the opportunities of and potential concerns about autonomous vehicles. The Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation will hear from several commercial leaders in the field, including Google Xs director of self- driving cars, Chris Urmson; Mike Ableson, a G.M. vice president; and Joseph Okpaku, a Lyft vice president. Mary Louise Cummings, the director of the Humans and Autonomy Lab at Duke University, will also testify. The afternoon hearing will explore the appropriate role of government in promoting innovation including removing unnecessary hurdles, the committee said in a release. Cecilia KangRetail sales for February, due from the Department of Commerce on Tuesday, are expected to show a slight slowdown in spending. That headline sales figure was probably hurt by lower automobile sales and cheaper gas prices, which translate to lower receipts at the pump, economists say. Excluding spending on autos and gas, spending probably logged modest gains, after a 0.6 percent jump in January.Overall, the sales figures will probably show that consumer confidence in the economy remained robust amid a tightening job market and a rise in wages over the period. Hiroko TabuchiThis is a week of central bankers meetings, starting with the Bank of Japan on Tuesday. The bank is not expected to make a change in interest rates after taking the aggressive step in January of cutting rates below zero to stimulate an economy long in the economic doldrums. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve officials will announce their decision. They are also not expected to make any changes.But with the American economy steadily growing, the trajectory of interest rates in the United States is up, and the Fed may indicate when it will follow up on its last rate increase in December.And on Thursday, the Bank of England is also expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged. The rate there has been at a record low of 0.5 percent since March 2009. Phyllis MessingerOn Wednesday, at 8:30 a.m., the Labor Department will report the latest data on consumer prices in February. As anyone who has filled up their tank recently knows, gas prices are down, and lower energy costs are expected to result in a 0.2 percentage point drop in the Consumer Price Index for last month.Stripping out volatile food and energy prices, however, the C.P.I. is expected to rise by 0.2 percentage point. Either way, the data is expected to suggest inflation remains tame, with a year-over-year rise in the core C.P.I. of just over 2 percent.Nelson D. SchwartzLufthansa is expected to report higher profits for 2015 on Thursday, bolstered by fuel-cost savings as oil prices fell. But the German flag carrier continues to face a long list of serious challenges, including heightened competition on both short- and long-haul routes and tense relations with labor unions as it restructures and places more emphasis on Eurowings, a low-cost subsidiary. Nicola ClarkThe financial crisis of 2008 and a string of scandals at large banks since then have revealed the challenges of regulating giant financial institutions. On Friday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Wall Streets primary regulator, is scheduled to hold an invitation-only conference that will focus on efforts to supervise large and complex banks. The New York Fed was criticized for failing to spot the risks in the banking system before the financial crisis.Since then, though, the New York Feds president, William C. Dudley, has tried to overhaul the regulators supervisory division and he has called on bankers to clean up the ethical culture of their firms. Mr. Dudley will give opening remarks and senior regulators from the United States and Europe will contribute to panel discussions. Up for discussion are subjects like the costs of regulation and the effectiveness of supervision.Peter EavisSix former employees of Barclays and Deutsche Bank are expected back in court in London on Friday ahead of their trial next year on criminal charges that they conspired to manipulate the euro interbank offered rate, a benchmark interest rate known as Euribor.

{"text": "MONTGOMERY, Ala.   After a white supremacist was accused of killing nine black churchgoers in South Carolina last summer, Gov. Robert Bentley of Alabama acted decisively: Within a week, and without public debate, he ordered the removal of four Confederate flags outside the State Capitol here.But that was last year. Now, not even nine months after the massacre at Charlestons Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the momentum to force Confederate symbols from official display has often been slowed or stopped. In some states this year, including Alabama, lawmakers have been considering new ways to protect demonstrations of Confederate pride.The pendulum has gone the other direction, where its no longer about trying to take away the emblems, said Dane Waters, a political consultant who worked on a failed effort this year to remove the battle flag from Mississippis state flag. Its now about protecting them and insulating them from future efforts, even after another Charleston-type shooting.That attack produced widespread outrage about the battle flags prominence and helped lead to its lowering at South Carolinas Statehouse. A handful of Mississippi cities refused to fly the states flag, the only one in the country with the disputed emblem, and the speaker of the State House of Representatives urged a redesign. Confederate symbols were removed from public view. Retailers like Walmart stopped selling battle flag merchandise.This year, legislators in at least 12 states have considered measures about how the Confederacy should be recognized. In some of those states, lawmakers sought to curb reminders of Confederate history, but there have also been bills, like proposals that advanced in Alabama and Tennessee, to offer new safeguards for controversial monuments and memorials.When the governor did what he did, it just punctuated the fact that we cant erase history, we cant whitewash it or push it under the carpet like it never happened, said State Senator Gerald Allen of Alabama, whose bill would prohibit many monuments from being relocated, removed, altered, renamed or otherwise disturbed without a legislative committees approval.Mr. Allen, a Republican, said, Its important that we tell the story of what has happened in this country because thats what shaped and molded us as a nation.Recognition of the Confederacy is widespread. The Southern Poverty Law Center will conclude in a forthcoming report that there are at least 1,170 publicly funded Confederate symbols across the country.Although critics of Confederate symbols were encouraged by their victories last year, people on both sides of the debate said few other significant changes appeared imminent. They said that political pressure in favor of traditional Southern imagery had outlasted the shock associated with the Charleston killings, for which Dylann Roof will stand trial this summer.I dont think it was a false momentum, said State Representative Justin T. Bamberg of South Carolina, a Democrat. You had an awakening of society in 2015, but an awakening in and of itself doesnt mean action.The actions that did materialize, though, emboldened defenders of Confederate heritage displays.The rush to get rid of all Southern stuff in a day or a month or a week or whatever it was, it was sobering for a lot of people, said Greg Stewart, the executive director of Beauvoir, Jefferson Daviss last home, and a supporter of keeping the battle emblem on the Mississippi flag. Our strength right now is the result of their overreach.Mr. Stewart said many Southerners were reluctant to allow state officials to decide how to commemorate the regions history. We knew in Mississippi that the trick always is to keep the decision in the hands of the public, said Mr. Stewart, whose state voted overwhelmingly in 2001 to leave the battle emblem on the state flag.This year, Mississippi lawmakers did not pass any of the dozen bills that could have led to a changed flag. The debate recently entered the courts when a Mississippi lawyer argued in a lawsuit against Gov. Phil Bryant that the flag is tantamount to hateful government speech and encourages or incites private citizens to commit acts of racial violence.Mr. Bryant has called for another referendum on the flag. In an email, a spokesman described the lawsuit as a frivolous attempt to use the federal court system to usurp the will of the people.Although courts have sometimes intervened in matters about the Confederate flag, clashes about Southern heritage are mostly expected to play out in the legislatures and in local government meetings. Much of the pressure is on governors and legislative leaders, who have sometimes balked at scheduling hearings or votes on bills relating to the Confederacy. Not all the results favor Confederate symbols.On Thursday, Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia vetoed a bill that would have made it illegal for local officials to disturb or interfere with military memorials. On the same day, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida approved a plan to begin the long process of replacing a statue of a Confederate general that the state had added to the United States Capitols art collection.But there is sharp division in Louisiana, where New Orleans officials decided to remove four Confederate monuments and spurred an uproar that led to legal challenges and a bill in the Legislature. (In Mississippi, one lawmaker cited the Legislatures interest in material that promotes the historical integrity of Mississippi and its most revered Confederate icons and filed a resolution urging New Orleans to transfer the statues to Beauvoir.)What will happen in Alabama is uncertain. Despite bipartisan concerns about Mr. Allens bill seizing local power, the Senate easily approved the proposal. But lawmakers and lobbyists said the measure appeared to be in jeopardy in the House.Mr. Allen often notes that his legislation would offer equally rigid protections for monuments that draw little opposition these days, like one of Jesse Owens, the revered Olympian from Alabama who was black. But black lawmakers say that argument masks the intentions of the bill, which is similar to one that Tennessee lawmakers passed this month.Its not hard to see where its going, said Senator Rodger Smitherman, a Democrat. Its primary purpose, in my opinion, was to keep intact many of the monuments that were assembled and are a reflection of oppression.Mr. Bentley, in an interview in the State Capitol room where Alabama voted to secede, did not say what he would do if the Legislature passed Mr. Allens proposal.I believe in heritage, I believe in history, and I believe we should always honor history, and we do that in Alabama, said Mr. Bentley, who added quickly that we should take into account the sensitivity of all of our citizens on all issues.Public sentiment is mixed, but support for Confederate symbols remains.Days after opponents denounced Mr. Allens proposal in the Senate, a middle-aged man stopped at the Governors Mansions gift shop with a question: Do yall have any bronze medals with Jefferson Davis on them?The store, a worker reported, seemed to be out of stock."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES  The next marquee event at Hollywoods film academy: Identity Crisis  Part 2.On Tuesday, the 51-member governing board of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which normally convenes at night, will meet in a rare morning session. And high on the agenda, it is expected, will be the assessment of an Oscar show whose ratings tumbled as its host, Chris Rock, dealt bluntly with the racial politics engulfing the organization.About 34.4 million people watched the show on Feb. 28, close to a record low. The number of viewers ages 18 to 49, a demographic that advertisers pay a premium to reach, was believed to be the lowest on record, though the Oscar show remains the most watched among entertainment prize ceremonies.The annual review will take place against an increasingly messy backdrop.In an unusual step, the academy has asked ABC to begin negotiating a renewal of the networks 10-year agreement to air the Oscars, which does not expire until 2020. The move was described by people briefed on the situation, who requested anonymity because of confidentiality strictures, as an effort to guarantee future revenue as the historically cash-rich academy confronts the unaccustomed demands of its planned museum and $350 million in new borrowing that will be used to support it.But ABC, frustrated by the academys bureaucracy and concerned about declining ratings, has asked for more control of the show. (In another disruption, the academys chief marketing officer, Christina Kounelias, quit on Thursday to take a marketing position at Participant Media.)At the same time, academy governors on Tuesday will again wrestle with deep changes to the organizations membership and core mechanisms, as promised at an emergency session in late January, when the current crisis  occasionally verging on what seemed like a nervous breakdown  began in earnest.To bolster diversity in the makeup and governance of the academy, which includes about 7,000 film professionals, a large majority of whom are male and most of whom are white, the board then said it would add three members to be appointed, not elected. The goal is to increase the representation of women and ethnic minorities.But some of the emergency changes ran afoul of the academys own bylaws. On Tuesday, the governors are expected to implement the diversity changes with a formal revision of the bylaws.The new vote will follow a storm of criticism from academy members who objected to the speed and secrecy of the boards earlier action, which came on the heels of the Jan. 14 announcement of the Oscar nominations, with their all-white acting lineup. It also follows fierce resistance to an accompanying plan that would purge the awards voting rolls of older, inactive members.Some governors are now expected to propose a softening of the so-called activity requirement, perhaps by granting lifetime voting privileges to those who have worked in each of three decades, starting from their first film credit, rather than from the date of their academy admission, as currently planned.While that change seems minute, it might allow hundreds of members to sidestep the planned purge. But it might also make it harder for academy officials to meet their goal of doubling the number of female and nonwhite members in five years.The academy is reviewing the possible effect of such an adjustment. It is also studying a system that would give its branch committees  such as the actors or directors groups  some flexibility in counting credits, people briefed on the matter said.An academy spokeswoman declined to discuss its deliberations.But confusion, discord and considerable anger will probably remain part of the groups new normal, at least until the next awards season rolls around, regardless of what happens at the meeting.The rancor is a particular challenge for Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the academys president, who in the coming months has the option of standing for one more term, her fourth, as president, and for Dawn Hudson, its paid chief executive, whose three-year contract was renewed in 2014 after a contentious board fight.While the two have worked largely in harness through the diversity crisis, they are divided by personal style, institutional loyalties and designated functions.Ms. Isaacs, a former publicity executive for Paramount and New Line, is described by those who have worked closely with her as conservative by nature and deeply loyal both to academy traditions and to the sometimes invisible craftspeople  effects and design artists and such  who were instrumental in her election.Ms. Hudson, who joined the academy after serving as the executive director of Film Independent, a small art film organization, is said to be less patient with the academys old ways, more closely aligned with high-profile actors and filmmakers, and eager to break down a seeming cronyism that has contributed to its white, male makeup.Ms. Isaacs, like other recent academy presidents, has been increasingly involved in day-to-day operations of the organization. Ms. Hudson, at the same time, has not been shy about voicing strategic aims and concerns. In a January interview with the Hollywood Reporter, in which she spoke jointly with Ms. Isaacs and bizarrely claimed that the changes had been well received, Ms. Hudson questioned whether older academy members were sufficiently attuned to racial and gender issues.Look, some of these things are generational, they just are, she said.For Ms. Isaacs, Ms. Hudson and their many colleagues, the challenge will be to maintain consensus as the academy works through issues that may further alter the identity of the institution and its awards ceremony.In preliminary talks with ABC, for instance, the network has asked for more control over the content and promotion of the annual Oscar broadcast. One likely pool of resistance to any such network request: Those craft voters who elected Ms. Isaacs. They are wary of any move that might edge their categories out of a broadcast that almost everyone agrees is too long.As it confronts its identity issues, the academy will most likely also bump into another uncomfortable question: Might its new global campaign to recruit new members actually tighten the squeeze on African-Americans?Already, two-thirds of the Oscars awarded on last months show  including most of the six awards for the Australian-made Mad Max: Fury Road  went to artists from outside the United States. That contrasts sharply with the 1970s and 80s, when Americans dominated the awards, and a path opened for African-Americans including Whoopi Goldberg, Oprah Winfrey and Margaret Avery.To navigate those challenges will test the strength of any alignment between Ms. Hudson and Ms. Isaacs. They have been seeking common purpose at least since a conciliatory lunch that followed Ms. Hudsons contract renewal, which for a time Ms. Isaacs had opposed.So weird, Ms. Hudson wrote of her post-renewal session with Ms. Isaacs, in a May 9, 2014, email to the academy governor, and a supporter, Amy Pascal. I truly had love in my heart, and took her hand and said, Lets forget everything behind us and move forward. "}

{"text": "WASHINGTON   Brent Brown used to call Barack Obama a liar who had betrayed America. Then one day last year, while in the throes of a painful flare-up of his ulcerative colitis, he sat down and wrote Mr. Obama a letter thanking the president for saving his life.Mr. Browns improbable story  that of a Republican who campaigned against Mr. Obama but eventually came to credit the presidents signature health care law with his very survival  got the attention of the White House, where the mail has taken on an outsize role in the writing of Mr. Obamas legacy in his last year in office.So when it came time this month for Mr. Obama to promote the Affordable Care Act in Milwaukee, Mr. Brown, 32, got the chance to sit down for a lunch with the president, and then introduce him to a crowd of 700 at a middle school there.I would not be alive without access to care I received due to your law, Mr. Brown, who recently had surgery to treat his disorder, a chronic inflammation of the bowels, had written to the president. So thank you from a dumb young man who thought he knew it all and who said things about you that he now regrets.Mr. Obama has long cherished his mail as a way to break out of the bubble of the presidency. From the beginning of his time in office, his daily briefing book has included, at his insistence, 10 letters, which the White House refers to as the 10 LADs, for 10 letters a day, curated from the thousands that arrive each day.But these days, Mr. Obama is increasingly using the letters in his travels across the country to try to burnish his record and add more emotion to his message. Whenever the president is planning a trip somewhere, Fiona Reeves, the director of the Office of Presidential Correspondence, is asked to pore through her files to find letter writers in the area Mr. Obama may want to meet or feature onstage with him.They are, I think, the least-vetted content that he gets, Ms. Reeves said of the presidents letters. If you work at the White House and write something for the president, a lot of people review it to make sure its thorough or accurate, or that its ready for the president to see it. If you write to the president, you go through this pretty low-filter channel of our volunteers and staff and straight to his desk.On a recent Thursday, about 7,000 letters  about 70 percent of them emailed  arrived for Mr. Obama. Ms. Reeves described the number as fairly typical. Some topics stay at a steady hum in the presidents mail, such as student loans, immigration and gun violence. Ms. Reeves and her staff of 45, who read the mail, see huge increases in volume after major events like the Newtown, Conn., and Charleston, S.C., massacres, the Paris terrorist attacks, the government shutdown and the Supreme Court rulings legalizing same-sex marriage and upholding a pivotal element of the health care law.The letters supply Mr. Obama with piles of ready anecdotes that White House staff members say make policy, and the president, more accessible.A lot of times its easy to talk about issues in terms of the abstract and the statistical, but that doesnt resonate as much, said Jason Goldman, the director of Mr. Obamas Office of Digital Strategy, which draws on the letters to help amplify the presidents message through Facebook, Twitter and other channels. Its this sort of empathy shortcut where you immediately understand this persons perspective.There was Lisa Martin, a high school English teacher from Papillion, Neb., who wrote a middle-of-the-night letter to Mr. Obama about the sinking feeling of dread and sadness she felt about her newborn sons future because of the threats of climate change. Mr. Obama showed up in her living room in January before delivering a speech to 8,000 people in a stadium nearby.A couple of weeks later, it was Brianna Leathers of Sterling Heights, Mich., who in 2009 had written to Mr. Obama in round, bubbly print on lined notebook paper about her fears about the American automobile industry, then teetering on the edge of collapse. I am 13 years old, and Im worried about my familys future in Michigan, she wrote at the time.Mr. Obama made a trip to Detroit in January to talk about the success of the automobile rescue package he put in place just after taking office. The White House made sure Ms. Leathers, now a 20-year-old community college student, was in the audience. Mr. Goldmans office had her write an update  blasted to the White Houses email list of five million and shared on its social media platforms  outlining how she had been helped by Mr. Obamas efforts.Cody Keenan, Mr. Obamas speechwriter, who began his political career sorting through Senator Edward M. Kennedys mail, draws heavily from the presidents letters in drafting his message.I havent lived everybodys life, and neither has the president, Mr. Keenan said in an interview. The letters can give us a flavor of somebody elses life. Youve got to be able to speak to an audience where they are, and they let him do that.In August, the White House used Natoma Canfield, a cancer survivor whose 2010 letter to Mr. Obama pleading for health care reform hangs framed outside his office, to start a Tumblr site, Letters to President Obama, highlighting his mail.Mr. Obama is hardly the first president to receive, respond to or act on letters he receives from ordinary Americans, or to feature real-world stories to help him relate to a remote public.Presidents responding to personal communications from citizens goes back to the earliest days of the republic, said William A. Galston, a Brookings Institution scholar who served as a domestic policy adviser in Bill Clintons White House.Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he added, came on the scene and tried to establish this very personal connection with the fireside chats, and the saying at the time was, Its as if the president is in my living room.Mr. Brown never expected his letter would reach the president, figuring instead that it would probably go into an anonymous government inbox somewhere, never to be read by anyone.This is like writing to Santa, Mr. Brown said in an interview. Youre certainly not expecting a response.When the White House called asking him to introduce the president, he had little hesitation. He was so concerned that a future Republican president might repeal the health care measure, he said, that he had opted for surgery to remove his colon rather than to continue a less invasive and risky course: drug infusions that relieved his symptoms.Anyone who would say to me it was better the way it was before this law, Mr. Brown said, I just cant buy that."}

{"text": "Is a networking company that is just for professional women an avenue for leveling the playing field in the corporate world? Does your answer change after finding out that the company is called Girls Lounge and its events include mini-makeovers? If so, why?In Networking in the Girls Lounge, Brooks Barnes writes:In the most basic sense, the Girls Lounge is a free space  a hotel penthouse, for instance  where businesswomen can relax and mingle between meetings and seminars. There is fruit to snack on. Hair, nail and makeup experts offer mini-makeovers. Ms. Zalis, assisted by four full-time staff members, sometimes brings in a confidence coach to give pep talks. Pink flowers, throw pillows and plush sofas add to the slumber-party feel.Girls Lounge attendees  roughly 5,000 by now, Ms. Zalis estimates  are also encouraged to network and explore business deals, both with one another and with any men who find themselves in their midst. Gail Tifford, for instance, was unable to find a spot at a 2014 convention to discuss business with Stephen Quinn, who was then Walmarts chief marketing officer, so she asked him to meet her in the Girls Lounge.There were women in robes with their hair in towels, Ms. Tifford, vice president for media and digital engagement at Unilever North America, recalled with a laugh. Stephen and I went out to the terrace and had a very productive one-hour meeting.Mr. Quinn, who recently retired from Walmart, wrote in an email that it taught him something important about how women must feel when they are surrounded by men. It was kind of uncomfortable for me, he said. I clearly didnt fit in and distinctly had a feeling of a lot of eyes on me. Voice in my head: What is he doing here? Probably wasnt true, but my mind went there. As the Girls Lounge has grown, landing partners that include Visa and Google (and, at some events, The New York Times), so have Ms. Zaliss ambitions. Early on, she said, she was simply interested in the power of the pack: making women feel like less of a minority at heavily male business events. (Men outnumber women at Davos by more than five to one.) But then she noticed that Girls Lounge attendees were having meaningful conversations about sexism at work and how to combat it. The Girls Lounge definitely has its detractors. While reluctant to publicly criticize another woman, especially one working toward an admirable goal, a half-dozen women I approached  senior media executives, a retired state judge, lawyers  told me that they thought Ms. Zalis was hurting professional women by using the G word. A girl is a juvenile, someone who isnt ready, and Ive fought my entire career to avoid being perceived as that, one Warner Bros. executive said.Among the other comments: It sounds like a bathroom; Anything that makes us separate from men is harmful; I embrace my femininity  I wear dresses to work, I shop on business trips  but if I told my male colleagues that I was headed for the Girls Lounge, it would only cement in their minds that Im not as good as them.Even several of Ms. Zaliss supporters conceded that the Girls Lounge took some getting used to. Its an unlikely name for what is really going on there, said Joanna Barsh, a director emeritus at McKinsey & Company. Ms. Barsh added: Shelley is not making a difference because shes timid. Shes brazen. This woman is a force of nature  an extraordinary, energized bundle.Students: Read the whole article then answer the questions below: Do you think the Girls Lounge offers a solution to what Ms. Zalis calls the boys club in the business world? How do you think the article would be different, if at all, had it been written by a woman? Explain. What do you think of Ms. Zalis decision to pour on the pink at the Girls Lounge as a show of standing out, not trying to fit in, as she claims shes been advised to do in the workplace? Knowing that Stephen Quinn, who is male, had had a meeting with a woman in the space rented by the Girls Lounge suggests that there isnt a no men allowed rule there. How, if at all, does that affect your opinion of the Girls Lounge? What is your reaction to Mr. Quinns description of how he felt when he was there?Our Student Council member Aleena Ismail suggested this article as a Student Opinion question. She writes:The Girls Lounge has been quite controversial for its use of the word girl, its creation of an exclusive space, but mostly its emphasis on women doing stereotypically girly things.This article makes me reflect on whether all of these different paths for female empowerment can run parallel or whether they are divisive at a time when women need to come together.She suggests these questions: Do women have to minimize their feminity in order to be taken seriously by men? Does offering spaces where women do stereotypically girly things such as getting manicures and makeovers enforce traditional gender roles or is it a kind of empowerment? Does a space like the Girls Lounge exclude women who dont fit the mold it embraces? Is it signficant that this article appears in the Fashion & Style section as opposed to Business Day?Students 13 and older are invited to comment below.

{"text": "SEOUL, South Korea   The North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, said his country would soon conduct another nuclear test and also flight-test ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, the countrys state-run news media reported Tuesday.If Mr. Kim follows through with those threats, that would mean North Korea was readying its fifth nuclear test and was preparing to conduct more missile launchings in defiance of the sanctions resolution the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted this month against the country.Mr. Kim declared that a nuclear warhead explosion test and a test-fire of several kinds of ballistic rockets able to carry nuclear warheads will be conducted in a short time to further enhance the reliance of nuclear attack capability, the Norths official Korean Central News Agency reported Tuesday.Mr. Kim made the comments while observing officials conducting a simulation test of re-entry technology, the news agency said. The technology is needed for a warhead on an intercontinental ballistic missile to survive heat and turbulence while plunging through the atmosphere toward its target.Although North Korea has repeatedly threatened to launch nuclear strikes against the United States, officials and analysts have questioned how close the country has come to acquiring such technology, as well as the ability to guide a long-range missile.Although Mr. Kim said that his country has the re-entry technology, it has never flight-tested a long-range missile.Fears have grown, however, that the country was mastering technologies to build such a missile. It launched a long-range rocket to put a satellite into orbit on Feb. 7. On Jan. 6, it conducted its fourth nuclear test.Since the sanctions resolution, North Korea has issued a series of threats and claims about its nuclear ability.It threatened to launch pre-emptive nuclear strikes at the United States. It also said that it had standardized miniaturized nuclear warheads to be fitted on its missiles. Last Friday, the North said Mr. Kim had ordered more nuclear tests, though it did not give a time frame.On Sunday, a North Korean website quoted a nuclear scientist as saying that the country had a hydrogen bomb, and that if it were dropped on Manhattan, all its residents will die instantly and the whole city will turn into piles of ashes. The North has said a hydrogen bomb was tested on Jan. 6, though American officials dismissed that claim, given the blasts relatively small explosive power.It is often difficult to tell propaganda from a genuine threat in North Korean statements. The country tends to sound more bellicose and bombastic when the United States and South Korea conduct joint annual war games, as they are doing now."}
{"text": "Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, the prolific English composer long known as an anti-establishment anti-monarchist avant-gardist enfant terrible  but whose work was so renowned that he was named Queen Elizabeth IIs official music master anyway  died on Monday at his home in the Orkney Islands of Scotland. He was 81.His death, from leukemia, was announced on his website, maxopus.com.Knighted by the queen in 1987, Mr. Davies (pronounced Davis) was also a respected conductor. He served as an associate conductor of Britains Royal Philharmonic and BBC Philharmonic Orchestras, and made guest appearances with ensembles including the Cleveland Orchestra, the Boston Symphony and the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra.He was associated in particular with the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, of which he was a composer laureate.Mr. Davies served as Master of the Queens Revels (a ceremonial post, dating to the 16th century, that is analogous to the poet laureate) from 2004 to 2014. In that capacity, he composed works for royal occasions including Christmas festivities and the birthdays of the queen and Prince Charles.His appointment had set tongues wagging and eyebrows soaring across Britain, for Mr. Davies was, by proud circumstance and ardent choice, about as far outside the august imperial mainstream as one could be: working-class, openly gay, far left of center politically and adamantly isolationist personally.Since the early 1970s, he had made his home in the windswept Orkneys, living for much of that time in relative inaccessibility, without electricity or running water.Musically, Mr. Davies could be inaccessible as well, writing scores that were technically and aurally demanding. Concertgoers over the years sometimes booed his new works, and occasionally walked out.His work, often dissonant, made abundant use of the musical interval known as the diminished fifth, or tritone. A painfully unstable two-note chord, known historically as the devils interval, the tritone begs for acoustic resolution but does not always find it, a state of affairs that taxes the nerves.But his music could also incline toward lyricism, and it eventually came to be so highly regarded that Mr. Davies was celebrated as one of the most eminent postwar composers in the world.Generically, Mr. Davies cast a vast net, writing symphonies, chamber pieces, works for solo instruments and  the output for which he was perhaps best known  a bevy of music-theater compositions: operas, ballets, staged songs, works for children and film scores, including two, The Devils (1971) and The Boy Friend (1971), for the director Ken Russell.Stylistically, he was Janus-headed, looking simultaneously forward to the music of the postserial period and backward to Medieval and Renaissance church music. An impassioned ecumenicist, he could companionably marry Renaissance liturgical music to a foxtrot, as he did on at least one occasion, in Missa Super lHomme Arm, an opera of 1968.Mr. Daviess best-known works include Eight Songs for a Mad King (1969), a staged cycle for male singer and instrumental ensemble.Its libretto, by Randolph Stow, is based partly on rantings attributed to King George III. It includes lines like Dear land of sheep and cabbages. Dear land./Dear elms, oaks, beeches, strangling ivy,/green snakes of ivy, pythons, as well as squeaks, squeals and grunts.In one performance of the work, at Carnegie Recital Hall in 1970, Mr. Daviess protagonist (played by the composer Julius Eastman) was directed to grab a violin from one of the musicians, tear its strings off and smash it to bits. In another, an inflammatory 1987 staging by David Freeman in London, the hero performed while sitting naked on a toilet and smearing what appeared to be excrement about the stage.Reviewing the Carnegie Recital Hall performance in The New York Times, Harold C. Schonberg wrote, A composer who is going to set this kind of material cannot do it in an orthodox manner. He added approvingly: Eight Songs for a Mad King is a theater piece that has direct communication, and it hits the listener like a collective shriek from Bedlam.Mr. Davies's most frequently performed vocal work was almost certainly The Lighthouse (1979), a haunting chamber opera rooted in the true story of three Scottish lighthousekeepers who mysteriously vanished in 1900. He was also known for Taverner (1972), a two-act opera based on the life of the 16th-century English composer John Taverner, whose music Mr. Davies esteemed.His instrumental compositions include string quartets; 10 symphonies, the last completed in 2013, when Mr. Davies was already ill with leukemia; the Strathclyde Concertos, a cycle of 10 concertos for various solo instruments  the violin concerto was recorded by Isaac Stern  and works for solo piano.Mr. Davies considered composing to be a moral act, and many of his compositions had overtly political wellsprings. Among them were his String Quartet No. 3, composed in opposition to the Iraq war, and Kommilitonen! a 2011 opera in praise of student protesters, including James Meredith, the black man who fought to enter the University of Mississippi, and the anti-Nazi agitator Sophie Scholl.Though many of Mr. Daviess compositions sprang from political ire, others were born, evocatively, of the sea-loud islands where he lived most often alone.Peter Maxwell Davies, familiarly known as Max, was born on Sept. 8, 1934, in Salford, near Manchester. His father was a factory manager, and for young Max, the prospect of a career in the factory or the mines seemed virtually certain.At 4, Max was taken to a performance of Gilbert and Sullivans operetta The Gondoliers. He came home able to sing the entire score note for note and vowed then and there to be a composer. Though it was an unheard-of ambition in his family circle, he had his parents support.I remember listening from upstairs to an argument my uncle had with my parents, Mr. Davies told The Sunday Times of London in 2004. He was saying, Surely you arent going to let that lad of yours do music when I can offer him a bricklaying apprenticeship. My parents were saying that I had a scholarship and had to have a chance.He went on to study at the Royal Manchester College of Music, as it was then known, where his classmates included Harrison Birtwistle, who also became an eminent composer. Mr. Davies later studied at Princeton with Roger Sessions and Milton Babbitt.With Mr. Birtwistle and others, Mr. Davies founded the Pierrot Players, a music-theater ensemble, in the mid-1960s. The group performed many of Mr. Daviess early works, including Revelation and Fall, a monodrama for soprano in which the singer, as the British newspaper The Telegraph wrote in its obituary on Monday, is required to howl a text by the Austrian poet Georg Trakl into a megaphone.For many years, Mr. Davies lived on the island of Hoy in the Orkneys, where he allowed little of the electrified world  including television, to which he objected tonally  to impinge.I experimented with it for a year but found it intrusive, especially the BBC News presentation, he told the The Guardian in 2004. The signature tune was in E major. Such a special key, reserved for works like Bruckners Seventh Symphony and Beethovens Opus 109 Sonata.Over time Hoy proved too accessible, and Mr. Davies later moved to Sanday, an even remoter Orkney island, where he lived to the end of his life.Mr. Davies began his conducting career leading performances of his own compositions, partly because some established conductors found them too daunting. He was widely recorded, both as a conductor of his own work and that of other modernists and, as a composer, by conductors including John Williams, Andr Previn and Oliver Knussen.Despite his deep desire for solitude, Mr. Davies was often the subject of unsolicited publicity. In 2005, he made headlines after he was apprehended with a terrine he had made from a swan, a protected bird that is considered the property of the British Crown.Mr. Davies, who explained that the swan had been killed when it flew into a power line near his home, received an official caution from the police but was not charged.In 2012, the British press made much of Mr. Daviess acrimonious separation from his lover, Colin Parkinson, with whom he had lived for a decade.An only child, Mr. Davies leaves no known immediate survivors.Mr. Davies remained deliciously dyspeptic to the last. After ringing cellphones proliferated among concert-hall audiences, he publicly deemed their possessors artistic terrorists and declared they should be fined. He was in the habit of walking out of shops and restaurants whenever Muzak was played. He walked out often.For all this, he had by the end of his life become an establishment figure  comparatively, anyway. His career as a public luminary was one that his family could scarcely have imagined when he began his work.In an interview with The Sunday Herald of Glasgow in 2005, Mr. Davies recalled his fathers words after the premiere of Taverner at the Royal Opera House in 1972  an event that The Guardian, decades later, would call one of the landmarks in British postwar music.Approaching the opera houses director, George Lascelles  the seventh Earl of Harewood and a cousin of the queen  the elder Mr. Davies was heard to say, Tell me this, Mr. Airwood, this stuff wot our Max writes, do you think itll go?"}
{"text": "Given the teams that expressed interest in Matt Forte, he could have played with some of the N.F.L.s best quarterbacks: Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers or Tony Romo.New England, Green Bay and Dallas, as well as Tampa Bay, which is led by the promising No. 1 draft pick Jameis Winston, pursued Forte to varying degrees during free agency. So did the Jets, whose quarterback situation remains unresolved.Forte acknowledged there was some apprehension about signing with a team without a quarterback, but that ultimately did not deter him.I also think that much about the organization and the team dynamic right now, he said Monday during a conference call.One of the N.F.L.s most productive running backs over the past eight seasons, Forte signed a three-year deal with the Jets last week. Before free agency began, his former Chicago Bears teammate Brandon Marshall raved to him about Ryan Fitzpatrick, and Forte said he hoped his decision would entice Fitzpatrick to return as the Jets quarterback.I would expect and hope it would be him, just to build off what they had last year, Forte said.Fitzpatrick and the Jets remain locked in a stalemate that does not appear to be nearing an end. The Jets do not have any urgency to budge from their offer because competition has yet to emerge for him.Forte attracted suitors because of his consistency and versatility. He ran for fewer than 900 yards (898) last season for the first time in his career, and only because he missed three games with a knee injury. According to Pro Football Reference, he has caught the most passes by a running back, 487, since he entered the league in 2008.Only Chris Johnson and Adrian Peterson have more carries during that time, but Forte, 30, said he felt strong and healthy.After the season, I took three weeks, and I was feeling really good after those three weeks, Forte said. Usually it takes almost two months to feel good after the season.From conversations with coaches, Forte said he expected to be used as an every-down back, though the Jets are likely to integrate Bilal Powell and their other free-agent signing at running back, Khiry Robinson.The Bears informed Forte a month ago that they would not re-sign him, a move that surprised him. He thought they would at least extend an offer.Soon after, he encountered Marshall at a conference in Denver. Forte told him the teams he thought would be interested, and Marshall began recruiting him to the Jets, who had another former Bears teammate, tight end Kellen Davis.At that time, I didnt really think that the Jets actually would be the front-runner, Forte said. But as it got closer and closer, I started thinking about how it would actually be a good fit.Once free agency came, Forte said, the Jets ended up being the perfect fit for him."}
{"text": "The American Bar Associations accrediting body put law schools on notice Monday that it intended to tighten a rule that sets a deadline for graduates to pass state bar exams  a near-universal requirement for becoming a practicing lawyer.The new measure would clarify the existing deadline that 75 percent of students pass within two years. Bar passage rates have been falling noticeably across the country.At issue for the schools is their accreditation by the association. The theory behind the rule, which is one factor in accreditation, is that schools should be accepting students who are likely to have the qualifications to become practicing lawyers. Proponents of the change say that schools exploit students when they accept those who  based on admissions tests and other measurements  have a small chance of succeeding.Although the current rule was intended to require passage of the bar in two years, the language is fuzzy and full of loopholes that effectively give schools as long as five years to meet the goal.The change would eliminate more than 700 words of explanation from the rule as it stands now, and leave a single sentence.The vagueness in the existing rule has allowed most schools to avoid being held accountable, although at least two, both in California, were placed on probation for low bar passage rates. The probation of each has since been lifted. Accreditation of two other California schools was temporarily withdrawn, in part because of bar passage issues.The revision, proposed by the associations Section of Legal Education and Admission to the Bar, is subject to a hearing and a comment period. Approval by the full A.B.A. would most likely come in February 2017. Some schools are expected to push back against the effort to place a firm lid on student outcomes, especially if they have elected to admit students with less traditional qualifications.Bar exam passage rates have been dropping in big states including California, New York, Florida and New Jersey. Georgia, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia also were stung by lower passage rates after the July 2015 exam. The bar exam is also given in February, but most graduates take it the summer after their graduation from law school.The bar passage rate in California, for example, sank last year to its lowest point since 1986. In New York, the overall passage rate for test takers last July was at its lowest point since 2004. Floridas rate also dropped slightly, although other big states like New Jersey had steady overall passage rates.Entering the legal profession means measuring up to tough standards, but the numerical qualifications, like admissions test scores and grade point averages, of students have declined, and fewer people are applying to law school. The number of applicants last year fell to 54,130 compared with just under 88,000 five years earlier, according to the Law School Admissions Council, which tracks the data."}

{"text": "Retirement may be good for your health, a new study suggests.Australian researchers followed a group of 27,257 men and women, 3,106 of whom retired during the three-year study period. They compared retirees with their peers who were still working, looking at such health measures as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diet and sleep.Retirees were also asked why they retired: health problems, caring for others, lack of job opportunities or lifestyle reasons like the desire to travel or study. The study is in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.After adjusting for initial health risks, they found that on average, retirees walked for 17 minutes more a week, and engaged in moderate-intensity exercise 45 minutes more a week. They slept about 15 minutes more a night than they did when they were working. Women retirees were more likely to quit smoking than their still-working peers.There were no significant differences between retirees and those still working, when it came to alcohol use or fruit and vegetable consumption.The authors had no information about the participants type of occupation, and they acknowledge that the follow-up period was short.This points to a happier picture, said the lead author, Melody Ding, a senior research fellow at the University of Sydney. It allows people to look at retirement optimistically. But there are successful and unsuccessful retirements. Its important not to over-generalize these results.For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}
{"text": "A Long Island man from a wealthy family who argued he was brainwashed to kill his cousins former boyfriend was convicted of attempted murder on Monday, after a lengthy trial that featured expert witnesses who testified about the effect of indoctrination on a weak psyche.A Manhattan jury took only 50 minutes to find the man, Jacob Nolan, 23, guilty of all charges in connection with the bludgeoning and stabbing of Michael Weiss, an Upper West Side psychiatrist, in his home office on West 57th Street on Nov. 12, 2012.Mr. Nolan showed no expression as the jury foreman read the verdict, while his mother broke into tears in the audience. He was found guilty of attempted murder, burglary and assault, and could be sentenced to between five and 25 years on the top charge.Defense lawyers never disputed that Mr. Nolan, who had a history of mental illness, went to Mr. Weisss apartment that day with a sledgehammer and a knife in a duffel bag. Mr. Weiss testified that Mr. Nolan tried to hit him in the head with the sledgehammer, then stabbed him seven times, before he was able to break free.But the defense argued that Mr. Nolan was not acting of his own volition. They said he had been programmed by Mr. Weisss former girlfriend, Pamela Buchbinder, who was involved in a bitter custody battle with Mr. Weiss over their young son.In the weeks leading up to the attack, Mr. Nolan had been living with Ms. Buchbinder, a 43-year-old cousin who is also a psychiatrist.Steven Brounstein, a defense lawyer, said in his closing argument that Ms. Buchbinder had taken advantage of Mr. Nolans mental illness and submissive personality, indoctrinating him with the idea that Mr. Weiss had to be eliminated because he posed a threat to her son.Mr. Brounstein contended Ms. Buchbinder had turned Mr. Nolan into a weapon, and he argued Mr. Nolan was so brainwashed that he did not understand the consequences of his actions, sitting down after the attack and taking bloody photos of himself rather than fleeing. He was putty, Mr. Brounstein argued. He was sand in the hands of a master.But the lead prosecutor, Linda Ford, argued that Mr. Nolan, though mentally ill, knew precisely what he was doing and intended to kill Mr. Weiss. She said his motive might have been to help Ms. Buchbinder because he craved her approval and love, but he still had the mental capacity to understand his acts.Hes a young man who is fully functional, she said. Mentally ill? Absolutely. He has bipolar disease. That doesnt turn him into a babbling idiot who has no control over his faculties.The night before the attack, Ms. Buchbinder and Mr. Nolan bought the sledgehammer at Home Depot, according to evidence presented at the trial. In addition, Ms. Buchbinder had drawn a map for Mr. Nolan, instructing him how to gain access to Mr. Weisss apartment.Ms. Buchbinder has not been charged with any crime in connection with the assault.Defense lawyers pleaded with Justice Thomas Farber of State Supreme Court to take steps to ensure that Mr. Nolan, the son of a wealthy real estate investor, continue to receive medications in prison. Justice Farber said he would ask the New York City Correction Department to place him on a suicide watch."}
{"text": "CAIRO   Two air force pilots from the United Arab Emirates were killed on Monday when their warplane crashed while fighting over Yemen, according to Saudi Arabias official news agency.The news agency blamed a technical malfunction for the crash, but the claim was impossible to verify independently. Local media reported that the plane, a French Mirage, had crashed in Yemens southern port city of Aden, and showed pictures of the wreckage.Saudi Arabia announced the deaths in its capacity as the leader of a coalition of Arab states that has been fighting a rebel group in Yemen known as the Houthis for almost a year.The crash was at least the third crash or downing of a coalition fighter jet in the conflict. And it was the latest setback for the United Arab Emirates, one of the coalitions most visible and active participants, which has lost scores of soldiers in Houthi rocket strikes or militant attacks.The crash also came amid growing international concern about the broader consequences of the Saudi-led intervention in Yemen, which has received military support from the United States. More than 6,000 people, nearly half of them civilians, have been killed in a conflict that has shown no sign of abating and has resulted in what aid workers say is one of the worlds worst humanitarian crises.Sunni Muslim extremist groups, including Al Qaedas powerful local affiliate and a branch of the Islamic State, have gained strength while fighting alongside Saudi-backed forces against the Houthis. The militant groups have capitalized on the war to gain territory in southern Yemen.For most of the conflict, the coalition appeared to ignore the expanding reach of the Sunni militants while it focused its firepower on territory controlled by the Houthis, a Shiite-led group whom the Saudis regard as a proxy force for Shiite Iran, Saudi Arabias main regional rival. In recent days, though, the coalition for the first time has been forced to bomb territory that it had claimed to control, in Aden, to counter the growing presence of Qaeda militants there."}
{"text": "The finals of the National Council Auditions that the Metropolitan Opera hosts each year must be daunting for the young contestants who vie for one of five top prizes. Its not just one of the most reliably career-accelerating competitions in opera. Its also held in the largest opera house, with an auditorium that can dwarf even experienced voices.But when the Korean-born baritone Sol Jin took the stage on Sunday afternoon to perform Di Provenza il mar from Verdis La Traviata, something odd happened: The hall seemed to shrink, filled to the brim with the sound of a majestic, powerful and elegantly burnished voice.It happened again when Mr. Jin, the third of this years nine finalists, who all performed with the Met Orchestra under the baton of Antony Walker, returned to sing a selection from Tchaikovskys The Queen of Spades. Both these pieces are lyrical arias demanding expression and nuance rather than gladiatorial prowess, and Mr. Jin delivered singing of mature refinement, buoyed by such commanding amplitude and projection that a visible jolt went through the audience each time he sang.There was little surprise mixed in with the cheers, then, when the soprano Deborah Voigt, the host of Sundays proceedings, announced Mr. Jin as one of the winners. Also memorable was the soprano Yelena Dyachek from California, who demonstrated impressive range, depth and power in Come scoglio from Mozarts Cos Fan Tutte before delivering an emotionally captivating Letter Scene from Tchaikovskys Eugene Onegin.The Polish countertenor Jakub Jozef Orlinski combined beauty of tone and an uncommon unity of color and polish across his range in selections by Britten and Handel. The Italian-Canadian mezzo Emily DAngelo, with a voice hued like polished teak, proved vivacious and nimble in a Rossini comic number, and arrestingly vulnerable in an aria from Barbers Vanessa. Also deservedly among the winners was the baritone Sean Michael Plumb, who brought elegant lyricism and responsive musicality to music by Rossini and Tchaikovsky.If I could have awarded one more prize, it would have gone to the baritone Theo Hoffman, who sang scenes from Korngolds Die Tote Stadt and Glucks Iphignie en Tauride with refined intensity and  especially in the Korngold  a seemingly intuitive understanding of how to integrate a voice into a plush orchestral texture.It was also gratifying to see singers who had seemed uncomfortable in their first arias improve in the second half. The tenor Jonas Hacker, who had struggled to unify melody and ornament in a Mozart aria, came back with a selection from Delibess Lakm that allowed the sweetness of his tone to unfold freely. The profusion of quick-patter language in Largo al factotum from Rossinis The Barber of Seville had gotten the better of the baritone Brian Vu at the start of the afternoon; when he returned with an aria from Gounods Faust the broad lyrical line revealed an ample and pleasing tone. The mellow warmth of Lauren Feiders soprano lit up selections from Strausss Arabella and Brittens Peter Grimes, part of an afternoon that  as competitions go  offered a satisfying range of repertoire."}
{"text": "Lloyd S. Shapley, who shared the 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science for work on game theory that has been used to study subjects as diverse as matching couples and allocating costs, died on Saturday in Tucson. He was 92.He broke a hip several weeks ago, his son Peter said in confirming the death.Dr. Shapley, a mathematician and emeritus professor at U.C.L.A., was considered one of the fathers of game theory, which tries to explain the choices that competitors make in situations that require strategic thinking. The Shapley value, named for him, is a concept through which the benefits of cooperation can be proportionally divided among participants based on their relative contribution.He was a close friend and mentor to John Forbes Nash Jr., a mathematician and Nobel laureate who had schizophrenia. Sylvia Nasar, a former reporter for The New York Times, devoted a chapter in her 1998 biography of Mr. Nash, A Beautiful Mind, to the mens friendship. (The book was adapted for a 2001 film.)Ms. Nasar said the books title was suggested by a remark by Dr. Shapley. He was obnoxious, Ms. Nasar quoted him as saying about Nash. What redeemed him was a keen, beautiful, logical mind.Born in Cambridge, Mass., on June 2, 1923, Lloyd Stowell Shapley was one of five children of Martha and Harlow Shapley, a noted astronomer at Harvard University. He was studying mathematics at Harvard when World War II started, and left to join the Army Air Corps. He was assigned to a weather station at a secret air base in western China that also intercepted broadcasts. There he earned a Bronze Star for deciphering a Soviet weather code. After the war, he earned degrees from Harvard and Princeton University.In a 1962 paper he co-wrote, Dr. Shapley explained how individuals, like those seeking a partner, could be placed in a stable relationship even if they disagreed about the qualities that made a perfect match. His ideas laid the groundwork for the development of other matching systems, like ones involving kidney donors and recipients.He worked at the RAND Corporation before joining the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1981. Dr. Shapley was one of the giants of game theory, Gene Block, the chancellor of U.C.L.A., said in a statement.Dr. Shapley and Alvin E. Roth, a Harvard professor, received the Nobel Prize in 2012 in recognition of their work on market design and matching theory. While they did not work together, Professor Roth applied Dr. Shapleys ideas to practical problems.In announcing the award, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences described their work as addressing a central economic problem: how to match different agents as well as possible. For example, the citation said, students have to be matched with schools, and donors of human organs with patients in need of a transplant.Dr. Shapley expressed surprise when told about the economics award. Im a mathematician, Im not an economist, he said. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University recently developed a website called Spliddit, which uses the Shapley value concept to help people divide the costs of shared rents or cab rides equitably.Besides his son Peter, Dr. Shapley is survived by another son, Christopher, and two grandchildren. His wife of 42 years, Marian, died in 1997."}

{"text": "STRASBOURG, France  The protection of refugees is an integral part of the international order for safeguarding human rights that countries developed in the aftermath of the atrocities of World War II. Its in that context that European nations agreed on an array of rules on human rights and the treatment of refugees, resulting in probably the worlds best-functioning system for protecting them.Now, however, the refugee crisis unfolding along the borders of the European Union has elicited a chaotic response. There is a clear danger that the union and its member states are losing their way, and are at risk of backsliding on fundamental commitments.The deal the European Council is discussing with Turkey is a case in point. In exchange for concessions on visa requirements for Turks traveling to Europe, the European Union is asking Ankara to take back all migrants, including refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and others, who are currently crossing from Turkey into Greece by irregular means; the European Union proposes in turn to accept an equivalent number of Syrian refugees directly from Turkey.Some union officials are portraying this deal as a good solution to the crisis. In reality, the automatic forced return that the deal allows is illegal and will be ineffective.It is illegal because forced returns run contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits the collective expulsions of aliens. They also violate the right to seek asylum that was established in 1948 by the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and contravene guarantees established by the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention, which recognizes that seeking asylum can require refugees to breach immigration rules.International law does not call into question a countrys right, in principle, to repatriate people who do not need international protection. But it does prohibit actions that are incompatible with states obligations under those conventions.In 2002, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Belgium had failed to take sufficient account of asylum seekers personal circumstances in a case involving collective expulsions. The Strasbourg court has continued to uphold that position in other cases. The latest of these, two years ago, concerned a group of Afghans, Sudanese and Eritreans who had entered Italy irregularly and were immediately expelled to Greece.As for why the European Unions deal with Turkey is unlikely to work, it is obvious that as soon as the agreement goes into effect, the Syrian refugees  together with their smugglers  will find other ways to reach Europe. They will keep taking dangerous routes because, risky as they are, these journeys offer more hope than the prospect of living for years in refugee camps or, worse, of being caught up in the continuing violence of the Syrian conflict.No deal is better than a bad deal. Instead of racking their brains to find a legal fig leaf for measures like collective expulsions, the European Councils members should have the courage to scrap the deal. Instead, they should adopt bold measures at the summit meeting this week that would radically shift the unions approach to migration.There is no magic wand that can solve this complex issue in the short run, but European countries are well aware that a range of longer-term solutions are available. Their first step should be to unite behind the negotiations toward a political solution to the conflict in Syria.Then they must ramp up the relocation of asylum seekers from Greece and Italy to resettlement centers elsewhere in Europe. Member states should ensure that the so-called hot spots in Southern Europe have the capacity to assess asylum claims and return individuals who do not qualify for refugee protection. But this can be done only in full compliance with human rights standards, in particular honoring the prohibitions of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.A third measure must be to increase European Union support for Greece and Macedonia to help them handle the immediate humanitarian emergency. Turkey should also receive help, since it is the first entry point to Europe and is already hosting about three million refugees.European countries must also add to the legal options available to refugees from conflict areas and neighboring countries seeking protection in our Continent. As the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (also known as the United Nations Refugee Agency) has proposed, tools like humanitarian admission programs, private sponsorships, family reunion policies, student scholarships and labor mobility programs can help refugees avoid resorting to smugglers. Initiatives like these are already working: Just last month, Italy admitted 93 Syrian refugees directly from camps in Lebanon. A high-level meeting to promote legal avenues for admitting Syrian refugees, to be held on March 30 in Geneva under the auspices of the United Nations Refugee Agency, is an opportunity for countries to make concrete pledges.Its vital that the European Union states find ways to coordinate and share responsibility for tackling the migrant crisis. That will include establishing registration centers in the main countries of arrival, and setting up a system to distribute asylum requests equitably across Europe, among both union members and nonmembers.These measures will require political leadership, as well as considerable resources. But if the chaotic arrivals and states beggar-thy-neighbor responses continue, together with backsliding on human rights commitments, they will eventually impose even greater political, social and economic costs.All Europes states are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights and the United Nations Refugee Convention. To hold true to these moral and legal commitments, they must meet this crisis with policies that comply with them."}
{"text": "Strings McCrane, a country music and movie star, talks way too much, and half the time he doesnt even know what hes saying. As embodied by an entertainingly irritating Timothy Olyphant in Hold On to Me Darling, which opened on Monday night at the Linda Gross Theater of the Atlantic Theater Company, Strings is a walking, whining confirmation of our suspicions that the rich and famous really are different from you and me: Theyre a lot more shallow and needy.Still, youre likely to find yourself hanging on every one of Stringss self-contradicting, self-dramatizing words. Thats because he is the creation of Kenneth Lonergan, a writer with one of the best ears around for the language of the morally challenged  a term that I would say applies to most of the human race.Like springtime, plays from Mr. Lonergan always feel too long in the coming and usually arrive with an awakening joy. The author of This Is Our Youth (which was revived on Broadway in 2014) and the screenplay for You Can Count on Me (2000), Mr. Lonergan is notorious for holding on to his scripts, rewriting and inflating and, sometimes, undermining them. (The original date on the script for Hold On to Me Darling is Jan. 7, 2005.)In other words, you might expect Mr. Lonergan to have a natural affinity for obsessive, self-sabotaging people. And so it proves with Darling, a poignant comic study of the bad faith and bad behavior of a narcissistic celebrity and those around him. This includes his longtime personal assistant, his blue-collar brother and the women who fall for him like ninepins  all given vibrant life by the director, Neil Pepe, and a cast that finds the individual quirkiness in everyday stereotypes.The basic premise here has been a staple of satire since Marie Antoinette got in touch with her inner milkmaid: Spoiled, insulated royalty develops a yen for so-called real life. For the 39-year-old Strings, described as the third-biggest crossover star in the history of country music, this yearning arrives when he hears that his beloved, exasperating mother  a woman he could never please  has died.Strings is not one to grieve silently. Within minutes of our meeting him in a Kansas City hotel suite (hes in town to make a space movie), he has smashed up his guitar and delivered many windy pronouncements about how lonely and empty his world is, declarations that sound a lot like lyrics-in-waiting for one of his songs.But this country boy cant help it. Hes been brainwashed by two decades of fame as the bard of the common folk, and he sees himself in the two glamorous dimensions in which the worlds gaze has frozen him. Before you can say breach of contract, hes thrown away his multimillion-dollar career to return to the Tennessee town where he grew up, not just for his mamas funeral, but also to start a new life as a simple man.You can pretty much predict how successful this transformation will be. And you may initially wonder just why Mr. Lonergan has chosen a plot that has been recycled so many times. But although this production could still be trimmed by 10 or 15 minutes, the strength of Darling is in its loquacity. It lets its characters talk and talk, and the more we listen, the more we learn about how they hear themselves.Mr. Lonergan allows them all, even Strings, flashes of self-awareness. Mostly, though, theyre hypnotized by the holy sheen of celebrity. In showing how these transfixed people are destined to act as they do, Darling becomes a tragicomic commentary on a culture ruled by the religion of fame. This play even makes room for its characters to speak on this very subject, but in ways that show how they remain victims of the clichs of that same mesmerizing mythology.Such observations have been the stuff of pop sociology for many years. What makes them so fresh here is how Mr. Lonergans dialogue  and the marvelous cast members that deliver it  endows them with spontaneous life. (Walt Spanglers sets  which conjure both the existential hell of contemporary anonymous hotel rooms and the claustrophobic folksiness of small-town Tennessee  and Suttirat Anne Larlarbs costumes feed the shows radiant verisimilitude.)Like Mr. Lonergans script, none of the performers exaggerate or condescend to their characters. Best known for his television work (Deadwood, Justified), Mr. Olyphant avoids the obvious route of histrionic posing. Instead, his Strings  physically, a ringer for the young Randy Travis  is a man of understated overstatement, of matter-of-fact melodrama. Its an approach that both befits Stringss outsize iconic stature and matches the teary sensibility of country ballads. (His new album has the blissful title Aint No Time for Cryin.)As his half brother, Duke, a wonderfully wry C. J. Wilson lets us see clearly the intelligence and restlessness that run in the family. Keith Nobbs provides a fierce, almost feral comic portrait of Jimmy, Stringss personal assistant of 12 years, defensively poised to protect his employer and his own privileged position.Jimmy is quick to detect the threat posed by Nancy, the hotel masseuse whom Strings meets in the first scene and embraces as an avatar of the real world. Portrayed with carnivorous relish by Jenn Lyon, Nancy is a pious opportunist who knows just how to play her Strings and to vanquish a rival like the sweet Essie (Adelaide Clemens), Stringss distant cousin, who shows up at his mothers funeral.Ms. Clemens, an Australian actress who appears on television in Rectify, captures exactly the inflections and guardedness of the small-town American South. Essies blend of innocence and canniness is deeply touching, and she provides a jolt of real feeling in a world of synthetic emotions.So does the character affectingly portrayed by Jonathan Hogan, who arrives late in the play in the Rosebud revelation in Stringss life. Such moments of recognition usually elicit eye rolling.But the startling, bona fide sorrow that Mr. Olyphant brings to this encounter  in which Strings could be said to be forced off the script of his spotlighted life for the first time  truly illuminates everything that has come before. As a prisoner of fame, Strings may not know whats authentic anymore. Mr. Lonergan definitely does."}

{"text": "If youve watched any television, youve seen drug ads  a lot of them. Drug companies spend several billion dollars a year on direct-to-consumer advertising. Count them and there are 80 drug ads an hour.Do drug ads provide useful information, as the pharmaceutical industry maintains? Or do ads just promote wasteful use of expensive new drugs, justifying regulation to rein them in? Those questions have taken on new importance as spending on drug ads has grown. Gilead Sciences, for example, spent $100 million on an ad campaign for its hepatitis C drug, Harvoni  the one that costs as much as $1,100 a pill.Americans are about evenly split on the educational value of prescription drug ads. But the American Medical Association recently called for a ban, arguing that TV drug ads merely drive demand for expensive treatments. Senator Al Franken, making the same argument as the A.M.A., has introduced a bill to withdraw tax breaks companies are permitted to take for their ad spending.Research on the consequences of drug ads presents a more nuanced picture. Advertising increases drug sales; the studies are consistent on that. It does so for the promoted drug, as one would expect. But it also increases sales of other, nonadvertised drugs for the same condition. For instance, Prozac ads lead to increases in prescriptions not only of Prozac, but also of Zoloft.  Bradley Shapiro, an economist at the University of Chicago, found that the increase in the overall antidepressant market is larger than the market share gains made by just the advertised drugs.Why would one drug benefit from anothers ads? For stigmatized conditions, like depression and other mental illnesses, drug ads may serve to normalize them, encouraging sufferers to seek treatment, even if its not with the specific advertised drug.Doctors appear to benefit from TV drug advertising. Only they, and certain types of assistants and nurses, prescribe drugs, so for advertising to increase their use, visits to physicians must increase. And thats what studies have found. One-third of adults said that drug advertising prompted a discussion with their physician. Collectively, every $28 spent by drug companies per year on ads resulted in one more visit to a doctor that led to a prescription. One more person making one more doctor visit doesnt sound like much, but drug companies spend billions on advertising.Interestingly, the A.M.A.s call for an advertising ban does not extend to promotion aimed at doctors. Yet the drug industry spends about seven times more on visits to doctors offices by drug company representatives, free samples and advertising in professional journals than on ads directed at consumers. Physicians may more readily prescribe drugs theyre familiar with through these types of promotion.Though doctors often may yield to patients requests for a specific drug, in many cases they apply their own judgment and prescribe a different one, or none at all. When it comes to depression, a randomized controlled trial showed that drug requests led to more appropriate care, though not always with pharmaceuticals. The study sent professional actors to doctors offices, where they pretended to have depression. Among those who did not request drugs, only 56 percent received appropriate care  any combination of an antidepressant prescription, a referral to a mental health professional or a follow-up appointment. Just one-quarter of the people requesting a specific drug received it; about half received no drug at all. But among those who requested a specific drug, 90 percent received appropriate care, but not all of it involved drugs.Another way drug ads can help patients is by encouraging them to continue with medication theyve already been prescribed. According to one study, for every 10 percent increase in viewership of drug ads, between 1 and 2.5 percent more people adhere to their prescribed drug regimen. Several studies of spending on ads for statin drugs found that it was associated with a greater proportion of high-cholesterol patients who successfully brought their cholesterol levels under control.A study of advertising of antidepressants found that it was associated with an increase in the number of people who received antidepressants for the appropriate duration of treatment.Whether drug ads influence prescribing varies by condition. Ads for conditions that are easily tested  like high cholesterol or allergies  are more likely to lead to appropriate prescribing because there is little uncertainty as to whether the patient has the indicated condition.One study showed that advertising leads to greater sales for drugs that insurance companies encourage via lower cost sharing. Another showed that advertising increases sales of lower-cost, nonadvertised drugs. Put it all together and the link between a drug ad and a patient obtaining that particular drug is weaker than many might think.Theres little consistent evidence that ads substantially promote higher drug prices. One study found that only about 6 percent of the entire increase in prescription drug spending growth between 1994 and 2005 could be attributed to advertising-driven price increases.Its unlikely that all uses of prescription drugs that ads encourage are beneficial. One study found that greater advertising led to more adverse reactions to drugs. So some people propose a compromise position on drug ads: allow them only for drugs that have been in use for several years, during which time safety can be more thoroughly assessed. Another way to approach the problem might be to promote use of effective drugs by reducing their prices or patients out-of-pocket costs for them.The evidence suggests that the A.M.A. is only partly right. Not all prescribing that drug ads promote is valuable, yet they encourage some helpful and appropriate care."}

(All times Eastern.)Flyers vs. AnyoneA month is left in the regular season, and the jockeying for playoff position will be in intense, particularly in the East. Philadelphia entered Tuesdays action 3 points out of a wild-card spot with 76 points, but three of its next four games are against the teams just above them. The Flyers host Detroit on Tuesday (7:30 p.m., NBCSN) and Pittsburgh on Saturday before visiting the Islanders on Monday.Capitals vs. Clinching PossibilitiesWashington isnt quite at the Golden State Warriors level, but the Capitals are on the verge of clinching a playoff spot with 14 games left. With 103 points in 68 games, Washington is 17 points better than the second-place team in the East (Boston) and 12 points ahead of Dallas and St. Louis in the Presidents Trophy race. The Capitals have several ways to earn a playoff berth Tuesday night, according to the N.H.L.:Kings at Stars, Tuesday, 8:30 p.m.Los Angeles faced a doozy of a doubleheader this week, visiting Chicago and Dallas on consecutive nights. The Kings passed the first test in style, shutting out the Blackhawks, 5-0. The Hawks have lost three in a row, allowing the Stars and the Blues to leapfrog them in the Central Division. Tuesdays matchup pits the N.H.L.s highest scoring team (Dallas, with 3.21 goals per game) against its stingiest (Los Angeles, with 2.24 goals against per game). With the Stars battling injuries and scoring droughts by Jamie Benn and Tyler Seguin, Jason Spezza has risen to the occasion, scoring in six straight games. Coach Lindy Ruff said this was the best Spezza has played since arriving in Dallas before last season.Rangers vs. CaliforniaWith Rick Nash back after a seven-week absence and Henrik Lundqvist healthy, the Rangers are at full strength for the first time since mid-January. But that hasnt solved their erratic play. The Rangers had three frustrating losses in the past week to Eastern teams they are battling for playoff position. Now they head out for a three-game swing against likely playoff teams in California, beginning Wednesday in Anaheim. On their last trip against top Western teams, the Rangers came away with statement victories over the Blues and the Stars, who are tied for the best record in the conference.N.C.A.A. Womens Frozen Four, Friday and SundayLed by Alex Carpenter, undefeated Boston College is trying to become the first team from New England to win the Division I womens hockey title. To do so, the Eagles will have to defeat two teams with champion pedigrees. In Fridays semifinals in Durham, N.H., Boston College faces Clarkson, the 2014 champion. In the other semifinal, the five-time champion Minnesota and the four-time champion Wisconsin play for the sixth time this season. Minnesota, which has won three of the last four titles, claimed two of the three games between the teams since Amanda Kessel returned from a two-year absence last month.The Boston Pride won the inaugural Isobel Cup, winning the National Womens Hockey League championship on Saturday against the Buffalo Beauts. Along for the ride was Denna Laing, who was paralyzed while playing for the Pride in an exhibition game at the Winter Classic in January. Her jersey hung behind the Pride bench, and she was part of the on-ice postgame celebration, where a hat with her number was placed on top of the trophy and her teammates talked to her through FaceTime.Pride players took the Isobel Cup to Laing the next day at the rehabilitation facility where she is staying, and she even took a drink from it.The Toronto Maple LeafsYes, the Toronto Maple Leafs. The rebuilding team has been shedding veteran contracts since the off-season, and after the trade deadline on Feb. 29, the Leafs went all in on their youth movement, meaning there are a lot of new faces to get to know. They called up some of their top prospects, including William Nylander, Nikita Soshnikov, Zach Hyman and Kasperi Kapanen. They added the young defenseman Connor Carrick in a trade and gave 22-year-old Garret Sparks the backup goalie job.Nylander, the son of the former N.H.L. player Michael Nylander, is the most touted of the bunch. The No. 8 overall pick in 2014, Nylander, 19, has two goals in eight games with the Leafs. (Fun fact: Brooks Laich assisted on Michael Nylanders last N.H.L. goal and on William Nylanders first N.H.L. goal.) Soshnikov, 22, and Hyman, 23, also have two goals since their call-ups.The team faces a decision in coming days on whether to keep some of the players beyond their 10th N.H.L. game, which would count as the first year on their entry-level contracts.With the worst record in the N.H.L., the Maple Leafs will almost certainly be part of the lottery for the No. 1 pick  another young face on a team now full of them."}

He wants Paige to escape their struggle; she wants to pass it on. They both see themselves in her, and the conflict is all the more excruciating because they may both be right.Elizabeth and Philip work for a ruthless dictatorship, of course, but knowing that the Soviet Union is a dying empire gives The Americans a tragic distance. Its Cold War is a sad war, a global struggle that grinds down the people forced into it.Theres the F.B.I. agent Stan Beeman (Noah Emmerich), the Jenningses friend and unwitting pursuer, whose marriage has fallen apart. Theres Stans erstwhile lover, Nina (Annet Mahendru), a K.G.B. office worker at the Soviet Embassy who is shipped back to Moscow after being used as a double agent and pawn. Most painfully, theres Martha (Alison Wright), an F.B.I. employee who believes Philip is Clark; he courted and married her for access to her office. Ms. Wright makes Marthas predicament into something out of a psychological horror movie.The Americans has created a crowded bulletin board of characters and subplots, and this new season struggles to pin the yarn to connect them all. But each resonates with the others, like movements in a melancholy symphony. This may be a Manichaean global struggle, but on the ground its just soul-weary spies versus jaded bureaucrats, like the F.B.I. agent who reads a memo chastising employees for using the verb feel in official communications. The bureau, he says mordantly, does not feel.The Americans is all about the connection between physical and metaphorical feeling. Even its violence is intimate, up close and personal: beating, strangling, point-blank shooting.Elizabeth and Philip may or may not be good people, but they are affected by each of these acts, and the shows drama makes their feelings palpable. In their world, in their family, its a fine line between a death grip and an embrace."}
{"text": "LOS ANGELES  Indy lives.Walt Disney Studios on Tuesday said that it would restart the Indiana Jones movie franchise, with Steven Spielberg again in the directors chair and Harrison Ford reprising the title role. The fifth film in the adventure series will arrive in theaters on July 19, 2019.In making the announcement, Alan F. Horn, Disneys film chairman, called Indiana Jones one of the greatest heroes in cinematic history. Details about the plot, casting or title were not made available.Disney gained rights to the whip-wielding archaeologist with its $4 billion acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012. Restarting that boutique studios Star Wars series was a priority. But Disney  noticing renewed moviegoer interest in movie properties from the 1980s and 1990s, with Universals monster hit Jurassic World as Exhibit A  has now turned its focus to a resuscitation of the Indiana Jones brand.Kathleen Kennedy, the president of Lucasfilm, will serve as a producer of the new Indiana Jones movie, along with her husband, Frank Marshall. George Lucas, who had writing and producing credits on the first four Indiana Jones movies, is not expected to be involved with the new one.Indy and his pals have taken in roughly $2 billion at the global box office since their arrival in 1981, sold billions of dollars in related merchandise, spawned rides at Disney theme parks and inspired spinoff TV series. But the last film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, which was released by Paramount in 2008, was considered a misfire by many fans, with one of Mr. Lucass ideas  having Mr. Ford hide in an old refrigerator during a nuclear blast  mocked mercilessly online."}
{"text": "From the first soft bite of blood sausage, I knew I would like Insa.Just seeing the word soondae on the menu of this new Korean restaurant had been enough to get my hopes up. Purplish links of coagulated pigs blood bound by rice and an arterial network of springy, skinny cellophane noodles, soondae does not tend to travel far from Korean neighborhoods. Insa sits between a moving company and a mechanics garage in an industrial patch of Brooklyn near the Gowanus Canal. The area is not crowded with Korean restaurants or, for that matter, Koreans.Soondae here? If nothing else, it suggested that Insa had plenty of confidence.I dragged one dark, purplish slice across a line of salt laced with ground chile and perilla seeds. The seared skin crackled between my teeth: the sign of an animal-gut casing. Blood sausage can sometimes be dry, but Insas soondae spilled with tender crumbs that were almost juicy, moistened with braised pigs snouts and ground belly meat. The noodles gave it a little bounce but didnt get in the way of the deep, galvanic taste of iron. It was wonderfully well made, and not quite like any soondae Id tasted on 32nd Street or on the kimchi belt along Northern Boulevard in Queens.Insa was opened before Christmas by Sohui Kim and her husband, Ben Schneider. He is the designer, woodworker, decorator of the themed karaoke rooms in back, and propmaster of the retro lounge thats dressed in David Lynch red. She is the chef.Mr. Schneider was raised in Manhattan. Ms. Kim moved from Seoul to the Bronx when she was 10. The couple also owns the Good Fork, about two miles away in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where the menu dips its toes into Korean cuisine. The one at Insa dives straight into it.Chefs trying to get American eaters to fall for another countrys cooking often toss essential flavors out the window. The restaurant crosses over, but the cuisine becomes roadkill. Insa is a rare crossover that limits most of its tweaks to externals. Traditional Korean recipes may be altered, in texture for instance (soondae is not usually pan-seared), but their spirit is largely left intact.For customers who did not grow up with Korean food, Insa puts extra clarity into the way the menu is written and explained by servers, most of whom are lavishly tattooed. Almost nothing on it qualifies as fusion, though. Even the seafood corn dog has antecedents in Seoul, although Insa hasnt yet copied the impressive Korean idea of incorporating French fries right into a corn dog.Officially, Insa is a barbecue restaurant. Gas burners are punched into the centers of the long mess-hall tables lined up between buffed wooden benches. The tables are about as wide across as a rowboat. This made conversation a challenge  one of my guests, who has a voice that could wake sleeping livestock, later said he wanted to borrow a karaoke microphone to make himself heard  but we needed the space when the rest of the food came.As soon as the blue flames jump up, little dishes (banchan) start to circle the ring. Good banchan signal seriousness in a Korean kitchen, and the ones at Insa are really flavorful, made with care: cabbage and daikon, pink with chile paste and fermented on site; chewy black beans in salty syrup; peanuts with silvery dried anchovies; chewy bands of cuttlefish with time-release flavor.Barbecue was rarely my favorite thing on the table, though. The very fresh-tasting squid and octopus grilled up beautifully, but I missed the scent of charcoal, and Insas gas flames seemed too low to give the marinated short rib strips or thinly shaved brisket the crisp edges I like. The dishes I look forward to eating again are those cooked in the open kitchen off to one side.Insas yuk hwe is one of the most suave versions of beef tartare any Korean restaurant has served me. The chopped eye of round is chilly and firm, crunchy with Asian pear and fried capers, and deliciously shiny with sesame oil. I would have lapped it up with a spoon, but it was, no doubt, better on gnarled curls of shrimp chips. Insas tteokbokki are terrific, too: pudgy little fingers of rice stick blackly seared on the bottom for crunch. They are tossed with tender ovals of seafood sausage and smacked with chile paste.The heat was not incinerating, but it was warm enough. At other times, Insa didnt supply the burn Ive come to love at other Korean restaurants. The bibimbap in particular seemed afraid of getting noticed.Spice doses can be recalibrated, though. What sets Insa apart is a modern chefs sensitivity to technique and ingredients. (The squid that are so good on the grill are just as welcome in the thick and unusually fluffy seafood pajeon.) The chef de cuisine, Michael Stokes, came up with the soondae, and the sous-chef, Yong Shin, is responsible for the seafood corn dog, a fine snack to eat at Insas tiki bar.There, no outrigger dangles from the ceiling, and an animated underwater video screen stands in for the tanks of live fish at torchlit palaces like the dearly departed Kahiki Supper Club in Columbus, Ohio. But the bartenders wear aloha shirts as they reach for coconut mugs and Fu Manchu cups for their modernized Polynesian drinks.A tiki bar! Exotica from Polynesia, a land so vaguely defined in the American imagination that it was able to encompass pia coladas, egg rolls and teriyaki chicken, clearly has no business in a serious modern Korean restaurant. But bastardized cocktails are preferable to bastardized cuisine.The cocktail menu looks interesting. To tell the truth, I never made it past the mai tai. The first one I tried was dominated by local almond milk syrup (orgeat cooked up in Red Hook from nonlocal nuts), but in my second, the lime juice was prominent, the way it should be. It wasnt a Trader Vics mai tai, but it was all right in its own way, I decided, as I finished my fourth.By that time, I was in the jungle room, clutching a microphone for dear life as if that would be enough to give me the extra octaves I needed for Blue Bayou. I hadnt meant to sing. But one of the servers had opened the door on a room swaddled in orchids and tropical leaves and artificial turf. Then somebody keyed a Dolly Parton number into the karaoke machine. Theres also a deep-sea room, a space room and a psychedelic room, the server said, discreetly closing the door.Id like to describe all the others. To tell the truth, I never made it past the jungle room."}

{"text": "It might be a while before we know conclusively who won the presidential primaries in Missouri.On Tuesday night, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton both appeared to score the narrowest of victories in the Show-Me State, but under the states elections laws, the vote totals will not be official for roughly a month. Still to be counted are an unknown number of overseas absentee and military ballots as well as provisional ballots, which are offered to voters who are not listed on precinct registers or when their registration records cannot be found.Even then, the margins are likely to be tight enough that the runners-up in both contests, Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders, could seek recounts, a process that could take three more weeks. State law allows a candidate to request a recount if the margin of victory is less than one-half of 1 percent, which was true in both races. As it stands, Mr. Trump leads Mr. Cruz by 1,726 votes and Mrs. Clinton is ahead of Mr. Sanders by 1,531, according to the Missouri secretary of states office.A triumph in Missouri would be a psychological victory for the campaigns that come out on top, but it also has significance in the delegate count, particularly in the Republican race, where 52 delegates are at stake.Twelve of those go to the statewide winner. Five go to the winner of each of the states eight Congressional Districts. As the votes stood Wednesday, Mr. Trump would win five of the eight Missouri districts, with Mr. Cruz winning the other three, giving Mr. Trump 37 delegates to Mr. Cruzs 15.But several of those district victories were by very narrow margins  including one Trump win by roughly 100 votes  so those results could change.Any change on the Democratic side would most likely be minor, since the party awards delegates proportionate to the statewide vote.Missouri has a recent history with a statewide recount. In 2014, the vote approving a constitutional amendment allowing for the right to farm, a measure promoted as a bulwark against the overregulation of agricultural practices, and opposed by environmental groups and the Humane Society, was so close that a recount was requested, which affirmed the vote.Mr. Cruz also has a recount history. In 2000, he worked on the legal team for George W. Bush during his Florida recount fight with Al Gore."}
{"text": "On Feb. 29, Carol Greider of Johns Hopkins University became the third Nobel Prize laureate biologist in a month to do something long considered taboo among biomedical researchers: She posted a report of her recent discoveries to a publicly accessible website, bioRxiv, before submitting it to a scholarly journal to review for official publication.It was a small act of information age defiance, and perhaps also a bit of a throwback, somewhat analogous to Stephen Kings 2000 self-publishing an e-book or Radioheads 2007 release of a download-only record without a label. To commemorate it, she tweeted the websites confirmation under the hashtag #ASAPbio, a newly coined rallying cry of a cadre of biologists who say they want to speed science by making a key change in the way it is published.Such postings are known as preprints to signify their early-stage status, and the 2,048 deposited on three-year-old bioRxiv over the last year represent a barely detectable fraction of the million or so research papers published annually in traditional biomedical journals.But after several dozen biologists vowed to rally around preprints at an ASAPbio meeting last month, the site has had a small surge, and not just from scientists whose august stature protects them from risk. On Twitter, preprint insurgents are celebrating one anothers postings and jockeying for revolutionary credibility. (These two are from a molecular biologist at the University of California, Berkeley and a Cold Spring Harbor neuroscientist.)For most of the history of organized scientific research, the limitations of technology made print journals the chief means of disseminating scientific results. But some #ASAPbio advocates argue that since the rise of the Internet, biologists have been abdicating their duty to the public  which pays for most academic research  by not sharing results as quickly and openly as possible. As Harold Varmus, another Nobel Prize recipient and former director of the National Institutes of Health put it in a widely tweeted talk at the conference:Unlike physicists, for whom preprints became a default method of communicating discoveries in the 1990s, biomedical researchers typically wait more than six months to disseminate their work while they submit it  on an exclusive basis  to the most prestigious journal they think might accept it for publication. If, as is often the case, it is rejected, they try another journal. As a result, it can sometimes take years to publish a paper, which is then typically available for a time only to colleagues at major academic institutions whose libraries pay for subscriptions. And because science is in many ways a relay, with one scientist building on the published work of another, the communication delays almost certainly slow scientific progress.Researchers say they participate in the process in large part because the imprimatur of highly selective journals like Science, Nature and Cell has come to be viewed as a proxy for quality science. Like a degree from certain colleges, a study in an elite journal can be a passport to jobs, funding and promotions.While several influential journals, including Science and Nature, have a stated policy of treating preprints on an equal footing with papers that have not been posted elsewhere, few biologists have chosen an option they fear will handicap already slim prospects of acceptance. Some journals have a policy of not considering preprints. And others, like Cell, say prospective authors who wish to post preprints must ask first.Anne Carpenter, a computational biologist affiliated with the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard said that she thinks that many young scientists prefer sticking with high-profile journals because the alternative just seems to too risky.Beyond career concerns, many scientists say science as a whole benefits from the kind of peer review that has been a fixture of scientific publishing, in which journal editors ask other scientists in a field to flag obvious errors and assess the importance of a work before publication. Yet another Nobel Prize laureate, Randy Schekman, a cell biologist at the University of California, Berkeley, has argued for its importance even while supporting preprints.But many biologists have begun to chafe at a system that one neuroscientist recently compared to a bug on its back trying to flip itself over while endlessly rotating a piece of what appears to be Styrofoam.The delays prevent scientists from showing off their most recent work to prospective employers or benefactors. They have also, some researchers say, begun to look faintly absurd against the general expectations for speed and openness in the not-so-new digital age. With the rapid spread of the Zika virus, for instance, several journals signed a statement promising that scientists would not be penalized for immediately releasing their findings, given the potential benefit for public health, in turn prompting some scientists to ask, why draw the line at Zika?Then there is the researcher in Kazakhstan who has become a kind of science cult hero by pirating every academic paper for which journals require payment and making them available on a free site called Sci-Hub. Though few think that is a long-term solution, one website has called her the Robin Hood of Science.And many #ASAPbio supporters retweeted John Hawks, a paleoanthropologist from the University of Wisconsin, who found himself recently at an African university where a paper on African genomes was unavailable because it could not pay the fee for the journal where it was published, and no preprint was available. He expressed his frustration with a profanity.In such contexts, the observation of Richard Sever, who runs the bioRxiv server at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, considered the best known place to post biology preprints, becomes harder to ignore, researchers say.Some journal editors say that preprints would be detrimental to science. Emilie Marcus, the editor of Cell, told scientists at the #ASAPbio conference that in conversations with more than 100 scientists Cell editors had found that the main reason they wanted to use preprints was to scoop competitors, which she suggested would cause the quality of papers to decline as everyone rushed to post first: Is that the direction that we want to go? Others have argued on Twitter that allowing research to reach the public without being reviewed before publication would be irresponsible.Preprint advocates counter that scientists care too much about their reputations to publish shoddy work, and posts to bioRxiv are clearly marked to indicate that they may contain information that has not yet been accepted or endorsed in any way by the scientific or medical community. Others note that plenty of peer-reviewed papers in high-profile journals have proved to be wrong, and some argue that carrying out peer review after a paper is published would provide a more rigorous and fair vetting of papers, anyway.Unlike some writers and artists who have used digital media to escape entirely from middlemen, most biologists tweeting with #ASAPbio want to maintain a relationship with traditional journals. Many have taken pains to reiterate their wish not to disrupt the journal system, only to enhance it. With enough scientists pushing to legitimize preprints, they hope journals will allow the systems to coexist.Its not beer or tacos, as James Fraser, an assistant professor at the University of California, San Francisco put it at last months conference, its beer AND tacos.But others, including the dean of Harvard Medical School, Jeffrey S. Flier, say disrupting journals could be a good thing for science.In any case, some researchers say, a dtente between journals and preprint advocates may be short-lived. If university libraries drop their costly journal subscriptions in favor of free preprints, journals may well withdraw permission to use them, forcing biomedical researchers to make a harder choice. The preprint movement, some #ASAPbio advocates argue, may presage the need for a greater cultural shift than scientists have not yet been willing to make: evaluating one another based on the substance of their papers, not where they are published. But it does, Michael Eisen, a longtime advocate for scientific publishing reform at the University of California, Berkeley, told his colleagues, help move this area of scientific publishing into the 20th century."}

{"text": "During a recent outbreak of the Zika virus in French Polynesia, roughly one in 100 women infected in the first trimester of pregnancy developed a fetus with an abnormally small head and brain damage, researchers reported on Tuesday.The study is among the first to reliably estimate the rate of this birth defect, called microcephaly, in a population widely infected with Zika.The research, published in The Lancet, provides some reassurance that the complication is rare, experts said.It means you have a 99 percent chance of having a normal baby, said Dr. Laura C. Rodrigues, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying the report.By comparison, the risk of congenital rubella syndrome  which may include heart disease, hearing loss and developmental delays in infants  ranges from 38 percent to 100 percent when mothers are infected in the first trimester.But because the Zika virus is carried largely by mosquitoes, it can infect broad sections of a population. If you apply a 1 percent risk to a large number of women, its still a large public health problem, said Simon Cauchemez, the studys lead author and the director of mathematical modeling for the infectious diseases unit at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. In French Polynesia, 66 percent were infected.French Polynesia has a population of roughly 270,000 and just one prenatal diagnosis center. I really believe they picked up every event that occurred, said Dr. David O. Freedman, professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. You cant do studies like this in Brazil.Dr. Cauchemez and his colleagues scoured medical records to find cases of microcephaly in French Polynesia and estimated the proportion of people infected with the Zika virus by using data from previous studies that looked for antibodies in blood.The researchers established that the baseline prevalence of microcephaly in the territory was two cases per 10,000 newborns. Between September 2013 and July 2015, before and after the outbreak of Zika virus, there were eight cases of microcephaly.Seven cases occurred around the end of the epidemic. Such temporal clustering strongly supports the proposed association between infection with the virus and microcephaly, Dr. Cauchemez and his colleagues wrote.However, the researchers do not know if the mothers of the microcephalic fetuses were infected with the virus, because they were not tested for this study. Three of the microcephalic fetuses were carried to term. Five pregnancies were terminated between 26 and 31 weeks of gestation.Dr. Freedman cautioned that the 1 percent absolute risk may not apply in other countries where Zika is spreading. Recent research suggests that the virus may be associated with other serious complications. This month, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine found 29 percent of Brazilian women who had ultrasound exams after testing positive for Zika infections had fetuses with abnormally small heads or placentas and nerve damage."}
{"text": "RIO DE JANEIRO   Will Brazils besieged former president avoid going to prison by joining the government of his protg, President Dilma Rousseff, as a cabinet minister with unrivaled influence?The country is riveted by the prospect of Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, the former president, returning to government in a position that would put him at the side of his successor and protect him from an expanding inquiry into allegations of graft and money laundering.Were Mr. da Silva to join Ms. Rousseffs cabinet, he would be granted special judicial standing enjoyed by about 700 senior political figures in Brazil, including cabinet members and all 594 members of Congress.Officials with special standing can be tried only in Brazils highest court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal. Effectively, this means that the trials of senior officials drag on at the court for years, with few ever going to prison. Pressure on both presidents is growing, as Mr. da Silva faces a request for his arrest in a graft inquiry and Ms. Rousseff faces impeachment proceedings related to her use of funds from state banks to cover budget gaps.On Tuesday, the Supreme Federal Tribunal accepted a plea deal in which a senator from the presidents Workers Party claimed that Mr. da Silva and Ms. Rousseff each tried to obstruct corruption investigations.In taking the deal, Senator Delcdio do Amaral accused one of Ms. Rousseffs top aides of offering him financial assistance to not testify about corruption in the government.The prospect of Mr. da Silva returning to government produced wide swings in Brazils financial markets on Tuesday, with the main index of the So Paulo stock exchange plunging 3.6 percent and the currency, the real, falling sharply against the dollar.Marco Aurlio Mello, a justice on the high court, sought to respond to concerns that Mr. da Silva could avoid going to prison by joining Ms. Rousseffs cabinet. The Supreme Federal Tribunal would not be benevolent to the former president, the justice said.Momentum for Mr. da Silva to join his protgs administration has been building in recent days as federal and state prosecutors target him on claims of money laundering and graft in their investigations into the dealings of giant Brazilian construction companies.Mr. da Silva, who served as president from 2003 to 2010, remains the most important figure in the Workers Party. The prospect of his arrest dealt a blow to Ms. Rousseff, who was already grappling with dismal approval ratings, a severe economic downturn and protests calling for her to resign.Ms. Rousseff said last week that she would be extremely proud to have Mr. da Silva in her cabinet.His potential return has already invigorated supporters of the scandal-plagued Workers Party.While some analysts contend that Ms. Rousseff would become little more than a ceremonial leader if Mr. da Silva takes a cabinet post, some party leaders say that his return could bolster an administration struggling with what they describe as orchestrated attempts to remove it from power.Lula is a leader wherever he is, Maria do Rosrio Nunes, a Workers Party legislator and former cabinet minister, said on Twitter. If he decides to become a minister, it will be to energetically confront this crisis and dismantle daily coup plotting.Critics of the government suggest the move has another motive: shielding Mr. da Silva from the possibility of going to prison.About 200 legislators, or a third of Brazils Congress, face charges before the Supreme Federal Tribunal. They include the speaker of the lower house, Eduardo Cunha, who has avoided calls to step down despite being embroiled in a graft scandal around Petrobras, the national oil company.This move is indicative of the disregard Lula has for Brazils legal system, said Merval Pereira, a prominent political commentator, in a column in the newspaper O Globo. He could sink the country to save his own skin if he takes control of the government and implements populist measures to recover popularity.Mr. da Silva has confounded critics before. After his election as president more than a decade ago, he embraced market-friendly policies, resulting in an economic boom that made him one of the most popular leaders in Brazilian history.Yet a string of corruption scandals have eroded that popularity. Mr. do Amaral, who was the Workers Partys leader in the Senate and who was arrested on corruption charges last November, testified that the education minister in Ms. Rousseffs government tried to prevent him from talking to investigators.Mr. do Amaral said that same minister, Aloizio Mercadante, offered to persuade a justice on the Supreme Federal Tribunal to get Mr. do Amaral released.Mr. do Amaral also told investigators that Mr. da Silva arranged illegal payments to a businessman convicted of operating a vote-buying scheme during his time in office.The plea deal also casts doubt about Ms. Rousseffs role the Petrobras investigation. Mr. do Amaral claimed that Ms. Rousseff maneuvered to have a judge nominated to one of Brazils highest courts in an attempt to release jailed executives."}

How about seared lamb chops, mashed mint peas (pick up the recipe at step 6) and an Orangemans colcannon?Meanwhile, over in the Food section we dropped on porches across the nation this morning, were thrilling to Melissa Clarks ace new egg-centric recipes: a chocolate pavlova; some Portuguese egg tarts; and a beautiful angel food cake with lemon curd. Theres a weekend project in there for all of us, no?(That is, if we dont catch a cheap flight down to Pittsburgh, where Jeff Gordinier was recently to report out his terrific article  on how food is helping to lead the citys comeback!)For dinner tonight, perhaps you could join us in our Wednesday tradition, and cook without a proper recipe, relying instead on the story of a meal? This weeks is about salmon, which, no matter its heritage, you can cook to crispness in a big, oil-sheened pan. Melt a little brown sugar into the pan juices when its cooked through and hit that mixture with a few splashes of fish sauce and an absolute riot of black pepper. Pour the sauce over the fish and scatter a handful of torn mint leaves on top. Serve it with rice. It could be your midweek recipe for the next six weeks.If following sheet music is more your game, thats O.K. as well. Thats what Mark Bittmans recipe for shrimp in green sauce is for.

Haley of South Carolina threw her support to Ted Cruz on Wednesday, calling him solid and strong.In contrast to the splashy endorsement of Mr. Rubio before her states primary last month, Ms. Haley delivered the news almost off-hand as she took questions from reporters in Columbia, S.C, the state capital.My hope and my prayer is that Senator Cruz can pull through this and that he can push through and really get to where he needs to go, Ms. Haley said. Because we do want a strong leader, we do want somebody thats conservative, we do want somebody thats action-minded. So well see what happens.She said there were no further plans for an endorsement announcement with more fanfare for Mr. Cruz, the Texas senator.I dont know that I need to formally endorse, she said.

{"text": "In the movie Machete, theres a scene in which Danny Trejo rips out an opponents intestines and, leaping from a window, uses them like rope to rappel down the side of a building. As action scenes go, this one has extra habanero.In his new novel, I Hate the Internet, Jarett Kobek performs a similar maneuver on the viscera of the American psyche, at least as regards the so-called information highway. I cant decide if, on his way down, Mr. Kobek is laughing or weeping.Dont be put off by this books feeble title. I Hate the Internet isnt a book about, I dont know, why your selfies always make you look dumpy. Instead its a grainy political and cultural rant, a sustained shriek about power and morality in a new global era. Its a glimpse at a lively mind at full boil.Nothing says individuality, Mr. Kobek comments about a generations laptops and cellphones, like 500 million consumer electronics built by slaves. Welcome to hell. Hes just getting tuned up.Mr. Kobek is a Turkish-American writer who lives in California. His first novel, Atta (2011), was a fictionalized biography of the Sept. 11 hijacker-pilot Mohamed Atta.His new novel is ostensibly the story of a middle-aged comic-book writer named Adeline. She lives in San Francisco and mourns its gentrification at the hands of venture capitalists and tech start-ups. The citys misfits, of whom she is one, are being pushed out.The story begins as Adeline commits the only unforgivable sin of the 21st century. That is, invited to give a lecture, she neglects to notice that someone is recording her. Adeline has other problems, Mr. Kobek suggests: (1) She was a woman in a culture that hated women. (2) Shed become kind of famous. (3) Shed expressed unpopular opinions.Some of these opinions, which become infamous on YouTube, are on why women should be leery of working for tech companies. All these crazy young ones are lining up to burn in their very own Shirtwaist Factories, screaming that theyre empowered by the very technology thats set them aflame, Adeline says, in her goofy trans-Atlantic accent, which makes her sound like a drugged out Diana Vreeland.Some of these opinions are complaints about the fantasies of fame and power in the songs, videos and social media of todays pop stars. A wide range of humanity believed that Beyonc and Rihanna were inspirations rather than vultures, we read. Adeline had spit on their gods. Adeline barely knows what Twitter is. Attack Bey and RiRi? Shes about to find out about its self-righteous side.Adelines story sits alongside that of a younger woman, Ellen, whose life is destroyed after an old boyfriends pictures of her, taken during sex, are splashed across the web. Each of these women, in Mr. Kobeks hands, is interesting and sympathetic. But I Hate the Internet is fundamentally a platform for the authors slashing social criticism.Theres a bit of the French writer Michel Houellebecq in Mr. Kobeks profane satire. Theres a bit of Thomas Piketty in his obsession with economic inequality. Theres a bit of the Ambrose Bierce of The Devils Dictionary in his ability to take words and ideas and invest them with uglier and thus usually more accurate meanings.New definitions? Comics, here, are subtle pornography for the mentally backward. Comic-book conventions are an excuse for people to dress up like the intellectual properties of major corporations. Money is the unit by which people measured humiliation. What would you do for a dollar?Amazon: an unprofitable website dedicated to the destruction of the publishing industry. Instagram: the first social media platform to which the only sane reaction was hate. Then theres this about George W. Bushs paintings: Like peering into the shattered mind of a suicidal beagle thats lost depth perspective.This is a shaggy and quite entertaining novel of ideas. The two most prominent of these are: Why are humans so eager, on sites like Twitter and Facebook, to give away their intellectual property to wealthy white men? And: What has happened to political activism? Do people think typing 140-character morality lectures is pushing society forward?One of the curious aspects of the 21st century was the great delusion amongst many people, particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, that freedom of speech and freedom of expression were best exercised on technology platforms owned by corporations dedicated to making as much money as possible, Mr. Kobek writes.A majority of these tweeted opinions, he notes, are smug and hypocritical when not utterly inane. Take Twitter and racism, which brings out the worst in almost everyone. Expressing concern about racism was a new religion, Mr. Kobek writes, and focusing on language rather than political mechanics was an effortless, and meaningless, way of making sure one was seen in a front-row pew of the new church.Like all jeremiads, I Hate the Internet is far better at posing questions than formulating answers. You will sometimes wish that a woman, or an African-American, had composed these acid observations about feminism and race.At times the author loses his focus; at other times you will sense a bit of halitotic spittle striking your chin. Yet this book has soul as well as nerve. It suggests that, as the author writes, the whole world was on a script of loss, and people only received their pages moments before they read their lines.My advice? Log off Twitter for a day. Pick this up instead."}

{"text": "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are conducting a sweeping investigation of environmental health and safety conditions, including cases of elevated blood lead levels, in public housing and homeless shelters and the possibility that the New York City housing and homeless agencies filed false claims to federal housing officials for payment related to the conditions.The investigation was disclosed on Wednesday in a letter from the office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, and in a judges subsequent order, which were both filed in federal court.The order, from Judge Deborah A. Batts, compels the citys Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to produce information about the cases of elevated blood lead levels among residents and complaints of unsafe, unsanitary or unhealthful conditions in public housing and homeless shelters.The documents said the health agency, in response to an earlier civil investigative demand from the prosecutors, had declined to provide the information without a judges order, to avoid violating the city and state health codes.Nick Paolucci, a spokesman for the citys Law Department, said late Wednesday that the health department was cooperating with the investigation.The Housing Authority, known as Nycha, has been struggling with deteriorating conditions in its aging complexes and is already under the supervision of a court-appointed special master to address issues of mold among the 178,000 apartments it manages.The agency has blamed a lack of money to address maintenance needs and major capital projects because of deep cuts in federal funding over more than a decade.But the court documents noted that Nycha is required to comply with federal requirements regarding lead-based paint and to maintain public housing so that it is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair. The investigative demand said the investigation concerns possible false claims submitted by the city to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which is a major source of funds for the Housing Authority.The prosecutors initial demand for documents, dated Nov. 20, sought the addresses of all buildings of the Housing Authority and the Department of Homeless Services where people with elevated blood lead levels had been identified; the date when those peoples elevated blood lead levels were identified; the date of any environmental investigation; the date the results of any such investigation were sent to the agencies; and the date the property in question was cleared, if lead hazard control was required by local law.Prosecutors also sought any notification letters and lead-based-paint evaluation results regarding the relevant people, properties and incidents. They also sought documents reflecting complaints about health conditions in public housing and homeless shelters, including those about leaks, water damage, mold, particulate matter peeling paint in pre-1978 buildings, lead paint, rodents or insects, and all documents reflecting any response to, investigation of or evaluation of such complaints by any city or state official or agency.The initial demand also sought all communications between the citys health, homeless and housing agencies, or any city, state or federal agency, about problematic health conditions in city public housing or homeless shelters. Prosecutors also sought documents reflecting any city or state analysis of the health effects of lead, mold, particulate matter, rodents or insects on residents of city public housing or homeless shelters.Asked about the investigation on Wednesday night, during an appearance at a panel discussion at Cooper Union titled The Next 100 Years of Affordable Housing, the Housing Authority chairwoman and chief executive, Shola Olatoye, said she had no comment. Referring to herself and Mayor Bill de Blasio, she said, What we all care about is having a safe and healthy community.The public housing stock of red brick towers dates as far back as the 1930s and 1940s  with many still likely to contain lead paint  and the agency has struggled to keep up with a backlog of work orders, including for lead paint removal.This month, State Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Democrat who represents parts of the Bronx and Westchester County, and Ritchie Torres, a Democrat from the Bronx who is chairman of the City Councils Public Housing Committee, released the results of a door-to-door survey their offices conducted among more than 200 Nycha residents, with 63 percent of those surveyed reporting something damaged or broken in their unit.The officials said staff members took pictures in common areas of egregious violations, like electrical wiring, mold and peeling paint.Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, has committed $300 million over three years for roof repairs, which officials said would help deal with the root cause of mold and excessive moisture.Mr. Torres said he was surprised by the inquiry into possible false claims, but not by the concerns about health, given what he said was the agencys dubious record addressing hazards.He said the agency was both poorly funded and poorly managed and should be doing better with the funds it gets.When youre under investigation by Preet Bharara, Mr. Torres said, thats as serious as it gets."}

On Wednesday he released a bizarre Instagram ad that depicts her, well, barking. Whatever. By now many Americans are realizing that when it comes to making strange noises, Mr. Trump is Best in Show. As proof, heres his barkin mad Super Duper Tuesday victory speechin Palm Beach, Fla., uncut and uncensored.Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much everybody. This was an amazing evening, this was a great evening. They just announced North Carolina.I dont know if theyve announced Illinois yet, but were leading by a lot so I think theyre gonna announce it. Ah, Florida was so amazing.And I want to thank our friends, Northern Marianas Islands have been so incredible. And we picked up nine delegates this morning. I heard very early in the morning, nine delegates, thats a lot. And I just wanted to thank the governor, Ralph Torres, great guy, Chairman Ada, who is a fantastic man. That was a very nice start to the day, that I can tell you.Many things have been happening over the last short period of time. CNN was very nice, they came up with a poll, the poll said 49 percent to 14 and 15. We just had one fromThe Economist, just came out, 53 percent. And its sort of interesting because I was watching the news a little while ago, and one of the commentatorswho Im not particularly fond of, but these are minor detailssaid, but Donald Trump doesnt get over 50 percent. Because Im at 43, 45. Actually now, according to theThe EconomistIm at 53. And I have to explain to these people, they dont understand basic physics, basic mathematics, basic whatever you want to call it. When I dont get over 50we have four people, right? We have four people, do you understand that? So when I get 53 in this one, as an example, I had 53, and thats with four people. Thats an amazing achievement just mathematically when you can get over 50 percent, so someday.Someday theyre gonna understand. Someday when wewhen wewhen we take it all theyll understand but it is really ridiculous.I want to thank my family. My boy Eric, and Don, theyve been working so hard.Ivanka and Jared have been amazing. Ivanka is home right now. In about two minutes Ill call and shes about ready to have a baby. So I dont knowsort of thing. Weve been thinking about that now for a little while. But Ivankas been so helpful and Jared has been amazing and its been just great. I want to thank Barron for putting up with the fact that I never see him anymore. And I want to thank Barron, I never see my Barron, and its his birthday on Sunday, so were very happy about that. So its a little tough, you know, when youre going away, and.He goes, when are you going to be come home, Daddy, when are you coming home. I said, well in about two and a half weeks, its pretty tough.Youre traveling all over the place, its really amazing. Yesterday I went up to Ohio, I went up to Youngstown. We had an incredible crowd and just amazing people in this country. We have so so many great people. We will, someday, in the not too distant futureif I win, otherwise its not gonna happen, I have to be honest with youbut Apple and all of these great companies will be making their product in the United States, not in China, Vietnam, and all of them.And were not going to be losing our companies. You know, our companies are leaving our country rapidly. Rapidly. Whether its Carrier Air Conditioning, whether its Ford, whether its Eaton. I was in Cleveland and Eaton Corp., theyre leaving. And so many companies are leaving. And frankly Im disgusted with it. And Im tired of seeing it. And theres no reason for it. Its just gross incompetence at the highest level. We should not allow it to happen. Pfizer, great company, pharmaceutical company, theyre going to Ireland. And theres so many more. You have corporate inversions. You have people cant get their money back into the country because the politicians cant get along, they cant make a deal. Everybody agrees, Democrat and Republican. Everybody agrees the money should come back. Theres two and a half trillion dollars outside of this country. Everybody agrees that the money should be here, and the politicians for three years havent been able to make a deal.And we could make a deal. Theres an example of something that you could do. If I sat down with a few of the senators and a few of the congressmen, you could make a deal on that in ten minutes if you knew what youre doing, because everybody wants to do it. And companies are actually leaving our country to get their money. Not only because our taxes are too highwhich were gonna lower, by the waybut companies are leaving our country in order to go and get money thats their money, because theres no way of bringing it in. So weve got aweve got a long way to go. But I think at some point its gonna get done.This has been very exciting, this whole process. We started, I was one of 17 people, senators, governors, Ive had such great support. Dr. Ben Carson the other day endorsed us.Great guy. Great guy. Wonderful man. And Chris Christie endorsed us, that was so incredible. And today Pam Bondi came up and endorsed us, she was great, andshe is a truly wonderful, a truly wonderful woman and the job shes done in Florida is incredible. You know, so manyweve had such incredible support. Paul Ryan called me the other day, tremendous call. I spoke with Mitch McConnell today. We had a great conversation. The fact is, we have to bring our party together. We have to bring it together. We haveWe have something happening that actually makes the Republican Party, probably the biggest political story anywhere in the world. Everybodys writing about it, all over Europe, all over the world theyre talking about it. Millions of people are coming in to vote. This was an example of it today. Many many more people. Im looking at the polling booths, Im looking at different polling booths all around the country, where its up. And the lines are four, five, six blocks long. And the woman, one woman was in there for 40 years, shes been working the polls. And she said, wed have two people here, wed have three people. Now look at the line. And the line looked like it was, you know, long. It was really long. Five deep, and long. And its just a different thing. We have a great opportunity. And the people that are voting are, Democrats are coming in, Independents are coming in, and very very importantly, people that never voted before. Its an incredible thing.I want to pay my respects, by the way, to Todd Palin, Sarahs husband. Sarah was here, she was incredible. She was making a speech on my behalf, and fantastic, everybody loves her. And what happened was he was in a very bad accident. Hes tough as nails, hes gonna be fine. But I just want to pay my respects, by the way, to Todd and Sarah.So, our theme when we startedand Melania and I came downYeah, sit down everybody, please. I mean, this is Mar-a-Lago, we give you seats, you dont have to stand.Im looking at all these people.Corey, good job, Corey. Good job. And Hope and our wholeour whole squad, right? So when this began, Melania and Iand I said, gotta do it, and she was so supportive and shes been so supportive, its been amazing. And we have to do it. We came down the escalator, and it was about trade and it was about borders. And what happened is, pretty quickly after that, and we werewe shot right up. I shot right to the top of the polls, and have been leading in the polls almost from the beginning, without fail. We went up in June. Most people said Ill never run, hes just gonna have fun, hes having a good time. This isnt necessarilyI mean, Im having a good time. I wouldyou know, Im having a very nice time, but you know what? Im working very hard. And there is great anger, believe me, there is great anger.One of the broadcasters was saying, is there anger? And I said to him, now see Im supposed to say no, theres not, we love the way things are working, we love the deal you made with Iran, its wonderful, you give them $150 billion, we get nothing, we love all the deals, the trade deals are wonderful, you lose $500 billion a year with China, we lost $58 billion a year in terms ofin terms of imbalance. Its a total imbalance. We dont make good deals anymore, we dont win anymore. As a country, we dont win anymore. And they asked, is there anger from your people, there seem to beAnd I said, there is anger. Theyre not angry people. But they want to see the country properly run. They want to see borders, they want to see good healthcare, they want to see things properly taken care of. They want our military rebuilt, our military is in a very bad state. They want it rebuilt.Very very importantlyAnd they want the Second Amendment, by the way, protected and protected strongly. And thats going to happen. And you know what they want so badly? They want our veterans taken care of. Our veterans are treated so badly.So we started, and something happened called Paris. Paris happened, and Paris was a disaster, that wasthereve been many disasters, but it was Paris. And then we had a case in Los Angeles whereit was in California where 14 young people were killed. And it just goes on and on and on. And what happened with me is this whole run took on a whole new meaning. Not just borders, not just good trade dealsand were gonna make the best trade deals youve ever seen, weve got such endorsements from Carl Icahn and the smartest people in business. And these people are going to be negotiating our deals, and theyre the best in the world, we have the best business people in the world. Theyre gonna knowWere gonna have such great deals. Were gonna do so good with trade. Were gonna do so good on the border. But it took on a whole new meaning. And the meaning was very simple. We need protection in our country. And thats gonna happen. And all of a sudden the poll numbers shot up.And Im just very proud to be a part of this. I think were going to go and were gonna do a lot of trips over the next month. But I think were gonna have a great victory. And I think, more importantly than anything else, were going to start winning again. This country is going to start winning again. We dont win anymore.We dont win with our military, we cant beat ISIS. Were gonna knock the hell out of them. We dont winWe dont win at trade, China, everybody, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam, India, name the country, anybody we dealanybody we do business with beats us. We dont win at trade. Were gonna win at trade. Were gonna make our country rich again. Were gonna make our country great again. And we need the rich in order to make the great, Im sorry to tell you.SoSo Im going forward. We had a fantastic evening. I would have never thought this could happen. I guess were waiting for one result, which possibly will be very successful, soBut to win the states that we won and to win by the margins, and especiallylook, this is my second home, Florida. To win by that kind of a number isis incredible. Its record-setting.Andand I have toAnd I have to say it, I have to say it that, number one, I want to congratulate Marco Rubio on having run a really tough campaign. Hes tough, hes smart, and hes got a great future, hes got a great future.But I have to sayand nobody has ever ever, in the history of politics, received the kind of negative advertising that I have. Record, record, record. Itby the way, mostly false. I wouldnt say 100 percent, but about 90 percent.Mostly false, vicious, horrible. They say it was 18 million the first week, meaning last week, and 25 million and it added up to over $40 million. And you explain it to me because I cant. My numbers went up. I dont understand it. Nobody understands it. My numbers went up.I mean its been an interesting experience. Last week, Adam Scott won at Trump National Doral, won the big tournament, the world championship of golf. And Adam, whos a great guy, I guess a lot of you folks saw that. But Im watching, and we have television screens all over and were down at this gorgeous green at Doral, and everything is working beautifully. And then a commercial comes on, the worst commercial. And Im with these wonderful people from Cadillac and all these top executives. And Im saying, look over there, look, dont watch it, no dontyou dont want to watch it. Im saying, dontarentisnt the grass beautiful? Look. Look, dont watch.And they came in waves, one after another after another. And it was brutal. And then Adam comes and hes this handsome kid from Australia, one of the greatest golfers in the world, made an unbelievable shot on the 18th hole to win the tournament, and hes a great champion. And were giving the award. And just beforewe break for a commercial, well be right back with our great champion from Australia, Adam Scott. And heres the commercial and I said NO and it was, two of them. Two of them. Oh what a day that was, what a disaster. What a disaster.Unbelievable.So again I just want to congratulate everybody. This is a really interesting process. Its an amazing process. Its very tough, but it is aby the end, if you get to the end, you can handle a lot of things, including pressure, that I can tell you, because theres nothing like it. Lies, deceit, viciousness, disgusting reporters, horrible people.Sure. Some are nice. Some are nice. Somesome really disgusting people back there laughed at that.And I just want to say, were gonna go forward. And were gonna win. But more importantly were gonna win for the country. Were gonna win, win, win, and were not stopping. Were gonna have great victories for our country. Thank you very much everybody. Thank you. Thank you."}
{"text": "Perhaps trying to burnish his legacy on financial reform, President Obama has recently trumpeted his signature steps to transform Wall Street in the years since the financial crisis that confronted him as he began his term eight years ago.But there are reasons to doubt that his efforts will have the profound effect he hopes they will.After a March 7 meeting at the White House with the top Wall Street regulators, including Janet L. Yellen, the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Obama praised the Dodd-Frank reform law, the Volcker Rule that seeks to prevent proprietary trading and the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is intended to make the world as safe from bad mortgages as it is from bad toasters.I want to emphasize this because it is popular in the media, in political discourse  both on the left and the right  to suggest that the crisis happened and nothing changed, he said sternly.That is not true. Let me repeat that. In fact, we went at financial regulation very hard to guard against another era of too big to fail and some of the systemic disruptions that occurred because of lax regulation. It has helped us crack down on irresponsible behavior.He spoke about how the big banks had collectively raised $700 billion more capital, how there were now mechanisms for orderly unwinding banks that get into financial trouble without having to bail them out and how financial derivatives were in the process of being more heavily regulated. He painted a pretty rosy picture of how extensively things have changed on Wall Street and in Washington to try to prevent the kind of financial meltdown we endured.The problem is that regulation alone will not change the bad behavior that occasionally breaks out into the open on Wall Street and often leads to disasters on Main Street.Wall Street is not like other industries. As repulsive as it is that executives at Volkswagen sought to evade United States emission standards, that deceit is not likely to bring down the worlds economy.But when things go wrong on Wall Street, the consequences can be devastating for the rest of us. On Wall Street, contagion is a real problem. That is why it is not enough to require banks to hold more capital or to have them reduce the amount of risky assets they have leveraged on their balance sheets or to prevent them from making the kinds of proprietary bets that sometimes go awry.Two things still need to change on Wall Street for there to be meaningful reform. First, the culture of what constitutes success inside a Wall Street firm  who gets promoted and put in charge and for what reasons  needs to change. Second, the compensation system needs a total revamp so that bankers, traders and executives are no longer rewarded for taking big risks with other peoples money, putting themselves in a position to win big if their risk-taking pays off but not to be held accountable if things go wrong.The good news, if there is any, is that some lip service has been paid to trying to change Wall Streets culture. Twice in the last two years, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has held closed-door meetings and seminars with many of the leaders of Wall Street companies to convey to them that Wall Streets behavior must change or change will be imposed upon it.In a speech at the bank in October 2014, William C. Dudley, its president, said that culture relates to what should I do, and not to what can I do. He said it fell to top executives to fix the broken culture, and fast: Senior leaders need to hold up a mirror to their own behavior and critically examine behavioral norms at their firm. Hes right, of course, but lets be honest, not much has changed on the culture front on Wall Street.Even less has changed about the compensation system on Wall Street. People are rewarded for closing deals, underwriting stocks and bonds, securitizing mortgages, car loans and credit-card receivables, and trading with counterparties. They are rewarded for putting together the people who have capital with the people who want capital. That is a hugely important function, assuming we like capitalism and want it to keep functioning properly.But too often on Wall Street, the enduring lust by bankers, traders and executives for big annual bonuses results in behavior that benefits them at our expense. Notwithstanding talk of clawbacks and lower overall pay, the compensation system on Wall Street remains untouched after the crisis. That means that the very system that regulates what people do every day on Wall Street remains the same.To his credit, President Obama recognized at the White House meeting on March 7 that the compensation system on Wall Street remains broken.We still have work to do to complete regulations related to executive compensation to make sure that individuals who are working in these financial institutions are less incentivized to take big, reckless risks that could end up harming our financial sector over all, he said.Hes right about that. And thats one of the reasons I lament his departure from the Oval Office next January: Theres virtually no chance that either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton will touch this subject."}
{"text": "What will a topical talk show look like on Netflix, a streaming service thats better known for releasing entire seasons of its content all at once and which has no programming schedule to speak of? Chelsea Handler offered a few clues on Wednesday about the ongoing Netflix series shell soon be hosting, presented as a handwritten memo to herself that she posted online.This is your new show schedule, wrote Ms. Handler, who previously hosted the E! late-night series Chelsea Lately from 2007 to 2014, so if youre thinking about having a baby  DONT.Ms. Handler said that her Netflix show will have its debut on May 11, and will have new half-hour episodes three times a week, on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. (Once these episodes are posted, she wrote, they will be available until the end of time, so put a little more thought into what you say this time around.) She said the new series will see her traveling around the world and learning new things, but suggested it will still feature her conversations with public figures and celebrity guests. (She also urged herself not to give up on her Top 3 ideal guests: Michelle Obama, the Pope and Arnold Schwarzeneggers maid.)Netflix said that a title for Ms. Handlers show and other details will be announced at a news conference on Thursday."}
{"text": "MANILA  It is a financial whodunit for the digital era: More than $80 million of Bangladeshs money vanished last month after it was electronically transferred out of that countrys account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.As officials around the world search for the money and place blame, the caper is highlighting what looks like a weak point in the global financial system that allowed the money to get by regulators: the murky banking system of the Philippines.The countrys investigators are now looking into how the money came to be transferred to that Pacific nation  and what happened to it afterward. The trip, which appears to jump from Philippine banks to the countrys lightly regulated casinos and then to points unknown, touches on a number of pressure points where United States officials and experts say the country is vulnerable to potential corruption and money-laundering.Specifically, they point to the countrys increasingly flush casino industry, which is exempt from many of the anti-money-laundering requirements in the Philippines. The Philippines also retains what one United States official once called some of the worlds toughest bank secrecy laws, recalling a time before the rise of concerns about terrorism financing and tax evasion, when countries promised privacy in the hopes of becoming financial hubs.They picked us to launder this money because our system is full of loopholes, Sergio R. Osmea III, a Philippine senator who leads a committee on banks and financial institutions, said in an interview on Wednesday. We have been trying to amend these laws for decades, but we cant get it through congress.Already the theft  one of the largest digital heists in history  has caused ripples round the globe. On Tuesday, Bangladeshs top central banker resigned. Bangladeshi officials have blamed their counterparts at the New York Fed.The New York Fed has said that the transfer requests came through official channels and that any security breach most likely came from Bangladesh. Officials who run the global money transfer system known as Swift said its systems had not been breached and said the matter was an internal issue at Bangladeshs central bank.In the Philippines, lawmakers this week questioned employees of local banks that had processed the transfers. They expressed frustration during that hearing at bank employees who declined to answer questions and cited their rights against self-incrimination.At this point, it is unclear exactly what went wrong and where the system broke down. But the people behind the theft made mistakes and tripped alarms.In early February, they requested that more than $100 million in money that Bangladesh keeps at the New York Fed be transferred out. On one transfer request, they misspelled the word foundation, as fandation, putting a halt to about $20 million they tried to move to Sri Lanka.It is not clear whether the New York Fed spotted the typos, or failed to spot them.The culprits appear to have made off with about $81 million transferred to the Philippines, raising broader concerns about the countrys financial controls.The Philippines  a close American ally and a crucial part of Washingtons efforts to counter Chinas growing regional might  has moved in recent years to bring its disclosure requirements around the movement of large funds into line with international standards. It has enacted legislation against money laundering and set up a dedicated regulatory body to handle violations.But experts and American officials say it remains a difficult place to catch money launderers.In a report a year ago on financial crimes, the United States Department of State cited the countrys tight bank secrecy laws, a lack of regulation around casinos and difficulties faced by local regulators in watching transactions involving real estate, jewels and nonprofit groups. It said that in the first 10 months of 2014, the Philippines had one conviction and no prosecutions begun on money-laundering charges.The small number of prosecutions and convictions, the report said, is telling.Several United States diplomatic cables published by the group WikiLeaks also showed frustration with the laws. The bank secrecy laws in the Philippines are among the strictest in the world, Francis J. Ricciardone, then the United States ambassador, wrote in a 2005 cable. A successor, Kristie Kenney, said in a 2008 cable that the bank secrecy laws and poor whistle-blower protections hindered corruption and graft investigations.The bank secrecy laws are a legacy of Ferdinand Marcos, the countrys former dictator, who hoped they would help turn the Philippines into a financial hub. Though they were weakened in 2001 as part of an effort to fight terrorism funding, the laws still limit access by authorities without permission from the depositor.The bank secrecy laws have become sticking points in corruption trials there. During his 2012 impeachment trial, Renato C. Corona, the chief justice of the countrys supreme court, said he would not hand over a waiver of his bank privacy rights unless the lawmakers accusing him did the same for their own accounts. He was impeached, but he has denied the accusations of corruption.More recent concern has focused on the Philippines casinos. They are exempt from the anti-money-laundering law, meaning they are not required to report suspicious transactions.A good reason for targeting the Philippines could be the unusual situation where casinos have not been required to comply with the same anti-money-laundering regime that governs the banking system, said Paul Bromberg, the chief executive of Spectrum Asia, an investigative and gambling industry consultancy. Omitting the gaming industry from the formal compliance regime has been quite controversial.Built to rival Macau and other Asian gambling hubs, the Philippines casino sector has had some success in attracting large-scale foreign investment. Three huge casino hotels have opened on the outskirts of Manila in recent years. With a required minimum investment of $1 billion each, they are the first such properties in the country to approach the size and scope of Las Vegas-style resorts.The new casinos have helped to lure some high rollers, known as V.I.P. gamblers, from mainland China to the Philippines, increasing total gambling revenue to nearly $3 billion last year. That compares with about $30 billion in Macau and $5 billion in Singapore last year.Money from the Bangladesh central bank ended up being transferred to one of the Philippines newer casinos, Solaire, lawmakers learned in the hearing on Tuesday.In response to questioning, Silverio Benny Tan, the corporate secretary of Bloomberry Resorts, the parent company of Solaire, said the equivalent of about $29 million was transferred in February to accounts at the casino controlled by a junket operator named Weikang Xu, according to video record of the proceedings. Junket operators are middlemen who bring high-rolling players to casinos and, especially in the case of gamblers from China, lend them money for gambling.Mr. Xus nationality was not clear, and he couldnt be reached for comment.Mr. Osmea, the senator, said the operators of the casinos involved are being invited to testify at a Senate hearing on Thursday to try to trace the money.The casinos here in the Philippines are a black hole, he said. Once the money goes in there, it is gone."}
{"text": "We may be a politically and culturally divided nation, but let us come together to agree on one thing: We can all enjoy watching a bald eagle being hatched.A live webcam fixed on a bald eagle nest in Washington is running 24 hours a day, and the first egg was expected to hatch as early as Tuesday.Fair warning: Most of the footage will be less than riveting, unless you really enjoy seeing an eagle periodically move its neck. Every now and then, the mother stands up and pokes her beak around the eggs. That is, indeed, pretty cool for a little while.The American Eagle Foundations webcam description suggested that high drama was possible.This is a wild eagle nest, and anything can happen, the site warned. Things like sibling rivalry, predators and natural disaster can affect this eagle family and may be difficult to watch.The would-be parents, named Mr. President and The First Lady, nested in a tulip poplar tree in 2014 at the United States National Arboretum, which is operated by the Department of Agriculture. They were the first pair in the location since 1947, according to the foundation.In 1963, bald eagles were close to extinction, with just 487 nesting pairs remaining, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. But the population has since recovered and is no longer considered endangered."}
{"text": "SAN DIEGO  Comic books and San Diego are nearly synonymous because of the annual Comic-Con International held each July. But IDW Publishing, a hometown company that exhibits at the convention, has given comic-book fans a reason to visit anytime by opening its San Diego Comic Art Gallery.The gallery is at the companys headquarters at Liberty Station, a mixed-use development in the citys Point Loma section that was formerly a naval training center. When the company moved there last year, setting up a gallery was one of its objectives. Its an airy, raw space with concrete floors and stark white walls that allow the comic art on display to pop.Its been a labor of love for all of us, said Ted Adams, IDWs chief executive and publisher. We wanted a place year-round where people could celebrate comic art.Whats unique about what we do is that we really show the process, he said. That means that visitors can often follow the development of works from thumbnail sketch to finished comic-book page.The gallerys exhibitions are tied to works published by IDW, a company whose projects often cross traditional publishing lines. In addition to its original properties, IDW has many licensed books (My Little Pony and Jem and the Holograms, for example) as well as its hardcover Artists Editions, which present the work of creators like Jack Kirby, Walter Simonson, Mike Mignola and Dave Gibbons, although their stories were originally done for DC, Marvel or other comic-book companies.There is always plenty to see at the gallery, which is segmented into a rotating space for a major show, a couple of smaller exhibitions and a permanent artist-in-residence studio. The Art of Marvels Star Wars, featuring the work of Howard Chaykin, was recently the main show and now is one of the smaller ones.There were a couple of pieces we couldnt display because they exceeded our insurance policy, Mr. Adams said. That is a testament to the increasing market value of original comic art, which in the earliest days of the industry was often given away or destroyed. Really iconic pieces can go for six figures, which is out of reach for most people, Mr. Adams said.Although interest in original art is rising, and comic-book characters are a fixture in animation, television series and big-budget films, places that specialize in comic art are few and far between. They include the Society of Illustrators in New York, the ToonSeum in Pittsburgh and the Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco, which shut down last September but is seeking a new location.The gallerys current show features 16 prints of Jack Kirbys Lord of Light. The work, based on a 1967 science fiction novel by Roger Zelazny, was supposed to inform a film adaptation and later a theme park. Neither happened, but the artwork was used by the Central Intelligence Agency as part of an elaborate ploy to rescue six State Department employees stranded in Tehran, an operation dramatized in the 2012 film Argo. Future exhibitions include one of classic war stories drawn by Joe Kubert, and one featuring around 70 daily and Sunday Bloom County newspaper strips by Berkeley Breathed, including the first appearance by Opus the Penguin.One of the most striking parts of the gallery space is the Eastman Studio, the artistic haven of Kevin Eastman, who created the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic-book series in 1984, with Peter Laird. It has all the knickknacks, tchotchkes and goofy things Ive collected the last 40 years, Mr. Eastman said.Like Mr. Adams, Mr. Eastman was always passionate about displaying comic-book art. He founded the Words & Pictures Museum of Fine Sequential Art in Northampton, Mass., which was open from 1992 to 1999. As the artist in residence at the San Diego museum, he is helping to organize shows and working on new Ninja Turtle projects. The studio, a re-creation of his work space at his San Diego home, is centered on a drafting table surrounded by reference material and floor-to-ceiling memorabilia.Seeing how an artist works has a special appeal for fans and professionals alike, he said. Whenever I met another artist, or an artist came over to my house, the first thing we wanted to see was where we created, Mr. Eastman said.But the Eastman Studio may have the biggest appeal for someone closer to home. If you had come to my house a year ago, this is what you wouldve seen, he said. Keeping so much of his material at the gallery makes my wife a little happier."}
{"text": "Hikaru Nakamura grew up in White Plains, with a celebrated chess teacher for a stepfather. Fabiano Caruana grew up in Park Slope, where he attended the Berkeley Carroll School and learned to play chess at Congregation Beth Elohim at the age of 5. Both now in their 20s, both home-schooled after the primary grades, they are phenoms of the sort that New York seems to produce with some regularity, and what they do phenomenally well is play chess.Mr. Nakamura at age 15 became the youngest American grandmaster ever, until Mr. Caruana earned the title at 14.Now they are vying to return to the city for the biggest match of their lives.For the first time since 1995, when it was held on the 107th floor of the World Trade Center, the world chess championship is scheduled to take place in New York in November, and there is a chance that one of these two masters will be challenging for the title. If either were to win, he would be the first American since Bobby Fischer to achieve that goal, after a drought of more than four decades.It is exceedingly rare for a single American to make it this far, let alone two.In the chess world, this is huge, said Bryan Quick, executive director of the century-old Marshall Chess Club on West 10th Street, where both contenders played tournaments when they were younger. It shows that U.S. chess is on an upswing.It will be a changed game in a city that has changed around it.Some of those changes are on display right now in Moscow, where eight of the worlds best players, including Mr. Nakamura and Mr. Caruana, are competing for the chance to challenge the current champion, Magnus Carlsen, in New York in November.The two Americans  neither lives in New York anymore  faced off in the first round of the tournament, displaying their different styles. Mr. Nakamura, 28, began aggressively, taking an early advantage. Mr. Caruana, 23, coolly worked out a draw.What was more revelatory, at least for the uninitiated, was what happened next.Minutes after the game ended, the two stared into matching laptops, analyzing the what-ifs. What if Mr. Nakamura had moved his rook there? Or there? With each move, the computers scanned databases and fed back the likelihood of positive outcomes. The two grandmasters, in turn, deferred to the higher authority.Mr. Nakamura frowned at an unmade move that, according to the computer, might have enabled him to press his advantage. Here was the point at which human genius diverged from machine.O.K., weve seen the computer evaluation, so we see its very good, he said of the move. But over the board its very hard to play a move like that.The rise of big data has changed the way chess is played and the way it is taught, to the dismay of some who remember the days before Garry Kasparov lost to IBMs Deep Blue in 1997. These days, the phone in your pocket can beat the very best chess player on earth.Its removed some of the poetry of it, said Bruce Pandolfini, a celebrated chess instructor who taught Fabiano Caruana from age 5 to age 7. Chess instills in you to work with a plan. Computers dont do that. They dont suggest plans. They just tell you whats the right move.When he discusses strategies with students, Mr. Pandolfini said, their parents are often looking into phones, then declaring what the right move should be.Frank Brady, president emeritus of the Marshall Chess Club, said he worried that computers rob some of the grace of the game.Theres something about someone figuring out the moves, a charm and excitement for someone who is not booked up, Mr. Brady said.He added, If youre not computer savvy, youre at a disadvantage. And these little kids who come along are into it tenfold.For players at the level of Mr. Nakamura and Mr. Caruana, this means scouring databases to study their opponents preferred openings and the moves that the computer says are most likely to prevail against them. Their seconds are often computer specialists.Mr. Nakamura, speaking by Skype from Moscow before the start of the tournament, said that computers had created a generational difference among chess players. At 28, he said, he is old enough to remember the days before computers were better than human players, but young enough to have made his mark in the computer age.If you talk to some of the older players, they definitely say they see beauty in certain games, he said. In my case, there are certain times when I think, Wow, thats so amazing, chess is so full of ideas. But most of the time I tend to be much more pragmatic about it, as opposed to thinking about it as art or something exquisite.He recalled an unhappy experience in 2011 while training with Garry Kasparov, who successfully defended his championship in 1995 at the World Trade Center, and whom many consider the greatest chess player of all. There were a lot of times when his understanding of chess from when he grew up, his intuition, or feel, was simply wrong according to the computer, Mr. Nakamura said. It showed how much different chess is now. Because computers are the ultimate authority. You just automatically accept what they say, and you move on.But if there is less poetry at the highest levels of chess these days, the game is enjoying a resurgence in New York, after a lull that saw the Manhattan Chess Club close in 2002 after 125 years. And much of the boom is driven by very young players who learn the game at school. At the Success Academy charter school network, every student takes mandatory chess training as part of the curriculum  not as an after-school activity  from kindergarten to fourth grade. This year that comes to about 9,000 students. Public schools have also increased their chess programs; a nonprofit called Chess in the Schools runs programs in 50 elementary and middle schools, serving about 13,000 low-income students.It gets kids to fall in love with thinking, said Sean OHanlon, who designed the Success Academy chess curriculum.At Intermediate School 318 in Williamsburg, which regularly produces championship boys and girls teams, chess is as popular as basketball, the principal, Eric Windley, said. And basketball is very popular, he added.None of this means that there is a New York style of chess, said Sunil Weeramantry, the executive director of the National Scholastic Chess Foundation (and Mr. Nakamuras stepfather), but it means that young players in New York have steady opportunities to compete. A third of the players in any national tournament will come from the tristate area, Mr. Weeramantry said.In his own home, the top contender was supposed to be Hikarus older brother, Asuka, who was national champion for six years. Then Hikaru surpassed him. That had the effect of making Asuka pull away, Mr. Weeramantry said. I felt guilty. He kept everything to himself. He didnt let on that this bothered him, but one day it all came out: Im older than him; Im smarter than him; why cant I beat him? He plays for recreation now, and works at JPMorgan. Mr. Weeramantry said he recognized that Hikaru had the temperament to excel when his younger son suffered a terrible loss in Spain, and he bounced back the next day.In the early rounds in Moscow, through Thursday, Mr. Caruana had a series of draws that left him in the middle of the pack, within reach of the leaders. Mr. Nakamura lost two of his first six games, greatly diminishing his chances. The 14-round tournament ends March 29.The outcome could determine the shape and scope of the showdown in New York; the venue, the excitement level, the embrace of the city that helped produce two of the contenders. Mr. Quick of the Marshall Chess Club said he hoped the presence of an American challenger might help recapture the mania that followed Mr. Fischers rise in the 1970s. The championship match in Reykjavik in 1972, which stood as a proxy battle between the United States and the Soviet Union, was broadcast live on national television and landed Mr. Fischer on the covers of Time and Life.The country changed after Mr. Fischers Cold War triumph over Boris Spassky, said Miron Sher, a Russian-born grandmaster who lives in Brooklyn and coached Mr. Caruana from 1999 to 2004. It could be like that now, especially if an American wins, he said. We have to prepare people for it."}
{"text": "Yesterday, Nike hosted journalists from around the world for a preview of its newest innovations  at what felt like a tech conference, a fashion show and an awards show rolled into one. The special guest Kevin Hart welcomed the crowd to Moynihan Station (which happens to be an official New York Fashion Week venue) before the brands president and C.E.O., Mark Parker, revealed what was in store: Nikes first self-lacing shoe, its latest walking-on-air technology (vapor-filled soles), anti-clog cleats  and an update to the Nike+ app.Were at the dawn of a new era of sport, Parker said. Its the era of personalized performance. With the new Nike+ offerings, launching in June, the brand hopes to bring that level of attention and curation to the masses. There will still be the same on-demand training programs the app is known for, plus a personal shopper of sorts, and extra motivation from professional athletes and so on.To say that the event on Wednesday was filled with, and focused on, athletes would be an understatement  especially because the company believes that everyone with a body is an athlete. With the Olympic track star Allyson Felix modeling new performance apparel, and the USA Basketball team member Kevin Durants newest shoes on view, excitement around this summers Olympic Games in Rio filled the air. And after a workout to test everything in store (also led in part by Hart), T caught up with Sanya Richards-Ross, who is currently training to compete in Rio  and was on site to help motivate flailing journalists during the sweat session. Below, the Austin-based Olympic champion, who won gold in the 400 meters at the London Summer Games, shares her training, diet and beauty tips.For faster mileage, Richards-Ross suggests strength training that covers the entire body  not just legs. I do a lot of Olympic lifts, and a lot of power cleans to keep my muscles strong and explosive. And then I do focus a lot on my core, so I do a lot of core training with med balls, physioballs; a lot of planking for stabilization. And I also do upper body  especially because I have to have a really strong shoulders-and-back chain for my arms to pump down on the straightaway.I think one of the things that people always forget when theyre working on their core is their lower back. So one of the tips I give people all the time is if youre doing 100 sit-ups, I do 75 on the front and 25 on the back. An example of a lower back extension is the superman exercise: Lying on your stomach, raise your arms, legs and chest off the floor for a beat before lowering back to the floor. You have to focus on the front and the back in order to have a really strong core.Richards-Ross eats three solid meals a day, which she supplements with one or two juices per day  and occasionally a protein shake. I have a really clean diet, so for me its about having high protein. I eat a lot of grilled chicken and fish. And I juice my fruits and vegetables a lot. It just makes it easier to get them in throughout the day, so my NutriBullet is going all the time; and you know Im getting my beets and celery and everything  the more colorful the better.Im like obsessed with my Dior mascara right now. And then I always wear a light foundation. Ive been wearing a Sephora brand thats perfect  its a liquid foundation. I feel that if I have that on with a little bit of mascara, Im good to go.I use a product from Jamaica for my skin, its a line called Jencare. My mom has been using it, and if you see my mom  her skins amazing. (Its true. It is.)Richards-Ross doesnt leave Austin without her stretch rope and weight gloves. I think the secret to staying fit on the go is prioritizing your training. Its really easy to make excuses throughout the day to not get it done. So what I do is just get up early, knock it out and then, you know, get on with the rest of my day.This interview has been edited and condensed."}
{"text": "MOSCOW  President Vladimir V. Putin on Wednesday warned against politicizing the doping scandal that has touched a number of Russian athletes, and he criticized his nations sports officials for failing to take the issue seriously.It is clear that our sports officials failed to realize the importance of these questions, Mr. Putin said at a government meeting in the Kremlin.Several prominent Russian athletes, including the tennis star Maria Sharapova and Semion Elistratov, an Olympic gold medalist in speedskating, have recently tested positive for the banned drug meldonium. The drug is produced in Latvia, a former Soviet state, and is commonly used across Eastern Europe to enhance the hearts oxygen intake and blood flow. The World Anti-Doping Agency banned it on Jan. 1.In November, the agency published a report containing allegations of state-sponsored doping and mass corruption in Russian athletics, prompting the International Association of Athletics Federations to provisionally suspend Russia.Some pro-government commentators suggested that Russia was being singled out to punish it for its active foreign policy. But Mr. Putin swept aside such conjecture.We should not put forward any conspiracy theories  we should systematically and in a timely manner react to the decisions that are being made, including on the level of international organizations, Mr. Putin said, according to a transcript on the Kremlins website.It is obvious that our antidoping legislation needs serious improvement if we experience such failures, he said. I am asking the government to work on this and other issues to raise the effectiveness of the national fight against doping."}
{"text": "Those blank-faced employees in blazers who guard museum galleries are likely to tell you not to stand too close to the paintings, not to touch the sculptures, not to take flash pictures.Those at the new Broad Museum in Los Angeles, however, are just as likely to volunteer information about, say, that Ellsworth Kelly canvas, Green Angle.  Might that abstraction actually stem from observations of real-world phenomena? (The peak of a sand dune? A ray of light from a window?)Or they might suggest places to go in the neighborhood after you leave the museum. Walt Disney Concert Hall? The restaurant Otium? The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels?Thats because the guards at the Broad are not guards in the conventional sense. Theyre not even called guards but are instead referred to as visitor services associates, or V.S.A.s.Dressed in black, with red lanyards around their necks, theyve been integral to the Broads identity since the museum, founded by the philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad, opened last fall on Grand Avenue. Collectively  and quietly  the associates are redefining the museumgoing experience.The Broads No. 1 objective from the beginning was to connect a wide audience with contemporary art, said Joanne Heyler, the museums founding director. To do that effectively, we had to think about how you can be truly welcoming and engaging in new ways.The redefined guard is key to this, as are the free admission and the architecture, which puts the lobby at street level and offers internal windows into the museums storage. Already, the approach is paying off. The Broad attracted more than 300,000 visitors in its first six months, roughly the number it had expected for its first full year.The Broads and I wanted people to feel that once theyre inside the museum, the museum, in a sense, is theirs, said Ms. Heyler, who has curated the Broad collection and directed the Broad Art Foundations lending library program since 1995, and visitors can shape their visit in an infinite number of ways, so that the experience is less didactic and more about engagement thats driven by the visitor.In devising this approach, Ms. Heyler took a page from the retail world, namely Apple stores, in which sales employees roam the space with remote, hand-held devices, rather than ring up customers at a conventional checkout counter.There was a point  looking at the floor plan, with a door to the lobby on the north, and a door to the lobby to the south  when we said, How do you deal with that? Ms. Heyler said. Its a fluid environment in that lobby. Why do we need a desk? Why are we trying to force this old model into a building that is not a traditional piece of museum architecture?The visitor services associates are a group of aspiring artists, practicing artists, students and retirees who come to the Broad with an existing professional engagement with art or a strong interest in art, Ms. Heyler said.To make sure they would be really meaningful guides to the collection, she added, the Broad devised an online learning management system that trained the associates in subjects from the art itself to local attractions.Meg FitzRoy, 32, one of the associates, said that she sometimes had to translate the German in a work by the artist Joseph Beuys; to provide context about post-Civil War history near the work of Kara Walker; and to talk about the incredible energy that was in New York City from 1981 to 1991, and how the art community was responding to that, when people were looking at the art of Jean-Michel Basquiat or Keith Haring.Thats the most exciting aspect of the job, said Ms. FitzRoy, who has a masters degree in contemporary art history, the thing that makes you feel the closest to the artwork.The Los Angeles artist Mark Bradford, whose work is included in the collection, was so inspired by the associates that he offered to give a talk to them. In most museums, it seems that the guards are invisible, and I never liked that, Mr. Bradford said. Because the reality is, theyre not invisible.The associates learn how to read body language  whether people have questions they dont have the courage to ask, or would rather have a more solitary, contemplative experience.We dont want to bombard them, like Disney employees  waving our hands and singing songs, Ms. FitzRoy said. There are some guests who would rather be left alone."}
{"text": "It was just six months ago that three venture capitalists, Trish, James and Palmer Higgins, took the biggest leap of their relatively young lives.After a year researching 1,000 businesses, holding 75 conference calls and visiting prospects coast to coast, they made a decision. They would put their money  and their hearts  not into some cool Silicon Valley tech upstart or e-commerce innovator but into a snow removal and landscaping operation in Portland, Me.And they said in an interview with The New York Times for an article about their plans that they would double down on the risk by moving to Maine from their home in Greenwich, Conn., even before the deal was done. They became co-owners of Seabreeze Property Services in September with the companys founders, John and Pete Kelly.So now, with a half-year and a comparatively mild winter behind them, how is it going? What might the difference be between expectations for a new business and the reality? The question is one new business owners face all the time.Its easy to put together a grand strategy, said Ms. Higgins, 30, who bought the business with her husband, James, 31, and his brother, Palmer, 28. The big challenge is executing the day-to-day operation.While most people tend to think of start-ups as a way to be your own boss, an increasing number of people  some fresh out of business school and others looking for a second career  are buying small businesses, or buying into them.The average price of such a business in 2015 was just under $200,000 according to BizBuySell.com, the largest small-business marketplace in North America, but 8 percent of its businesses sell for more than $1 million.Such small business may not be as trendy as start-ups, but for many eager to be their own bosses, they can be more rewarding than working in the corporate world.And they are less risky. According to the Small Business Administration, about half of all new businesses fail within five years.The Small Business Administration has no specific numbers of success rates among buyers of operating small businesses. However, Natalia Olson-Urtecho, mid-Atlantic regional director of the agency, said they were probably much higher than among owners of start-ups, because most businesses will not find buyers if they are not viable.If you buy an existing successful business, it already has a client base, said Ed Pendarvis, founder of Sunbelt Business Brokers, a company that brokers deals between small-business buyers and sellers.Also, said Mr. Pendarvis, who founded Business Buyers University, a company that offers information on buying and owning a business, in a typical financing case, most sellers have a financial stake in the company they are selling for several years after the sale, so they have a vested interest in its continuing success.If Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition, the class taught by Royce Yudkoff and Richard Ruback, professors at Harvard Business School, is any evidence, interest in small-business acquisition is growing rapidly. Five years ago, when they first offered the class, only a handful of students were interested. Last year 270 students took the course.Small-business loans grew to $8 billion last year from $6 billion in 2014, Ms. Olson-Urtecho said, and many of them went to people buying operating companies. And the sale of small businesses grew by 53 percent from 2012 to 2015, according to BizBuySell.com, which now has more than 47,000 active listings.The Higgins group invested between $5 million and $10 million in Seabreeze Property Services, but declined to disclose an exact price.The Kellys, who have owned the business for 20 years, run the day-to-day operation, while the Higginses are developing an overarching expansion strategy.The Kellys talked to dozens of people about a possible partnership over the years to get to the next level, Pete Kelly, 46, said. Then things clicked with the Higginses.This was a marriage, John Kelly, 51, said. If it wasnt the right fit, we never would have partnered up.Ms. Higgins agreed. We couldnt do what they do, and they couldnt do what we do, she said.And while the Kellys and Higginses speak enthusiastically of the partnership, even honeymoons have problems. For one thing, Seabreeze had no comprehensive database for properties it services.It may sound easy, but most of the work is in a very tight circle around Portland, James Higgins said. They kept track of properties via nicknames, and the senior people know what to do and have all the knowledge in their heads, so something as simple as an address isnt written down. Were plotting it out.Palmer Higgins said one of the first challenges was transferring a whiteboard system that specifies who is working on what property into a computerized system.I knew it would be a big project and, if done well, would be a huge boon, but its not a simple thing, he said. If you change this, you have to change that and this and this. Its like pulling a string.So they have had to contain their eagerness to rush forward, and have postponed the new computer system.Acquiring a business and keeping the original owners on as partners is less typical than taking over completely, and has its advantages and disadvantages.The positive is that you have someone deeply experienced in the business, Professor Yudkoff said. But owners have operated as entrepreneurs who are answerable to no one, he said. It can be hard to change that.Randy Shayler, who bought a musical instrument rental company in Reading, Pa., took over the entire ownership of the 93-year-old business, Zeswitz Music, three years ago. He was a management consultant before attending Harvard Business School, and thought he would probably run his own company later.It was not until he took Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition that he realized it could be the next step in his career.After looking at about 200 possibilities and seriously considering six, he settled on Zeswitz, which he bought for several million dollars, using a Small Business Administration loan and investments from the very people who inspired his decision, Professors Yudkoff and Ruback. They have invested in the businesses of eight former students.Although the owner no longer helps run the company, she is a great resource, Mr. Shayler, 31, said, as is the highly experienced work force.His business has grown significantly, he said, and he attributes that to spending several days a week doing sales calls at schools, and improving the quality of the instruments, their repairs and tracking the numbers.I know that 98 percent of repairs go back out in two weeks, Mr. Shayler said. I dont think that was tracked before.Devin Mackoff, 30, like the Higginses, was featured in The Times article six months ago, right after he bought a landscaping company, Landscape Cod, on Cape Cod. He put $150,000 down and guaranteed the sellers about 10 percent of the revenue over the next three years. After a hectic summer, the winter gave him much-needed time to regroup.He decided to shift his business more toward gardening and project work and away from landscape maintenance. After some employees left him in the lurch, he said he was seeking a better way to recruit and keep staff.We grew the business 10 percent last year, which is good, but I really needed the break to step back and say, This is working and this isnt.  he said. I need to have more people on deck rather than scrambling for them if someone just quits by text. I want people who want to work.Buying a small business, unlike creating a start-up, means inheriting someone elses procedures, decisions and vision. And it may take a while not only to create a new vision, but also to determine the best way to get there.We realize that even if we know where we want to go, Ms. Higgins said, we still have to figure out the right pace."}
{"text": "LONDON  German submarines and battle cruisers are operating on the American side of the Atlantic, Prime Minister Winston Churchill told a startled audience at a Pilgrim Society luncheon given today [March 18] for Ambassador John G. Winant.The Prime Minister revealed that independently routed ships not in convoy had been sunk as far west as the 42d meridian of west longitude  about 1,500 miles west of the coast of Spain and 1,500 miles east of New York. The battle cruisers referred to appeared to be the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, which, although listed by Janes Fighting Ships as battleships, are of only 26,000 tons but can do more than twenty-nine knots and are armed with nine 11-inch and twelve 5.9-inch guns.Following this revelation with a well timed indiscretion, the Prime Minister then gave Ambassador Winant, whose health he was proposing, the news of the certain destruction of three German submarines yesterday.

{"text": "SEOUL, South Korea   Punishing a foreign tourist with 15 years of prison and hard labor for trying to steal a poster inscribed with a political slogan might seem preposterous in most of the world. This week, North Koreas Supreme Court did just that to Otto F. Warmbier, a 21-year-old American student.But in North Korea, where the leader is treated as a deity, political slogans are sacrosanct  a point that does not loom large in many outside appraisals of Mr. Warmbiers plight.At the beginning of each year, North Korea issues a new set of slogans as unbreakable guides. The gate of every factory and the wall of every classroom bear such slogans. The freshly painted and ubiquitous red-on-white banners are virtually the only thing that leaps out in otherwise drab North Korean towns.And the most important among them  the ones that must be treated like sacred objects  are those that bear the names of the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, his father Kim Jong-il, and his grandfather, the Norths founding president, Kim Il-sung, North Korean defectors and South Korean officials say.Official North Korean accounts said the evidence presented at Mr. Warmbiers trial showed he tried to steal one of those.Lets arm ourselves strongly with Kim Jong-ils patriotism! read the slogan.Although the name Kim Jong-il was covered by a white block in the photos of the slogan released on North Korean news media, there was no mistaking it. Since his fathers death in 2011, Kim Jong-un has repeatedly called for education in Kim Jong-ils patriotism and the slogan has become common.Prosecutors presented closed-circuit television footage of a man they said was Mr. Warmbier taking down the slogan from a wall of his hotel in Pyongyang at night.On Wednesday, the North Korean court ruled that Mr. Warmbiers action constituted subversion against North Korea.It is hard to overstate the importance North Koreans attach to safeguarding the names and images of the Kims, who have ruled by a personality cult for decades.North Korean news media have reported the heroic deeds of villagers who rushed into houses engulfed in flames to save the portraits of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, hung on the walls of every home.When South Korean tourists were allowed to visit the Norths scenic Diamond Mountain between 1998 and 2008, they found North Korean officials standing guard around slogan trees, whose trunks were inscribed with political slogans bearing the names of the Kims.Likewise, harming slogans bearing their names can be one of the most serious crimes in the North. Defectors have testified about neighbors banished to prison camps for sitting on a newspaper that happened to carry the photo of one of the Kims.In its 2014 report on North Korea, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry noted that the governments system of demanding absolute obedience to the supreme leader has facilitated the unchecked violation of human rights."}
{"text": "The industrial designer and artist Viktor Schreckengost, who died in 2008 at 101, left behind a multitude of artifacts and documents related to his seven-decade career in Cleveland. Plans were announced for a museum in Cleveland devoted to his works, but the project stalled. Last month, The Plain Dealer reported that the Schreckengost family decided to sell part of the estate through Heritage Auctions in Dallas.The sale of a few hundred pieces, on May 13, will include streamlined ceramic dinnerware that Mr. Schreckengost designed for American companies starting in the 1930s, as well as his sketches for dishes, toys and other products. Heritage will also offer his theater set designs, ceramic sculptures and childrens pedal cars. Among other items for sale are his drafting tools, monogrammed attach case, Navy uniform from his World War II service and furniture designed by colleagues including Gilbert Rohde, Isamu Noguchi, and Charles and Ray Eames.Marianne Berardi, the Heritage expert handling the sale, described sifting through the estate as a herculean task. Mr. Schreckengost, she said, would fill entire sketchbooks, just one after the other. When he was 96, he was asked about his plans for the material; Ms. Berardi said that his answer was a chuckle, a shrug and a modest suggestion that his heirs take it to the curb and let people help themselves.His family has donated pieces to the Cleveland Institute of Art, including ceramic busts exhibited at the 1939 Worlds Fair. His widow, Gene Schreckengost, said there have been discussions with a few other high-profile institutions about placing specific items. She added, We do not at present see a way forward for a museum devoted singularly to Vik, but the family is actively pursuing making his works publicly accessible through the Western Reserve Historical Society in Cleveland.A number of his public sculptures and plaques have been restored. In June, his terra-cotta reliefs of adult and baby mastodons and mammoths will go on display on the grounds of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.George Washingtons heirs left Mount Vernon largely empty, his possessions sold off after his death in 1799. Starting in the 1850s, when the Mount Vernon Ladies Association turned his Virginia estate into a museum, benefactresses donated antiques they described as giving a cheerful appearance to rooms that had looked desolate and forlorn.Scholars have found that many of the gifts would probably not have suited Washingtons tastes. On April 19, Freemans auction house in Philadelphia will offer about 70 pieces from Mount Vernon that have been deemed historically inaccurate.Estimates range from a few hundred dollars each for flat-topped Windsor armchairs, which were manufactured in the 1890s for the houses piazza, to about $200,000 for a parlors pair of mahogany side chairs made around 1760 in Philadelphia. The 19th-century donors included Jean Margaret Davenport Lander, a British-born actress and widow of a Union general, and Ida Richardson, a New Orleans philanthropist who supported education for African-Americans, was the daughter of slave owners and the widow of a Confederate surgeon.Carol Borchert Cadou, a senior vice president at Mount Vernon, said the museum has replaced some American pieces with British counterparts; Washington ordered furniture from Britain in bulk. For the piazza, the museum has commissioned rounded Windsor chairs tinted mahogany brown, modeled after furniture Washington owned.His former possessions keep resurfacing. His mahogany tea table is for sale at S. J. Shrubsole  in Manhattan (priced at $225,000). Mount Vernon has received a gift of his lidded porcelain sugar bowl with painted scrollwork; the previous owners had used it to store paper clips. In 2013, Mount Vernon paid $602,500 at Sothebys in New York for Benjamin Henry Latrobes watercolor scene of Washingtons family dining on the piazza.A book due this fall, First in the Homes of His Countrymen: George Washingtons Mount Vernon in the American Imagination, by Lydia Brandt, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina, will explore the evolution of the rooms and the dissemination of photographs of the interiors. As the Civil War raged around Mount Vernon, Dr. Brandt said, Union and Confederate benefactresses were able to transcend politics.In 2012, a British auction house offered a framed artwork that the catalog described as an unusual feather collage picture, in 17th-century style. It depicts the Archangel Michael, wings outspread, spearing a horned devil underfoot. It sold for about $6,000, five times the high estimate. Experts have since concluded that it is actually worth a few hundred thousand dollars. Its glittering feather mosaic was made in Mexico around 1590, and it had probably hung in a roomful of exotic treasures owned by the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolf II, in Prague.The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston acquired the panel last year, and it goes on view March 26 in a traveling exhibition, Made in the Americas: The New World Discovers Asia, at Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library in Wilmington, Del. (It will return to Boston early next year.)Its microscopic bits of feathers were plucked from hummingbirds, parrots and other birds. No one knows how the luxurious piece left Rudolfs castle; the unnamed British auction consignor had inherited it.Dennis Carr, a curator of American decorative arts and sculpture at the Museum of Fine Arts, said that the feather scene most likely amazed people who first uncrated it at Rudolfs gloomy palace. When viewed from certain angles, he said, it just explodes with color.A new essay collection, Images Take Flight: Feather Art in Mexico and Europe 1400-1700, analyzes Mexican feathered works that were exported to royal collections. There are a few that, like the Museum of Fine Arts discovery, ended up back in the New World. A 16th-century Mexican shield, with feathers in geometric patterns, spent about 300 years in Habsburg palaces in Belgium and Austria. In 1865, Maximilian I took it to Mexico, where he proclaimed himself ruler, and it has remained at Chapultepec Castle in Mexico City, the home he fled after just three years in power."}
{"text": "Whether Shakespeare or someone else wrote it, you have to admire the prescience of Double Falsehood, at least as its being staged in a well-conceived production by the Letter of Marque Theater Company. Thanks largely to a scalding scene in the first half of the show, a central plotline seems as if it could be a commentary on the modern-day scourges of date rape and on-campus assaults.The play has long been a source of debate among scholars over whether it can be wholly or partly attributed to Shakespeare. Last year, two experts who analyzed its language asserted that Shakespeares hand is unmistakable.Certainly the story (based on the Cardenio episode of Don Quixote) is very Shakespearean: romantic triangles and treacheries; altered identities; class differences as an obstacle to love. It centers on two sons of a duke: the upright Roderick (Welland H. Scripps) and the prodigal Henriquez (Adam Huff, whose performance anchors this production admirably).Henriquez has his eye on a commoner, Violante (Poppy Liu), and when she spurns his advances, he forces himself on her. The rape is not seen onstage, but Mr. Huffs rendition of a mans trying to rationalize his guilt afterward  it could not have been rape because she didnt scream, he says  sounds very much like the defense sometimes heard today from men who think that no somehow doesnt mean no. And Ms. Lius depiction of how sexual assault shatters the victim is haunting.This stark dramatic high point comes early, and its never quite equaled, which is why if this is a Shakespeare work, its a secondary one. It lacks the depth and memorable dialogue of the more famous plays, although this production stays watchable throughout. (Tickets are free for those who reserve in advance.)The director, Andrew Borthwick-Leslie, and set designer, Steven Brenman, make excellent use of the vast playing space in the Irondale Center to tell the story, which also involves Henriquezs friend Julio (Zach Libresco), who is on the verge of becoming engaged to Leonora (Montana Lampert Hoover). With Julio away running an errand, Henriquez makes a move on Leonora, rendering himself doubly loathsome. It is left to Roderick to set things right.The play is problematic from a modern perspective in that rapists should end up in jail, but Henriquez doesnt. This production, though, finds a note to end on that refuses to compromise. Despite Rodericks efforts and perhaps the playwrights intentions, all is not right with the world as the lights come down."}
{"text": "The former general counsel of Turing Pharmaceuticals said on Thursday that he and other executives had repeatedly objected to a plan by Martin Shkreli, then chief executive, to impose a huge price increase on a decades-old drug.In testimony to a Senate committee, the lawyer, Howard Dorfman, said he had told Mr. Shkreli that the move would have a severely negative impact on Turings business and reputation and was not justified because the company had not spent anything yet on research and development.Mr. Dorfman said he was fired in August, two to three weeks after voicing his objections.Mr. Shkreli told me that he was the most knowledgeable person with regard to this business model, that I was seriously misinformed, Mr. Dorfman said, noting that he himself had been in the pharmaceutical industry for 30 years. He added that Mr. Shkreli, 32, basically said that no one cares about prices.It turns out people did care. The overnight price increase in August in a drug used to treat a potentially dangerous parasitic infection  to $750 a pill from $13.50  set off a national furor that has lowered pharmaceutical stock prices and made drug prices into an issue in the presidential campaign.Mr. Shkreli resigned from Turing in December after being arrested and charged with securities fraud related to his time running a hedge fund and an earlier pharmaceutical company, Retrophin. Mr. Shkrelis lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said that because Mr. Shkreli was under indictment and would not comment, others apparently feel free to engage in what in our opinion amounts to revisionist history.The hearing was the second held by the Special Committee on Aging to examine companies like Turing that acquire old drugs and increase prices to the level of modern drugs for rare diseases.Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, which also engaged in the practice, has now forsworn it under pressure. The companys stock price has collapsed and questions are being raised about its viability as a company.Turing has argued that most patients pay far less than the list price and that the company makes sure that no patient who needs the drug, Daraprim, goes without it.But Dr. Adaora Adimora, an H.I.V. specialist at the University of North Carolina, told the committee that some patients with toxoplasmosis, the infection treated by Daraprim, had had to wait to get treatment they need urgently. She said doctors had to spend hours upon hours, or even days trying to persuade insurers or Turings patient assistance program to pay for the drug.Shannon and Joshua Weston of Whispering Pines, N.C., testified that their insurer would not pay for Daraprim for their baby daughter, Isla, even though toxoplasmosis can lead to brain damage and blindness in infants. The couple tried to figure out how they could raise $360,000 for the year of treatment that Isla needed. They were saved when the University of North Carolina said it had enough of the drug on hand to sell to them for $48 a month.Senators took turns sharply rebuking Turing, using terms like scam, sick game and the incarnation of evil. There was little discussion of possible policy measures to prevent such price increases.Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said there was bipartisan concern about interfering with the fair and free operation of the market for drugs in general. But he said that in cases of extortionate pricing, the market had failed, adding, I think there actually is a role for Congress to step in and put some price limits on.Two Turing executives were subpoenaed to testify: Ron Tilles, the chairman and interim chief executive, and Michael Smith, senior director of business development. Both said they had not been involved in the pricing decision so could not answer most questions about it, which frustrated some of the committee members.You cant come to this committee and say, you know, Im Sergeant Schultz; I see nothing, I know nothing,  Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut.Mr. Tilles said that although Turing had not spent money to develop Daraprim, it was using the profits from the price increase to develop new drugs. So in a way, its similar, he said.He refused a dare to lower the price, saying Turing was not yet profitable. When asked if the company would increase the price if it had a chance to do it over, he replied: Its hard to look back. Whats done is done."}
{"text": "The Clan, Pablo Traperos wrenching, exciting new film, could be described as an examination of the banality of evil. Its the story, closely based on actual events, of an ostentatiously normal family involved in crimes enabled by a climate of political violence and repression.But the patriarch, Arqumedes Puccio, played with regal sang-froid and deadpan perversity by Guillermo Francella, is also a study in the evil of banality. His steadfast attachment to conformity and respectability is inseparable from his coldblooded, self-serving sadism. In his own mind, everything he does  the kidnappings, the beatings, the occasional murder  is an expression of his essential rectitude. Hes a good father, a good businessman, a paragon of petit-bourgeois virtue who happens to keep hostages tied up in the basement.The pathology is not his alone. The Clan takes place in Buenos Aires in the early 1980s, when Argentina was ruled by a military dictatorship that specialized in disappearing its suspected political opponents. Arqumedes, though he is proud of his government connections (and adept at exploiting them), has neither an official position nor any particular ideological commitment. Hes in it for the money, selecting his prey based on the ransom he can collect. Rather than targeting supposed leftists, he and his accomplices  principally his son Alejandro (Peter Lanzani)  focus on members of their own class and social circle, including a young man who belongs to Alejandros rugby club.One of Alejandros brothers leaves Argentina to escape the family business. Another, returning from a year abroad, is initiated into it. Their sisters and their mother are not expected to participate, and one of the questions Mr. Trapero raises is how much they know, or permit themselves to know, about what is happening under their noses. Mostly, they regard Arqumedes with deference and adoration, helping to fashion an image of the perfect traditional family. He helps his daughters with their homework, addresses his wife with chivalrous courtesy and strives to embody a Latin American version of a Leave It to Beaver fatherly ideal. Hes a provider and a protector  stern, kind, capable and patient.There is an element of grisly, grotesque comedy in the gap between who the Puccios  Arqumedes, above all  really are and who they pretend to be, and Mr. Trapero, whose other features include the intense prison drama Lions Den, choreographs the contradictions of their domestic life with ferocious wit. The Clan is partly a dark satire of the authoritarian personality, an appalling CT scan of male entitlement and middle-class vanity.It is also a terrifically entertaining movie, which I dont entirely mean as praise. Mr. Traperos energetic style, his almost gleeful juxtapositions of sex and violence and his exuberantly Scorsesean musical cues often pull against the gravity of the story. The period details are meticulous, and the shifting dcor of the Puccio home provides a catalog of strenuously tasteful 80s bad taste that may touch a nostalgic chord in middle-aged viewers. The kidnappings and ransom negotiations provide jolts of suspense, as does the larger narrative of Arqumedess unraveling ambitions. As Argentina inches toward democracy, he becomes more desperate and reckless; Alejandros doubts about his father grow; and an inevitable reckoning approaches, for the family and the nation alike.Argentina awoke from the nightmare of dictatorship in 1983, and in the years since, in the midst of economic and political turmoil, its writers and filmmakers have grappled with the legacy of the dirty war. Mr. Trapero has set out to examine the period from the perspective of the guilty, to explore the psychology of both the active collaborators with a brutal system and its passive beneficiaries. The cleverest and most troubling aspect of the film is its empathy.Alejandro is such an appealing young man that we cant help rooting for him. His father, though despicable, is also intriguing and charismatic, partly because of Mr. Francellas commanding, disarmingly dignified performance. As fans of recent antihero-driven cable dramas know, its hard not to identify with a complicated protagonist, and Mr. Trapero exploits this habit of identification, ensnaring the audience, and maybe also the film itself, in an ethical trap. The violence is exciting, and its perpetrators are more interesting, more vivid and more real than the victims.When I first saw The Clan, at the Venice Film Festival last September, I was impressed by its insight and bothered by what I took as a certain glibness, a too-easy accommodation of moral horror to the imperatives of the thriller genre. On subsequent viewings, Ive come to appreciate this ambiguity as part of what Mr. Trapero is trying to address, and as an essential aspect of what his film reveals about the nature of authoritarianism. Fascism is seductive not only because it feeds fantasies of power and greatness, but also because, at a primal, visceral, libidinal level, it can be a lot of fun.The Clan is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Civilization and barbarism. In Spanish with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 50 minutes."}
{"text": "Readers afflicted with extreme spoiler sensitivity may want to cover their ears and start humming right now, since even the vaguest, most careful description of Jeff Nicholss Midnight Special risks giving away some important surprises. This is a film that generates much of its suspense through genre sleight of hand. If I even try to tell you what kind of movie it is  crime story, road picture, science-fiction allegory, religious prophecy  I might be telling you something youd rather not know just yet.The music that plays over the end credits gives the trickiness a final flourish. Its an updated cover of the song (most famously recorded by Lead Belly) that inspired the title. You may well wonder what that old, defiant prison ballad has to do with what you just saw. I have some thoughts on the subject. The Midnight Special in the song is, strictly speaking, a train, but its also a symbol of redemption, one of many that decorate the many-colored garment of American folklore.Mr. Nichols, a writer and director of three previous features, has a sincere interest in the traditions of American spirituality, including its wilder manifestations. He is also willing to entertain  and to entertain his audience with  the possibility that the zealots and crackpots may be onto something. In his second feature, Take Shelter, (2011) Michael Shannon played a hard-working family man plagued by forebodings of cosmic catastrophe. The movie spun a web of anxiety and ambiguity around the question of whether he was delusional or clairvoyant.Mr. Shannon  whose broad forehead, squinting eyes and hard-set jaw are as essential to Mr. Nicholss imagination as shotguns and pickup trucks  shows up in Midnight Special as one of a pair of outlaws who have recently kidnapped a child. Or so it appears. Though Roy (Mr. Shannon) and Lucas (Joel Edgerton) are grim-faced, heavily armed and unnervingly competent, their victim, a boy named Alton (Jaeden Lieberher), doesnt seem afraid of them, and indeed acts more like an accomplice than like prey.The scene shifts quickly to a religious compound that sets off another, equally misleading, set of associations. Here is a stern patriarch (Sam Shepard) flanked by goons in bad suits. Here are platoons of women with long plaited hair and long homespun dresses. Here is the F.B.I., coming in heavy. We might assume that were in the territory of the Branch Davidians or a polygamous quasi-Mormon sect. It seems possible that Alton, who was taken from their midst, was not abducted but rescued.As it turns out  and here the spoiler siren starts to wail in earnest  he isnt a member of the flock at all, but rather its godhead. You get that impression looking into his eyes, especially when tractor beams of bright blue radiance shoot out of them like bolts from Harry Potters wand. His gaze has the power to set walls, grown men and the earth itself atremble.Roy, we learn, is Altons father, and Lucas is an old buddy of Roys who has literally seen the light. The boys disappearance becomes less a matter of religious freedom and pastoral authority than of national security, as a geeky National Security Agency operative (Adam Driver) takes over the case from the law enforcement guys. The boy somehow has access to top-secret codes and coordinates. He becomes a human GPS, tracing a zigzagging route along the picturesque back roads of Texas and Louisiana and pausing to visit his mother, Sarah (Kirsten Dunst), and to pull a satellite out of the sky into a parking lot.Who is this kid supposed to be? Jesus? E. T.? Clark Kent? Edward Snowden? Mr. Nichols, whose fondness for high-stakes boys-adventure stories was especially evident in the Mark Twain-inflected Mud (2013), plays with various allusions and possibilities. He doesnt overdo the self-consciousness, but he knows that the audience has a soft spot for unusual children, whose aura of innocence is a screen for otherworldly powers. Alton could be a boy genius or a musical prodigy. The adults in his life fear for his safety and are also a little afraid of him, and their desire to protect him is mingled with the urge to exploit his gifts.Alton has just been introduced to comic books, which he pores over with scholarly intensity as if they were works of reference rather than fantasy. And in comics, anything can happen. The rules of space, time and narrative order can be redrafted at will, as long as the writers and inkers stay on the right side of the line that separates chaos from coherence. Mr. Nichols has an efficient, naturalistic style. His movies look and sound like Sundance-sourced exercises in regional realism, and he is sensitive to the nuances of feeling that infuse even the strangest circumstances, and also the most ordinary.At its heart, Midnight Special is a parable of parental love, a heartfelt look at the challenges involved in loving and possibly losing an extraordinary child. I like worrying about you, Roy says to Alton at an especially grave and touching moment, and his words are a beautiful and concise summary of a common emotion. The context in which they occur is completely outlandish, and the charm and audacity of this film lie in the way it blends the commonplace and the bizarre.My only real quarrel is with the blandness of the bizarre stuff. What is meant to be a dazzling climax, a flight of visual sublimity, looks a little too much like images pulled from an advertisers dream board or an architects digital sketchpad. Sometimes the best move for a visionary is to keep the visions out of sight. And the surest way to arouse a sense of wonder is to leave us with something to wonder about.Midnight Special is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Rough magic.  Running time: 1 hour 51 minutes."}
{"text": "Readers emailed us their pressing questions on the next steps in the nomination fight over Judge Merrick B. Garland. Here are some answers on whats to come:Q. What is the process to confirm a Supreme Court nominee?A. Typically, the Senate Judiciary Committee would ask Judge Garland to fill out an extensive questionnaire and provide reams of material, including speeches and published academic articles, from his career.Committee lawyers would do an extensive examination of his record. Members of the committee would also sit down with Judge Garland privately and discuss any concerns and question him on his views. The committee would then convene a hearing to question him publicly and also to hear from witnesses supporting and opposing his nomination.After another round of written questions, the committee would eventually vote and could send his nomination to the floor for consideration by the full Senate even if he did not win a committee majority. But Senate Republicans, who control the committees and the floor by virtue of their majority status, have said repeatedly they will take no action on Judge Garlands nomination.Q. Can the Senate bypass the Judiciary Committee, hold hearings of its own and confirm the nominee?A. The Senate could take up the nomination without action by the Judiciary Committee through a vote to bring it directly to the floor. But that is extremely unlikely to happen in this case. The Senate could also debate the nomination on its own, but would not conduct a hearing.Q. Does Senator Mitch McConnell have the singular right of refusal to allow Judge Garland a hearing or vote?A. As the majority leader, Mr. McConnell controls what is happening on the Senate floor. He could be overruled by a majority vote of the Senate, but his Republican colleagues would not cooperate in that effort because that would, in effect, be relinquishing the power of the majority.If Mr. McConnell went against the wishes of a majority of his Republican colleagues, they could try to remove him from leadership. But most Republicans strongly side with him on not taking up the nomination.Q. How long will all of this drag on?A. In the past, it has taken a couple of months from nomination to confirmation. Under normal circumstances, Judge Garland could be on the court by June if he won a Senate vote. But this fight is likely to go on for the rest of the year and into 2017.If Republicans hold to their position not to act, the next president would have to make a nomination after taking office on Jan. 20. Choosing a nominee and getting the Senate to act would again take months, so the court could be without a full complement of judges into mid-2017.Q. How likely is it that Republicans would confirm Judge Garland in a lame-duck session after the election, should a Democrat win?A. A handful of Republicans have publicly raised the idea of confirming him after the election if Democrats win the White House, because Judge Garland is considered a moderate and could be more acceptable to them than anyone picked by Hillary Clinton or Senator Bernie Sanders.Mr. McConnell has said he would not act in a lame duck but it is possible he could change his mind. The likelihood of that occurring is entirely dependent on the election results. Republicans who are against the idea agree that it would run counter to their argument to let the people decide but they might be willing to take the heat if it suits their political purposes.Q. Is it possible to appoint a Supreme Court nominee as a recess appointee?A. Yes it is possible and has been done. But it is unlikely in this case. And to eliminate even the chance of it happening, the Senate intends to meet occasionally in pro forma sessions even when lawmakers are out of town to block President Obama from taking advantage of a recess to make an appointment."}
{"text": "AMSTERDAM  While several bodies of work from the Dutch designer Marcel Wanders can be seen in the solo show Portraits at the Friedman Benda gallery in New York, a more personal collection of his fanciful creations is on display for prospective real estate buyers.Mr. Wanders, 52, is selling his 237-square-meter, or 2,550-square-foot, apartment, complete with custom furnishings, artwork and even design kitchenware, which reflect his joyous, playful aesthetic. The two-bedroom, two-bathroom ground-floor space in the heart of Amsterdam, in the 17th-century Canal Ring district, has an asking price of 1.8 million euros, or about $2 million. It is listed with Engel & Vlkers in Amsterdam.Mr. Wanders, an internationally renowned product, furniture and interior designer, has taken up a peripatetic lifestyle. He spent much of last year in San Francisco and will be in Milan most of this year before going to New York for a spell. Mr. Wanders also designs for architectural projects, including the Mondrian South Beach hotel in Miami and the Andaz Amsterdam Prinsengracht, and is co-founder and artistic director of the design label Moooi, which opened its first United States showroom in New York last year.Fans of his work will recognize several iconic pieces sprinkled throughout the apartment, such as quirky Delft blue ceramics in custom glass cabinets and the five puffy Monster Bar Stools he designed for Moooi lining one side of the sturdy marble island that anchors the open kitchen. Mr. Wanders decided to include the contents in the sale because he views them as essential to the experience of living there.The furniture and lighting is so well placed and much of it was made for the place  they should stay together, Mr. Wanders said. Its more than a space  it really has a character all its own. I assume its going to be great for people to have these things included, maybe someone coming from abroad who is happy that its already organized.When Mr. Wanders bought the apartment in 2005, one of nine in the 110-year-old building along the Keizersgracht (Emperors Canal), he undertook an interior transformation that ended up taking five years to complete.I wanted to make everything perfect, but I think I overdid it a little bit, Mr. Wanders said with a laugh.He gutted the interior, rebuilt rooms, installed several skylights, increased the opening to the small patio and cleverly gave the bedroom views to the living area. Warm red and brown walnut flooring starting in the hallway seamlessly connects all spaces. The first room, off the hallway to the right, is a compact toilet area for guests, a ubiquitous feature in Dutch homes. Not surprisingly, Mr. Wanderss take is a vast departure from the norm, with walls covered with shape-shifting triangles of mirrored glass punctuated with floral lights.The adjoining guestroom displays an elaborately decorated armoire, the Altdeutsche Cabinet designed by the Antwerp firm Studio Job for Moooi, while the wall behind the bed is covered in a quilted textile and studded with cloth flowers in multiple colors. A round window, which can be covered by a curtain, looks out into the living space.Both guest and master baths sport show-stopping walk-in showers. From the ceiling to the marble flooring, their walls shimmer with custom mosaics of Bisazza glass tiles, and they are crowned with sly crystal chandelier overhead showerheads, a line Mr. Wanders designed.I produced them for Bisazza for maybe a year or so, and there are just a few in the world, he said. They have LED lights built into the showerhead. When the water is on, it looks like its raining crystals.Bathing is a prominent theme in the master bedroom  a white oval stand-alone tub with red fixtures sits front and center, under a Delft blue chandelier. The tub can be seen from the hall leading to the kitchen and dining area because in place of a wall, floor-to-ceiling glass divides part of the bedroom, with an option of closing it off with a curtain.I like transparency, Mr. Wanders said. I love to have views throughout the house. If you can really feel the whole space and the light pours in, it becomes an interesting space instead of just square boxes. Also, the bathtub there is just fun. Plus, if youre in a tub and your only view is of a few white tiles, thats boring.The airy main living space is dominated by a sprawling five-piece sectional sofa in quilted white fabric and a concrete table seating 12 in a mix-and-match assortment of Mr. Wanderss chairs. From there, a row of three double doors lead to a small patio.The central living area is a wonderful place to hang out, read books, socialize, Mr. Wanders said. Youve got the daylight coming in in a beautiful way, and in the summer, all the doors are open. And of course you have the backdrop of the mosaic.The mosaic is a masterpiece, a huge enchanted-forest swirl of fantastical creatures custom-designed by the Dutch pop-surrealist Femke Hiemstra. Titled Secret Garden, it runs covers most of the back wall. A row of specially cut skylights bathes the artwork in light.Femke does amazing work  shes in galleries all over the States, Mr. Wanders said. She made a small drawing for me and I had it made into a large mosaic  a magical opportunity. We decided to put hand-cut crystal stones between some of the glass tiles, so it glistens as you walk by. It is something exquisite.The obvious question is, What if someone wants to remove Secret Garden, or anything else?Of course it was made for this place, but, yes, its made in such a way that we can take it out, Mr. Wanders said. For everything, we can have a discussion with the buyer.Regardless of where his possessions end up, he says, its time to move on.Im going to miss my place, but its not great for a house to have no one living in it, he said. Its also healthy to take a distance from things. If you acquire things, you have to let them go. At this moment, Im happy with my one suitcase."}
{"text": "Local prosecutors have historically paid no price for taking up residence in the pocket of the police department. That changed on Tuesday, when Democratic primary voters in the counties that include Cleveland and Chicago turned veteran prosecutors out of office for mishandling cases against police officers who shot and killed black citizens.The defeats of Anita Alvarez, the states attorney of Cook County, Ill., and Tim McGinty, county prosecutor of Cuyahoga County, Ohio, show that many voters are no longer willing to tolerate cover-ups and foot-dragging in cases of killings by the police and other abuses. Still, it will take more than changing the name on the prosecutors stationery to reform the way such cases are handled.That prosecutors and police officers work closely together every day creates a conflict of interest. It makes it difficult for many prosecutors to vigorously pursue cases of police wrongdoing. The best solution would be to bring in special prosecutors to handle all cases where civilians died at the hands of the police. Until that happens, voters need to oust prosecutors who fail to do their jobs.Ms. Alvarez became the object of civic rage when she waited 13 months to charge the police officer who executed 17-year-old Laquan McDonald on a busy Chicago street  despite a police dash-cam video that contradicted the Police Departments statement that the young man had been menacing officers with a knife.The video might have remained buried forever had lawyers and journalists not been tipped off to its existence. Only after a court ordered that it be made public did Ms. Alvarez charge the officer with murder.The protesters who ousted Ms. Alvarez are unlikely to stop there. Kim Foxx, a politically connected former prosecutor who won the Democratic primary, could find herself facing similar pressure if she does not reform how police misconduct cases are handled by the office.A similar backlash materialized in Cleveland after Mr. McGinty asked a grand jury not to indict the police officer who shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who had a toy gun at the time. A 911 caller told an emergency operator that the gun was probably fake and that the boy was probably a juvenile, but that message failed to reach the officer. The officer shot the child within seconds of arriving on the scene, then stood by for several minutes without providing medical assistance. The episode reminded African-Americans yet again that they lived at the mercy of a Police Department that had an utter disregard for black lives.Mr. McGinty behaved more like the police officers defense lawyer than a prosecutor. He also angered the public by speaking disparagingly about Tamir Rices family during the course of the case. Prosecutors in his office even suggested that the officers decision to shoot the child was justified because the boy lived in a violent neighborhood.Many voters were clearly willing to vote for anyone but Mr. McGinty. But in their eagerness to be rid of him, they turned to Michael OMalley, a former prosecutor who worked under Mr. McGintys predecessor when the office was too cozy with the police and riddled with cronyism. Voters who chose Mr. OMalley will need to pay close attention to how he does business.These two elections show the growing influence of the Black Lives Matter movement, as protesters seized on the Rice and McDonald killings and refused to let them go. Two young people were gunned down, and the voters in those grieving communities were not going to let the prosecutors off the hook."}
{"text": "The song of the mourning dove is a melancholy counterpoint to the dazzling chorus of migrant bird calls now just beginning to fill the earliest spring air. At this time of year, even before the snow completely melts, resident doves  those that chose to take their chances on a mild New York City winter  begin their amorous cooing in sobering tones.The mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) is far more common in New York State now than it was at the turn of the 20th century. Warming trends and an expanding winter range mean that mourning doves can now be observed throughout the state, from the Adirondacks to the tip of Montauk Point, year round. This is particularly true in New York City and on Long Island. Annual bird counts indicate that the mourning dove is now one of the most abundant birds in the Empire State.Mourning doves superficially resemble their relatives the rock pigeons, but they are more streamlined, with a smaller head and a longer, tapering tail, sharply bordered by black and white markings. They are an overall warm dun color with subtle, pinkish highlights, matching their small pink feet. Like their pigeon cousins, they are adept at surviving in the company of humans, thriving in cities and suburbs, and making good use of cleared landscapes for feeding, courting and breeding. Doves prefer to feed on the ground, and are often attracted to bird feeders or, even more commonly, the ground beneath the feeders, where they methodically pick up any stray seeds.Though the mourning dove may be known for its grace, a dove nest is a somewhat haphazard construction. The birds begin by assembling a loose platform of small twigs in a tree crotch or forked branch, but will even occasionally choose to nest on ledges or other flat surfaces. The twig platform is then lined with soft grasses and other plant material to protect the eggs. As if aware of the flimsiness of their own work, mourning doves often repurpose abandoned robin or mockingbird nests, topping the original nest with additional materials. Once completed to the dove couples satisfaction, two warm white eggs are deposited in the nest, and both parents dutifully incubate them, the males by day, the females overnight. In about two weeks, the eggs hatch into fast-growing, creamy-white chicks sparsely covered in down. About two weeks after hatching the chicks fledge, leaving the nest to begin their lives as adult mourning doves.From the moment the young birds fly off, the adults set about courting again. Mourning doves mate for life, and they mate often. In New York City, a pair may produce as many as three nests a year between March and October.At this time of year, listen for cooing doves as the sun rises. Their velvety calls are a bass accompaniment to the revelry of red-winged blackbirds, Carolina wrens and cardinals as they welcome spring back to New York City."}

{"text": "The Divergent series  a derivative saga of family, factions and overstressed females  soldiers within sight of the finish line with its third installment, Allegiant. But a story that kicked off two years ago at a reasonable gallop has now slowed to barely a limp.The first film in a two-part finale (the second, Ascendant, is expected next year), Allegiant sends Tris (Shailene Woodley), her brother, Caleb (Ansel Elgort) and her hunky squeeze, Four (Theo James, even more expressionless than usual if thats possible), fleeing from a still-walled-in Chicago. One shower of toxic rain and a blasted landscape later, they wash up at the gleamingly pristine Bureau of Genetic Welfare, where David (a smugly sinister Jeff Daniels) presides over unspecified hanky-panky with the human genome.Spouting biological balderdash with a commendably straight face, David declares Tris pure, a designation that comes with all-white outfits and an all-access pass to Davids private aerie. (This doesnt sit well with Four, who, being damaged, is stuck below, wearing Mad Maxs postapocalyptic castoffs.) Ill-defined and padded with tame special effects, these scenes are so lacking in narrative momentum that we can almost hear the hum of a plot idling in neutral.Tris, too, seems becalmed and unsure, vacillating between Davids professed humanitarianism and Fours insistence that evil is afoot. Ms. Woodley, previously such a strong anchor for a series thats casually dominated by powerful female characters, feels disengaged here and a little tired. And a sidelined Octavia Spencer, playing the leader of the former peace-loving Amity faction  now reborn as a resistance group known as Allegiant  appears similarly detached.A flaccid blend of eugenics, purloined children, memory-wiping gas and laughably unlikely scuffles, Allegiant (directed by Robert Schwentke) offers a weak bridge to the series conclusion. Whether audiences will still be allegiant after crossing it remains to be seen.The Divergent Series: Allegiant is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Body slams and lip locks.

{"text": "Comments are off; see the production note at the end of this post.Updated, 7:10 p.m. |  The climate appears to be changing in American attitudes about global warming.The evidence lies in the graph above from a new Gallup survey. This graph got far less attention this week than a much sharper year-on-year spike in worry and the highest level of belief (in 15 years of tracking) that humans are the main cause.Based on the short-term shifts, some campaigners already say they see a tipping point.Id love to think so, but I wouldnt count on it.Read on for my reasoning.And of course, as other surveys show, theres already plenty of consensus  with no red and blue divide  on climate-smart energy choices and policies. (Read The Conservative Case for Solar Subsidies to learn more.)To me, themore subtle background trend is the significant one to watch because its like the long-term warming of the climate itself.Climate varies and climate changes, as is happening now through the steady buildup of heat trapped by accumulating greenhouse gases. As Ive written countless times, the short-term natural variability in Earths linked oceanic and atmospheric systems has sporadically obscured the background warming, with the recent hiatus (which appears reconfirmed, depending on how its defined) just the latest bump.Heres why I see no social or political tipping point: Behind the ups and downs tracked by Gallup, Pew, The Times and others, theres been little evidenceof a shift in what political and socials scientists call issue salience for global warming  making it the kind of problem citizensbring to the voting booth.Depending on whichquestions are asked, you can always find support for action to stem climate change. A case in point was provided in New York Times/CBS News poll just ahead of the Paris climate talks, which found:Two-thirds of Americans support the United States joining a binding international agreement to curb growth of greenhouse gas emissions.But surveys consistently rank the environment in general, and global warming more specifically, at the bottom of lists of public concerns when people are simply asked to say what worries them.Ill end on an up note, nonetheless, related to the abundant evidence for broad consensus on smart energy steps. A great distillation of this evidence can be seen in a short video report filed by John Sutter of CNN from the heart of skeptic country  Woodward County, Okla.  last summer. I wrote about it here. But you can watch it right here:Update, 6:48 p.m. | Gallup also highlighted another significant new finding related to the mix of energy solutions that could cut greenhouse gas emissions:For the first time since Gallup first asked the question in 1994, a majority of Americans say they oppose nuclear energy. The 54 percent opposing it is up significantly from 43 percent a year ago, while the 44 percent who favor using nuclear energy is down from 51 percent.Im not sure I buy into the pollsters hypothesis for why this is happening even though the big rise in opposition happened five years since the Fukushima nuclear calamity:In 2011, Gallup conducted its annual Environment poll a few days before the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan, and at that time, 57 percent of Americans were in favor of nuclear energy. The next time the question was asked in 2012, a similar majority still favored the use of nuclear energy.And although there have not been any major nuclear incidents since Fukushima in 2011, a majority of U.S. adults now oppose nuclear energy. This suggests that energy prices and the perceived abundance of energy sources are the most relevant factors in attitudes toward nuclear power, rather than safety concerns prompted by nuclear incidents.Lower gasoline prices over the past year are likely driving greater opposition toward the use of nuclear power. As Americans have paid less at the pump, their level of worry about the nations energy situation has dropped to 15-year-low levels. This appears to have resulted in more Americans prioritizing environmental protection and fewer backing nuclear power as an alternative energy source.Could it also be that those most concerned about climate change have become convinced that rapid deployment of renewable energy technologies can rapidly decarbonize energy supplies without splitting atoms?I hope theyre right, but Im convinced all of the above is essential. Theres a rich discussion of this question at Our Energy Policy.Let me know what you think at the links below (again, no comments this time).Production note | Im leaving comments off on this post because Im going to be in Cuba with 16 documentary students and a Pace University colleague until March 27th.

The hatching started on Wednesday night in the first of two eggs in the nest, with one eaglet making significant progress emerging from its shell.The American Eagle Foundation said the adult bald eagle pair  nicknamed Mr. President and the First Lady  were the first to nest in the location, high in a tulip poplar tree at the National Arboretum, which is operated by the Department of Agriculture. The eagles began nesting there in 2014, the first to do so since 1947.The adult eagles are sticking close to the eaglet and its unhatched sibling, sometimes making visibility poor on the video stream. This is a wild eagle nest, and anything can happen, the foundations site warns. Things like sibling rivalry, predators and natural disaster can affect this eagle family and may be difficult to watch.In 1963, bald eagles were close to extinction with just 487 nesting pairs remaining, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. But the population has since recovered and is no longer considered endangered.Watching live footage of birds in their habitat can be both riveting and a test of patience. Long periods can go by with little happening aside from the ruffle of a feather.But for a spell in 2011, New Yorkers were fixated on a webcam showing red-tailed hawks in a nest overlooking Washington Square Park, following a tale of the health and, ultimately, the death of the mother hawk, named Violet.If you are really into watching eggs hatching, here is another webcam to keep an eye on. It shows  a peregrine falcon  in her nest on a ledge on the 41st floor of the Rhodes State Office Tower in Columbus, Ohio.A third egg has just appeared in the nest, the Ohio Department of National Resources said Thursday.

{"text": "WASHINGTON  President Obama nominated Judge Merrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court to help enhance the reputation of an institution whose public approval has dropped substantially in this era of heightened political polarization, he said in an interview with National Public Radio.Judge Garland would help to burnish the sense that the Supreme Court is above politics and not just an extension of politics, and would set a good tone for restoring  or at least increasing  the American peoples confidence in our justice system, Mr. Obama said in an interview with NPRs Nina Totenberg.The interview signaled the start of what is expected to be an aggressive campaign by the White House and outside groups to promote Judge Garland as a peerless jurist who deserves a hearing and a vote on his nomination by the Senate.Republican senators, even those who have expressed admiration for Judge Garland, have vowed to block any selection by Mr. Obama. They argue that the next president should decide who replaces Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last month.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said Thursday that Republicans and Democrats simply disagreed on whether the Senate should consider a Supreme Court nominee in a presidents final year in office, and, so, should move on to other issues. But with polls showing that a clear majority of Americans believe that the Senate should consider a nominee, Democrats said they intend to hammer away at the issue.Mr. Obama said in the interview that he hoped that Judge Garlands obvious qualifications  he is the chief judge of what is widely considered to be the second-most important court in the country  would convince people that he was not using the selection process as a political tool.I said at the outset I would not use this appointment as a political symbol, as a way to score points, as a way to gin up my base, Mr. Obama said. And indeed, some left-leaning groups have expressed disappointment that Mr. Obama did not select a minority candidate.Mr. Obama said he had warned Judge Garland, whom Mr. Obama described as a civilian, that he would face attacks. But he said the judge was at a point in his career when he has the confidence to face down his critics.Mr. Obama warned that if his nominee is not even considered by the Senate because the White House and Senate are controlled by different political parties then at that point the process has broken down.And while Democrats have played politics with Supreme Court selections as well, Mr. Obama argued that the Republicans were now going too far and risked people losing faith in the justice system.At that point, the judiciary becomes a pure extension of politics, he said. And that damages peoples faith in the judiciary  because everybody understands that theres some politics involved in appointing judges, but we also expect that the judicial system can rise above the political process.In late 2009, according to Gallup polling, 61 percent of Americans approved of the job the Supreme Court was doing. In late 2015, the most recent survey found that 50 percent disapproved and 45 percent approved."}
{"text": "PHOENIX  When Donald J. Trump campaigns in Arizona, he talks up the endorsements he has received from Jan Brewer, the former governor who signed some of the nations toughest immigration laws, and Sheriff Joe Arpaio, whose aggressive pursuit of illegal immigrants has prompted discrimination charges by the Justice Department.When Bernie Sanders campaigned here on Monday, he ceded the stage to a teenage girl, who spoke of her parents arrest in a raid by Sheriff Arpaio and the reprieve from deportation they received from the federal government.And in ads airing across the state this week  his in English, hers in Spanish  Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton deliver opposing messages: Mr. Cruz vows to undo executive actions by President Obama delaying the deportation of certain undocumented immigrants, while Mrs. Clinton promises to stop deporting parents whose children are citizens of the United States.The presidential race has moved to Arizona  a state at the center of the nations battle over immigration  and each side is using the issue to try to woo a deeply divided electorate ahead of Primary Day on Tuesday.Were not just at the center of the immigration discussion, Tyler Bowyer, chairman of the Republican Party of Maricopa County, the states most populous, said in an interview. The border is our backyard. We live the challenges of immigration every single day.Arizona is a state in demographic transition. Latinos are poised to become the majority, and they already account for the largest number of students in public schools. But the state is also a magnet for retirees, and older white residents play an outsize role in elections and tilt the state to the right.Republicans control every statewide office and both chambers of the Legislature. There are currently several anti-immigration measures under consideration in the Legislature, and on Thursday, people who oppose these measures staged a protest at the office of Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican who has not made his position on the bills known.In many ways, Arizonas political battles over immigration predicted the tensions and divisions that are defining the presidential election. Mr. Trump is a prime example, with his promises to build a wall at the border and make Mexico pay for it. The states Latino population swelled to 2.5 million last year from 440,000 in 1980, while the share of white residents has steadily declined.Sheriff Arpaio stepped up raids as conservative legislators pushed bills that imposed heavy sanctions on employers who hire undocumented immigrants and expanded the legal definition of identity theft to include anyone seeking employment without proper documentation.Then, in 2010, Ms. Brewer signed the show me your papers law, which gave the police broad powers to question anyone suspected of being in the country illegally. It fueled national protests and boycotts, but also helped her win a second term, creating two images of Arizona: to some, a synonym for intolerance; to others, an example of how fed-up citizens and elected officials could fight back against illegal immigration.Representative Ruben Gallego, a Democrat from Phoenix, said in an interview, Our immigration laws have been a very effective tool to mobilize the right, and its once again going to reward a politician whos going to be preying on peoples anxieties, be it Cruz or Trump.Today, the state has fewer undocumented immigrants than it did in 2009, according to an analysis by the Pew Hispanic Center. And based on census numbers, scholars at the Morrison Institute for Public Policy at Arizona State University projected that four in five of the states Latino residents will be a United States citizen by 2030.Apprehensions by the Border Patrol have been on the decline, falling by 25 percent in the last fiscal year alone, in part because Mexicos improved economy has given fewer of its citizens reason to risk the perilous crossing.Still, profound challenges remain, fueled by geography  the border between Arizona and Mexico runs for about 370 miles  and opportunity. This month, Border Patrol agents arrested a convicted sex offender who had previously been deported as well as a man wanted for murder in Maricopa County as they tried to enter the country illegally.People are angry, theyre upset, Ms. Brewer said in an interview. The heartache and the loss and the suffering of people who have been harmed by illegal immigrants who come across our border is very real.In 2011, the Justice Department accused Sheriff Arpaio of engaging in unconstitutional policing by unfairly targeting Latinos and demanding proof of citizenship. Two years later, a federal judge, G. Murray Snow of United States District Court in Phoenix, ruled that he and his deputies had systematically violated the constitutional rights of Latinos by targeting them during raids and traffic stops.But Mr. Arpaio is unrepentant. He said that of the 8,600 undocumented immigrants his office had turned over to federal immigration authorities after their arrests for felony and misdemeanor crimes in the past two years, 3,000 had returned to county jails. The reason, he said, is not that theyre all running back across the border, is that the federal government is releasing them back onto our streets.Mr. Cruzs television ad here features Steve Ronnebeck of Mesa, Ariz., whose 21-year-old son, Grant, was killed last year during a robbery at a convenience store. An illegal immigrant with a criminal record who was out on bond awaiting deportation is charged with murder in the case. The ad denounces Mr. Obamas executive actions on immigration.I hope I get to be there the day President Cruz tears up those illegal executive actions instituted by President Obama, Mr. Ronnebeck says in the ad.Mrs. Clintons TV ad  titled Valenta, which in Spanish means courage  opens with split-screen images of Mr. Trump and Mr. Arpaio and a narrator declaring, When it looks like everyone is against you, learn who is your best friend.Mr. Trumps pledge to build a wall continues to be his most popular applause line at his rallies here. By contrast, Mr. Sanders, who spent much of the week traveling the state, accused Sheriff Arpaio of using un-American and uncivilized law enforcement tactics against Latinos.A Merrill poll of likely voters in Arizona conducted this month showed Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump tied if they were to face off in the general election, and Mr. Cruz with a six-point advantage over Mrs. Clinton. In a matchup between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, Mr. Sanders holds a three-point edge. The polls margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points.The only remaining candidate who has not campaigned in Arizona is John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, who nonetheless received the endorsement of the states leading newspaper, The Arizona Republic, on Friday.In an election year dominated by threats and put-downs, the newspapers editorial board wrote of Mr. Kasich, the most understated candidate is the most competent."}
{"text": "INDIAN WELLS, Calif.   Novak Djokovic dominated both tiebreakers to beat Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (2), at the BNP Paribas Open on Friday, setting up a semifinal against Rafael Nadal featuring two players who own a combined seven titles in the California desert.Nadal defeated Kei Nishikori, 6-4, 6-3, connecting on 89 percent of his first serves in a match played in 91-degree heat under a relentless sun. Nadal is a three-time winner at Indian Wells.Serena Williams rallied after squandering a 3-0 lead in the second set to beat Agnieszka Radwanska, 6-4, 7-6 (1), and reach the final for the first time since 2001, when she won before boycotting the event for 14 years.Williams hit 41 winners and had 29 unforced errors to 18 winners and just 10 unforced errors by Radwanska, who fell to 0-10 in her career against Williams, the worlds top-ranked player.Radwanska had chances to break Williams in the fifth and seventh games of the first set, when she led, 3-1. But Williams earned breaks in two of the last three games to take the set, smacking a forehand winner off Radwanskas second serve on the last point.Trailing, 3-0, in the second, Radwanska won three straight games to tie it up. Williamss backhand volley went to the side, giving Radwanska a 6-5 lead. But Williams hit a forehand crosscourt winner on the run to tie it at 6-6, forcing the tiebreaker, which she won with another forehand.Victoria Azarenka faced Karolina Pliskova in the other womens semifinal.Djokovic crushed Nadal, 6-1, 6-2, to win the Qatar Open in January in one of the most lopsided matches in their long rivalry, which Djokovic leads, 24-23.Its a game of cat and mouse, in a way, mentally, who is going to be on top first, Djokovic said.Shadows had begun creeping onto the main stadium court by the time Djokovic outlasted Tsonga, who has lost to Djokovic, the worlds top-ranked player, in 13 of their last 14 meetings. Djokovic, a four-time champion at Indian Wells, improved to 20-1 this year heading into Saturdays match against Nadal, who is 12-4.Djokovic capitalized on a slew of errors by Tsonga in the first tiebreak. Djokovic was leading, 3-1, when Tsonga reeled off three straight errors, including two off his forehand that extended Djokovics lead to 6-1. Tsonga was down, 6-2, and serving to stay in the tiebreak, but he netted a backhand to lose it.Djokovic led, 5-4, in the second set and had two match points on Tsongas serve in the 10th game. But Tsonga pulled out a big serve to hold at 5-5. Tsonga came up with another crucial hold at 6-6 with a forehand winner and another serve that Djokovic could not handle, forcing another tiebreak.Leading, 6-2, Djokovic closed out the match on his second serve, which Tsonga returned wide.He didnt give one point in those tiebreaks, which was not my case, Tsonga said.Nadal trailed, 3-1, before winning five of the next six games to take the opening set in 45 minutes. He got an early break in the second to build a 4-2 lead. He made a forehand error that allowed Nishikori to break back and trail, 4-3. But Nadal quickly recovered in the next game to break Nishikori and won the match on his serve with a forehand down the line.He started so quick, hitting all the balls very well, very aggressive, and serving great, Nadal said. Then he started to miss some first serves, and I was returning very well the second-set serve, returning very aggressive. That was so important.The resurgent Nadal has reached one final  losing to Djokovic in Doha  and three semis this year."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   After a judge ordered a Guantnamo Bay prisoner freed because the evidence that he was a Qaeda member was too thin, the government appealed the ruling to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. But as the detainees lawyers prepared to argue the case in January 2011, they had reason to hope that they might prevail again.For one thing, the government had dropped several of its arguments for why their client was probably a wartime enemy, further weakening its case that he was not the innocent he claimed to be. For another, the three-judge panel included one of the appeals courts few Democratic appointees, Merrick B. Garland, who is now a Supreme Court nominee.But just 22 seconds after one of the detainees lawyers began arguing that only tattered remnants remained of the governments case against his client, Judge Garland interrupted him. Just because they had really strong arguments that they are not now using doesnt mean the ones that are left are not pretty strong, he declared.Judge Garlands panel went on to rule that the governments evidence was good enough to keep holding the man after all. The judges vote was part of a pattern: As one wartime detention case after another has pitted state security powers against individual rights, he has often  though not always  deferred to the government.That pattern is part of the reason Judge Garland is seen as a moderate, an image that serves as ammunition as President Obama tries to shame Republican senators who say they will not even give him a hearing. It is also the reason lawyers who have represented Guantnamo Bay detainees  and some liberals for whom Guantnamo is a core issue  have had a mixed reaction to the choice.Judge Garland  a former prosecutor who oversaw the investigation into the Oklahoma City bombing before President Bill Clinton appointed him to the bench  was assigned in late 2002 to the first appellate panel that reviewed a Guantnamo detainee lawsuit. The administration of President George W. Bush had brought the first Afghanistan war prisoners to the American military base in Cuba early that year.In that case, Judge Garland and two Republican-appointed judges agreed in 2003 with the Bush administration that federal courts had no jurisdiction to hear such cases, dismissing the lawsuit. The Supreme Court later overturned their decision.Thomas B. Wilner, one of the lawyers who brought that case, recalled being disappointed by Judge Garlands ruling. But, echoing several other detainee lawyers, he also said he has known the judge for decades and respects him as fair-minded.Everyone has predilections, but he tries to decide things fairly and not based on ideology, Mr. Wilner said. I wouldnt call him pro-government. He certainly is concerned about these things and listens to the governments arguments very seriously and is inclined to give them weight.In his next Guantnamo case, Judge Garland did rule against the government. In 2008, he was part of a panel that rejected a military tribunals decision that a certain detainee was an enemy combatant, and so lawfully detainable. The tribunal had made that decision even though the government had refused to show it or the court secret evidence for its claims.To affirm the Tribunals determination under such circumstances would be to place a judicial imprimatur on an act of essentially unreviewable executive discretion, Judge Garland wrote.But that 2008 ruling was an outlier.From 2010 to 2012, the appeals court systematically turned back habeas corpus cases brought by detainees, instructing lower-court judges to use more government-friendly standards for interpreting ambiguous evidence. Judge Garland was not on the panels that developed the early key precedents, but he embraced and applied them without objection.Among the detainees he voted to permit the government to keep in prison were a Kuwaiti, three Afghans and five Yemenis. In 2012, for example, he wrote an opinion upholding the detention of a Yemeni, noting that our appeals court precedents foreclosed all of the legal arguments the detainees lawyer was making.Judge Garland was hardly alone: No detainee won a release order at the appeals court level. Still, he voted differently from the other two Democratic appointees who were on the court at the time, David S. Tatel and Judith Ann Wilson Rogers, in a 2011 case.That was an appeal to the full court of a panel ruling that detainees could not challenge government decisions to transfer them to a country where the detainees believed they would be in danger. Judge Garland was part of the majority, which declined to rehear the case. Judges Tatel and Rogers joined a dissent.And in 2011, Judge Tatel dissented from a panel decision that reversed yet another district court judges order to free a detainee. He lamented that the appeals court was giving too much credence to questionable government claims. Judge Garland wrote no equivalent dissent in the cases that came before him.Indeed, in another 2011 case, Judge Garland wrote an opinion upholding the detention of an Afghan based on evidence the government was keeping secret at the time from the detainees lawyers, although judges saw it. But the government appears to have since changed its mind about the credibility of that evidence.Court documents show that the government later provided unspecified information to the Afghans legal team, which used it to ask a district court judge to reopen the case. The government then voluntarily repatriated the Afghan. But his lawyers are still asking the judge to rule that their client had never been lawfully detainable in the first place to correct a substantial injustice related to the previously withheld information.J. Wells Dixon, a lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights who is helping to represent the Afghan, said that Judge Garland has been too deferential to the government, calling the secret-evidence case particularly troubling.Fallout from the appeals courts skeptical approach to habeas cases led to one more notable ruling. It started when a Yemeni detainee killed himself. A district court judge had ordered him freed, but the appeals court reversed that ruling. (Judge Garland was not on that panel.)After concluding that the detainee had overdosed on pills hoarded in his underwear, the military began requiring guards to search detainees groins for contraband whenever the prisoners left their cells.To avoid the indignity, some detainees stopped going to meetings with their lawyers, and a judge ordered that the practice be halted. But an appellate panel overturned his ruling, calling the practice reasonable.That panel included Judge Garland."}
{"text": "The Ramones self-titled first album came out in April 1976, and by sales standards alone it was a flop, reaching only No. 111 on the Billboard chart.But with its raw sound and extremely bare songwriting style, Ramones became a founding document of punk rock. For its 40th anniversary, the album is being celebrated with an expanded reissue due this summer from Rhino Records and an exhibition, Hey! Ho! Lets Go: Ramones and the Birth of Punk, opening at the Queens Museum on April 10.None of the original band members  Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee and Tommy Ramone  survive, but some of the people involved in making the first album recently recalled the early days of the band and its rushed but calculated time in the studio. Here are edited excerpts from their comments.Formed in 1974 in Forest Hills, Queens, the Ramones  named for a pseudonym once used by Paul McCartney (Paul Ramon)  dressed in leather jackets and ripped jeans, and began to make a name for their chaotic, lightning-fast shows at CBGB.SEYMOUR STEIN (co-founder, Sire Records) They had a special gig for me, but I had the flu. So the next day, I rented a rehearsal studio for an hour. In 20 minutes, they had gone through about 20 songs. I fell in love with them.CRAIG LEON (producer) Until we made the record, they literally hadnt rehearsed how to end songs.STEIN Joey was so sweet; the songs he wrote were so tender. Dee Dee was Dee Dee. Tommy was the brains. Johnny was the Paul McCartney of the group; he was the one who held the band together.MICKEY LEIGH (brother of Joey Ramone; uncredited backup vocals) John was dominant. My brother was easily intimidated, as John knew, but he had his talent.DANNY FIELDS (co-manager) They loved the Bay City Rollers. Dee Dees favorite band was Abba. They were trying to be Abba. They were hoping to have an album that would sell six million copies so they could retire for life.In February 1976, shortly after being signed to Sire, the band spent less than a week in Plaza Sound Studios, a cavernous space above Radio City Music Hall where Arturo Toscanini had once rehearsed the NBC Symphony and where the Rockettes still practiced.LEON I got us four days in the studio and a long weekend to mix the record. My budget was $6,400.FIELDS Relative to the amount of time, money and effort that went into a standard album in the mid-70s, it was so short as to be mythically concise.LEON Im glad it sounded raw at first listen, but it was calculated to be that way. We used the best equipment we possibly could. Every kind of mike we used on the Ramones, I later used at Abbey Road on the London Symphony Orchestra.There was a lot of studio trickery. There are several songs where there is much more than one guitar. There is a triangle on I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend. We overdubbed a bomb sound on Havana Affair. Its a tom-tom drum tuned very low and held under a piano, with someone holding the sustain pedal down so that it would ring when something hit it.LEIGH That was me and Tommy, doing the fuse and bomb.ROB FREEMAN (engineer) Craig wanted it to sound like an early Beatles record.LEON Artificial tape delay was a technique perfected by the Beatles to slightly change the pitch so that it sounds like two people singing along on the same part: If you listen to It happened once before , and then Hey, little girl, I wanna be your boyfriend, its the same effect.LEIGH Tommy wanted to have a fidelity that would be competitive with what was coming out in that period. John didnt want it to be slick.FREEMAN When you asked them what key theyre in or could you tune that up a little bit, they just werent interested. If you asked them to play it up an octave, they would just play it exactly the same way.LEON Tommy played to a modification of what we now have as a click track. It was a little metronome that would click, and a little orange light would go off. He turned off the click sound and put it right in front of the drum kit, with him staring at the light like a robot. He would count off with sticks and then Dee Dee would go, One, two, three, four!, and theyd start.During the sessions, Mr. Stein objected to the lines Im a Nazi, baby in the song Today Your Love, Tomorrow the World. The band changed the line (but kept another Nazi reference), though today those involved disagree about exactly what happened.STEIN It was shocking to me, Im sorry. Im a Jewish kid from Brooklyn.LEIGH Seymour got them to change the words. It was almost a deal breaker. I was not offended by it. I thought it was kind of a perfect way to portray the mind-set of a Nazi youth. It was funny.STEIN The strongest language I could have used was Wait a minute, something like that. Its greatly exaggerated.It took 38 years for Ramones to go gold, but the albums influence has been incalculable. Hey, ho! Lets go! from Blitzkrieg Bop, for example, has become a sports stadium chant around the world. Mr. Leon, who later built an extensive career in classical music, once shared the Ramones music with another famous artist he worked with: Luciano Pavarotti.STEIN I got hate mail. The manager of two of my bands threatened to sue me if I didnt drop the Ramones.FIELDS When youre in the middle of it, you cant see that youre making the revolution. You go to Kansas City, and there are kids saying, You changed my life. Thats gratifying. It will not make you rich overnight, but the influence was immense.LEIGH That didnt happen until decades later, when bands like Soundgarden and Green Day started alluding to them as being their inspiration.LEON Sometime around 2000, we were hanging out at Lucianos house in Pesaro, drinking wine. He started singing football songs from Modena, his hometown, and said he would love to make an album of football songs.I said, Let me sing you an American football song by a band I recorded. I took the guitar and sang Blitzkrieg Bop: Theyre forming in a straight line, going through a tight wind.He said: This is great! Its like football formation. I taught him the song, and he was singing Hey, ho! Lets go!"}
{"text": "Getting eliminated early as host of a global championship is bad enough, but one thing that can make it worse is when it happens at the hand of your bitterest rival. Thats the prospect facing India as it plays Pakistan in the World Twenty20 in Kolkata, India, on Saturday.India already lost its first match of the tournament against New Zealand Tuesday, when it was bowled out for only 79 runs. Pakistan, meanwhile, opened with a victory over Afghanistan.India will not be eliminated if it loses Saturday, but would need to win its two remaining pool matches against Australia and Afghanistan, and for other results to break in its favor, to have any chance of progressing as one of the top two from the five-team pool.This is not what either Indias vast cricketing public, or the oddsmakers who made it a clear favorite, expected. But World T20s are hard to predict.If you look at the World T20 events that happened before, none of the teams that won were thought of as favorites before the event began, said Pakistans coach, Waqar Younis, before the tournament. If you play well in those three weeks, you can win the cup.One reason for this is that while franchise-based T20 events are proliferating around the leading cricketing nations, international matches in the short format remain a comparative rarity. India has played 16 T20 matches since losing in the 2014 final to Sri Lanka, compared with 43 one-day internationals. West Indies, the winner in 2012, has played eight T20s and 21 one-day tests over the same time.Few international sporting rivalries carry greater baggage than India versus Pakistan, and this meeting has had the usual share of external worries. Security concerns placed doubts over Pakistans participation in the tournament, and led to Saturdays match being moved from Dharamsala to Kolkata, formerly called Calcutta, after the regions chief minister said he could not ensure that there would be adequate security in Dharamsala.Sunil Gavaskar, a former India star batsman, has suggested this works in Pakistans favor since it played its opener and a practice match in Kolkata.So though India are the home side, it is Pakistan who are more aware of the conditions, he told the Indian broadcaster NDTV. And it would be an advantage going into Saturdays match.Gavaskar also warned that Indias batsmen should beware of Pakistans pace bowler Mohammad Amir, who has looked highly effective since his return to international cricket following a five-year ban.He has been able to swing the ball back to the batsmen, something that the other left-handers have not been able to do, Gavaskar said.If Amir, still only 23, does dominate Saturday, it will be a break with the first few days of the tournament, in which veteran batsmen shone. Pakistans captain Shahid Afridi and West Indian opener Chris Gayle, both 36, played match-winning innings, as did the 39-year-old Sri Lankan Tillakaratne Dilshan.Gayle produced a performance in keeping with his reputation as the most dangerous player in T20 when he scored 100 runs, including 11 boundary-clearing hits for six, from only 47 deliveries against England. It made Englands total of 182, usually a formidable score, look a simple target, and West Indies won with 11 balls to spare.I think he is up there with Sir Viv in the way he tears apart attacks, said the West Indies coach, Phil Simmons, referring to Viv Richards, widely regarded as the greatest ever West Indian batsman.All three of the veterans have captained their country in test cricket, but Gayle played his last five-day international in 2014, Dilshan in 2013 and Afridi in 2010.The proliferation of franchise-based competitions means T20 can offer a lucrative living for veterans who no longer want to deal with the demands of the five-day game. There are also players who fit T20 better than the longer formats.The England team that lost to West Indies contained only three players  Joe Root, Moeen Ali and Ben Stokes  who are regulars in five-day tests. There are also players like the West Indian spin bowler Samuel Badree, whose career has been defined by the short game.Badree, 35, took only 14 wickets in first-class cricket for Trinidad and Tobago, but was a World T20 winner with West Indies in 2012, topped the world rankings in the format in 2014 and has played overseas in T20 competitions in India, Bangladesh, Australia and Pakistan.The tournament should offer some familiar subplots as the perennial underachiever South Africa and the persistent overachiever New Zealand seek their first global championships, Afghanistan aims to crack crickets world order and the consistent contender Sri Lanka goes after its sixth final appearance in nine World Cup and World T20 tournaments held since 2007.And dont rule out India yet, either. Of five previous winners, including India in the first-ever tournament in 2007, only Sri Lanka in 2014 won its first match. It may be quick cricket to some observers, but in World T20s, coming slow out of the blocks often equates to a fast finish."}
{"text": "ST. LOUIS   After Syracuse beat Dayton, 70-51, on Friday, several of the Oranges coaches watched the Midwest Region game between No. 15-seeded Middle Tennessee State and No. 2-seeded Michigan State at Scottrade Center. They knew they would be playing the winner.And so when Middle Tennessee State won, setting up a matchup Sunday against Syracuse, Griff Hopkins, the adolescent son of the Syracuse assistant Mike Hopkins, turned to another Syracuse assistant, Adrian Autry, and said, Its going to be a long night.After all, No. 10-seeded Syracuse (20-13) could not possibly have already prepared for a team that had just pulled off one of the biggest upsets in N.C.A.A. history. Right?Wrong.No, man, its done, Autry told Griff Hopkins.The N.C.A.A. tournament requires teams that win their first game to play again with just a day of preparation. Losing means an end to your season.Which is why, when the bracket came out last Sunday, Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim assigned one assistant to scout Michigan State and another  Autry  to begin to prepare for the Blue Raiders (25-9).We come in and both guys prepare like were going to play that team, up until the games over, Boeheim said Saturday.To Boeheim and Autry, the practice seemed as natural as breathing.When a fan hears a coach or a player say that a team is just taking it one game at a time or that a competitor was a really good team, with weapons that can beat you, an eye roll is all but a reflex.But as Syracuse prepares to play a team that few people outside Murfreesboro, Tenn., expected would be playing in the tournaments second round  and probably few in that town, near Nashville  it is worth considering that coaches repeat those truisms because they believe them.Autry said he did not see scouting Middle Tennessee State as a moot assignment last Sunday night.I went upstairs, got right back on the computer and just started getting after it, he said.What he found was what the rest of the world saw in Middle Tennessee States 90-81 victory over the Spartans: The Blue Raiders, this seasons Conference USA champion, were for real.After Day 2 or Day 3 of watching tape, I said, You know what? This team  the seeding may be a little off,  Autry said.Boeheim, too, seemed to have figured this out. I had talked to a pro scout, he said, and he had told me, and some people had told him, that this was a very, very good team. And when you watch them play, its pretty obvious.As evidenced in their 55.9 field-goal percentage against Michigan States stout defense, the Blue Raiders have several sharpshooters. On defense, they are aggressive and deploy multiple looks.Weve played against all those defenses, Autry said, but, he added, I dont think weve played against a team that actually plays all those defenses in one game.Doyin Akintobi-Adeyeye, a reserve sophomore forward for the Orange, compared Middle Tennessee States physical defense to Pittsburghs and likened its penchant for 3-pointers to Florida States. Syracuse went 1-4 against Pittsburgh and Florida State, Atlantic Coast Conference rivals, including in the conference tournament.We just pay attention to everybody, Akintobi-Adeyeye said. You have to respect everybody. It is the tournament."}
{"text": "It was one of those hot winter days on Cape Verde, and I had been working outside since the early-morning hours. By the time noon came around, my scalp was so hot that I could have fried an egg on it. I was hoping to finish a construction job quickly, but I decided it was time for a break.Nothing was happening anyway  the fact that all the people stop what they are doing in the middle of the day makes solid sense. Its not because these people dont like to work, as foreign employers like to say. It is simply impossible to do so when the sun stares you down. She wins.Heat aside, I was short of nails. To finish my project, a septic tank, I needed to make molds for concrete to be poured into. Something that I imagined to be an easy task, finding nails, had turned into quite the challenge.I am originally from So Vicente, Cape Verde, and my family immigrated to Portugal when I was 11. For a long time I have returned to the islands at least once a year, usually for a few months over the winter. Cape Verde used to be poor, really poor, and only over the last 10 years or so have things started to change. Now there is big-time tourism on the islands, which brings money (for some) and jobs. I dont say it brings prosperity, because it doesnt, really. It allows people to get by, to survive, but lifes not easy for them. Most of the people on this island, Boa Vista, live in the barracas, a slumlike area close to the main town. They go to work in fancy uniforms and come home to shacks with no running water or reliable electricity.To a tourists eye, the island may seem European, modern and rich, but its off the coast of Africa, after all. It has very few resources. Most of its supplies are imported, and lots of times, because of the bad weather, the boat, as they call it, doesnt arrive to bring things, sometimes for days.Well, I needed nails, and hadnt been able to find any. I decided to go for a stroll, despite the heat. I was walking down the street, trying to stay in the shade, when I heard music. A young guy was playing guitar, and he, too, was apparently taking a break from work: Next to him I saw some unfinished turtle sculptures that he had been carving out of stone. He must know where to get nails because he makes things, I thought.Oi, I greeted him, I am looking for nails. Do you know where to find some?He stopped playing and looked me in the eye. Sure. Wait here. Ill be back.I sat down in his shady spot and looked at the half-finished turtles. After a little while he came back carrying a box. It was full of nails. Many of them were rusty, some were bent, certainly used, but there were enough good ones. I thanked him and gave him 500 escudos (about $5) for the box. He picked up his guitar and started playing his songs again. I stayed on to listen until the heat became more bearable, then I went on my way. Now that I had what I needed, I continued working on the mold, using up most of the nails I received. I worked until late that evening, then went to bed.The next morning I heard someone call me with a certain urgency: Benjamim, Benjamim! It was my neighbor from a few doors away. Benjamim, the nails you received yesterday. Yes? I asked with surprise. They were mine. I am sorry, but I need them. So the box hadnt belonged to the guitar player!Well, I am sorry, too, I replied. But its too late! I used them already. I gave him 500 escudos, hoping he would know how to find what he needed, and anyway, there was nothing else I could do.But right there I learned a lesson about how things work on the island. This is how people adapt. Whether the economic growth continues or not, in the end it is all about resources  and, most important, where to find them.Im a quick learner. One day after that I needed a wheelbarrow, and so I went for a walk. Not in the immediate neighborhood, but a little farther away, toward where the bigger hotels are constructed. Sure enough, I saw a huge building that had been abandoned for years. In 2008, when the crisis and recession hit Europe, lots of projects here came to a halt, and many have stayed that way since. This building must have been one of them. I walked around for a few minutes, snooping. It was odd; it felt as if I were in a time bubble, with all things suspended around me, as if everyone had gone to lunch and then forgotten to come back.There, by an unfinished gate, leaned a wheelbarrow against a pile of bricks. I looked left, looked right and then walked away with it. I dont dress like a regular construction worker, so I just steered it down the street as if I owned it. Thats right: I nicked it. But I managed to finish the job."}
{"text": "There are probably young actors today who look back a short distance to a performance by David Tennant  playing the Doctor in Doctor Who, or Alec Hardy in Broadchurch, or Kilgrave in Jessica Jones  as a formative influence on their work and career. Mr. Tennant, 44, looks back a bit further, to the late 1980s, when the Royal Shakespeare Company brought Hamlet to Glasgow with Mark Rylance in the title role.It was life-changing, Mr. Tennant said during an interview in New York late last year. I was so blown away that back I went to see it on the Saturday matinee before they left again. Because I couldnt believe it was so vivid and so extraordinary.American theatergoers will have the opportunity to assess Mr. Tennants own theater work, and perhaps be blown away by it, when he makes his United States stage debut with the Royal Shakespeare Company in Richard II at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Part of a production of the tetralogy known as the Henriad  Richard II plus Shakespeares three Henry plays  it will run in repertory from Thursday, March 24, through April 29.Mr. Tennant, who is Scottish, is known in America for his work in popular science fiction, mystery and superhero television series, but his roots in theater run deep. He first joined the Royal Shakespeare Company as a 25-year-old in 1996, playing Touchstone in As You Like It and later Romeo in Romeo and Juliet. The performances at the Academy of Music commemorate the 400th anniversary of Shakespeares death but also the 20th anniversary of Mr. Tennants Royal Shakespeare debut.It has a certain symmetry to it, doesnt it? he said. A company Im involved with on so many levels, really, and its been such a huge part of my life.Film and TV work increasingly pulled Mr. Tennant away from the stage in the early 2000s. But Gregory Doran, who had directed him in Tom Stoppards The Real Inspector Hound at the Royal Shakespeare in 1998, drew him back in 2008 with an offer he couldnt refuse.I said to him, Anyone who can play the romantic Romeo and the almost impenetrable Touchstone should be able to play Hamlet, Mr. Doran said recently by phone from Hong Kong, where the Henry plays were being performed before their visit to Brooklyn. That 2008 production  featuring another stage-and-TV star, Patrick Stewart  was a critical and popular success and paved the way for their collaboration on Mr. Dorans Henriad cycle, first performed in Britain in 2013.Reviewing the original British production of Richard II in The New York Times, Ben Brantley wrote: Mr. Tennant has always registered as a slightly alien presence, rather like a more rarefied Johnny Depp. This suits the portrayal of a doomed, disastrously sheltered 14th-century monarch.Joseph V. Melillo, the executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, saw Mr. Tennants performance for the first time recently, on video. Theres a kind of gentleness in his acting, his interpretation, that you dont often see, he said by phone a few days later. Its not the kind of bravura physicality, its much more internalized and soft. Its fascinating.Sheltered because he took the throne at the age of 10, Richard II was deposed at 32 and died in captivity the following year; Shakespeares play covers the last two years of his life.If you are in a world where the divine right of kings is a thing, and as a child youre told, God has chosen you to lead these people, and youre then surrounded by acquiescence and adulation, what does that do to you? Mr. Tennant asked. How does that form the man you become? Thats what fascinates me about trying to find a center for who this character was.One of the things about Mr. Tennants portrayal that drew the most notice in Britain  and will be on display again in Brooklyn  was Richards cascading hair. (Accomplished with extensions in the original production, the do will be a wig this time around.) It was a choice in keeping with his rarefied approach to the character.I liked the idea that he would alight on something he found rather beautiful, Mr. Tennant said. Hes an aesthete. If he found it rather glorious, thered be no one to challenge that it was wrong or unacceptable or not what men did. From that, we got the idea that he would have gold leaf on his fingernails. It was looking for a few things that would set him apart, because he could. Because no one would tell him he couldnt.Sitting for an interview in a Manhattan hotel bar, a pot of tea at his elbow, Mr. Tennant was in town doing publicity for the Netflix series Jessica Jones, which had been released a few days earlier. (His villainous character, Kilgrave, possesses powers of mind control and is obsessed with the heroine.) Just before that he had taken part in his first read-through for the revival of Richard II, nearly two years after the British production closed.Bits of it are all there intact, he said. And other bits, its like Ive never seen them before. My wife made a very good analogy, that its like stripping wallpaper. Some bits just come off in a wonderful sort of pass, they just fall off the wall. And other bits, you have to pick away at for days.Mr. Doran, who praised Mr. Tennant as the most professional of actors  You never catch David dropping a line, even  was not at all worried about his ability to slide back into the role. Asked what Mr. Tennant brought to the character of Richard II in particular, he said: He was unafraid of, which I think was fantastic, the fact that for three acts of the play hes almost intolerable. He behaves in a capricious, vain way, and it isnt really until he gets to the abdication that the mans humanity comes through. And I thought David caught that particularly well.Mr. Tennants own selection of great Richards included Derek Jacobis, Fiona Shaws and, more recently, Ben Whishaws, in the BBC-PBS series of filmed adaptations called The Hollow Crown.Just before I was going to do it, someone gave me a copy, and I said, Ill watch this. I should never have done that. Because Ben Whishaw is an extraordinary actor. And he does it beautifully, in ways I could never even aspire to.In Brooklyn, appearing in just Richard II, Mr. Tennant will be doing only a couple of shows a week. But theres no rest for this international star: On April 23, between performances in Brooklyn, hell fly back to Stratford-upon-Avon to host a live Royal Shakespeare Company broadcast marking the anniversary of Shakespeares death.After Doctor Who, Mr. Tennant starred in the wildly popular British murder drama Broadchurch and its much less popular, short-lived American adaptation, Gracepoint. A third season of Broadchurch is finally to be filmed this summer.He has also somehow found the time to revisit the character who continues to define his career, recording a series of Doctor Who audio dramas scheduled for broadcast in May.It was surprisingly easy to slip back into that time, he said. It could have felt more awkward than it did.Mr. Tennants continuous run on the show ended in 2010, but he has no trouble acknowledging that no matter how many Shakespearean roles he takes on, hell never shake the time-and-space-traveling Doctor.I often say that the first line of the obituary has been written, because Doctor Who has such a reach, he said. Its so loved and noticed, its part of the cultural furniture. To be associated with that show, itll be hard to do anything that reduces the impact of that. Which Im fine with, by the way."}
{"text": "COLOMBIA  About a quarter-million children in Colombia have been displaced by fighting in the past three years of peace negotiations between the government and the countrys leading guerrilla group, the United Nations said in a report released Saturday.Roughly 1,000 Colombian children were used or recruited by nonstate armed combatants during the same period, according to the report by Unicef, the United Nations Childrens Fund.The report also said roughly 200 children were killed or wounded in attacks or from land mines or other explosives in the past three years, and nearly 200 were victims of sexual violence.Unicef released the report as negotiators worked against a March 23 deadline to reach a final agreement to end a half-century of war in Colombia, regarded as the longest active conflict in modern history.More than 220,000 people have been killed in the war, which has pitted government forces against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. Nearly six million people have been displaced.The use of children in armed conflicts is a problem in many areas of the world, but has been especially so in Colombia, where the FARC has been accused of systematically recruiting and training children since its inception in the 1960s.Last month FARC negotiators promised to end the practice as part of a broader effort to reach a peace agreement.The United Nations and international rights groups regard a child as anyone younger than 18.No child in Colombia today knows what it is like to live in a country at peace, Roberto De Bernardi, Unicefs representative in Colombia, said in the report.Even if a peace agreement is reached, Mr. De Bernardi said, he feared that children would still face risks from all kinds of violations including recruitment, land mines and sexual exploitation."}

{"text": "OAKLAND, Calif.   In a dim corridor not far from the court at Oracle Arena, a small team of technicians crammed into a small, space-age trailer. Tom Adza took his usual seat behind a bank of monitors and put on a headset.This gets kind of metaphysical, but Im trying to sense the moment and the story, and I dont actually feel like Im removed from the game, Adza said as he leaned over to tap one of glowing monitors. I feel like Im inside that building. Im right there.The greatest show in sports spreads to the world through this tiny box, barely large enough to accommodate about a dozen people: producers and directors, graphics and audio coordinators. Nobody sees them or hears them. Yet they sacrifice comfort for the greater good, broadcasting Golden State Warriors games on CSN Bay Area, the regional cable network that  after bearing witness to so much futility throughout the years  is riding the crest of a historic stretch of basketball.They could be playing these games in a barn, and they would still have the same type of electricity, said Phil Pollicino, 46, a producer for the network.As he prepared to help broadcast a game against the Phoenix Suns on a recent weekend evening, Adza, 56, recalled some of the leaner years  all the dysfunction and lopsided losses. None of it made for good television. Ratings sagged like a gutter full of soggy leaves.But the past two seasons have been spectacles. About 15 minutes before the tipoff against the Suns, Adza instructed his camera crew to get warm-up shots of Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green for a short introductory segment that would air at the start of the broadcast.We need 10 to 15 seconds of footage for each of them, said Adza, who was more than eager to feed the masses.Consider that the six most-watched events in the 30-year history of the network, which has gone by various names since its inception as GiantsVision in 1986, are Warriors games from this season, said David Koppett, the networks senior executive producer for live events. Seven games from this month alone rank among the 10 most-viewed Warriors games ever aired by the network. And the overall household ratings are up 137 percent from last season, Koppett said.They were so bad for so long, said Adza, who has been directing broadcasts for 20 seasons. Now I just try to get out of the way and capture whats going on.Each broadcast requires 30 people. Against the Suns, six cameramen were out near the court, with two people who ran cables and two others who handled audio equipment.Inside the truck, Pollicino and Adza sat in the front row next to Dan Berger, the technical director, who operated an enormous board of multicolored buttons. It looked as if he were manning a space launch. It was his job to execute Adza and Pollicinos vision  everything from flashing graphics to swapping camera views.Behind them sat Jen Gonzalez, who was in charge of the small scoreboard that lives in perpetuity in a corner of the TV screen, and Mike Rosenthal, who, as associate director, counted the broadcast in and out of breaks and communicated via headset with master control in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.Adza, who shares his duties with Dan Becker, another longtime director for the network, mixed instructions to the crew with the running commentary of a fan. After Thompson opened the scoring with a jump shot: Nice! After Curry tossed an errant lob: Oh, too high!Neither Adza nor Pollicino has qualms about being biased. They want a good product  and to attract as many viewers as possible. The Warriors are coming through for them.Do we root for a blowout so all the players can rest in the fourth quarter? Pollicino asked no one in particular.The Warriors have emerged as a cultural phenomenon, especially in the Bay Area. Pollicino said that he had gotten tickets to that nights game for his mother  and she doesnt watch sports at all, he said. Yet she wanted to know when Curry would begin his hallmark warm-up routine.That blew me away, Pollicino said. My 68-year-old mother didnt want to miss Steph warming up. Are you kidding me?There are occasions when Pollicino and Adza are freed from the broadcast truck  whenever one of the leagues national broadcast partners has the game, for example  and they often take advantage of the opportunity to watch from the stands. It always helps, Adza said, to get a different perspective. Perhaps he will see something that he can include in a future broadcast.But far from feeling limited inside the truck, Adza sees himself and the rest of the crew as conduits. The game goes through them before it reaches the television-viewing public, albeit on a 13- to 14-second delay, once the signal is relayed from New Jersey back to California and beyond.The audience keeps growing, thanks in part to the teams habit of doing the unthinkable. One such moment played out last season, when Thompson set an N.B.A. record by scoring 37 points in the third quarter against the Sacramento Kings. From his perch in the truck, Pollicino could sense the buildup in the arena.It can be a normal ho-hum game in the middle of January, and theyll create a moment that youll remember for the rest of your life, Pollicino said. So we have to be able to react in a situation like that. One thing this team has taught me is that you have to expect the unexpected.The long schedule includes its share of more prosaic moments. The Warriors found themselves in a tussle against the Suns, and Pollicino did not seem surprised  rainy day, sleepy crowd, weak opponent. When a discussion between Bob Fitzgerald and Jim Barnett, the networks on-air broadcast team, turned to an injury involving an adductor muscle, Pollicino asked his colleagues in the truck for medical expertise.Its right here, near the groin, said Adza, who reached down to point out what he described as its general geography.Pollicino offered a blank stare.Thanks for the visual, he said.The Suns took an early lead before the Warriors began to find their footing, and Curry closed the first quarter with an acrobatic drive.Every night, Rosenthal, the associate director, said as the broadcast went to a commercial.Curry has changed the way the network approaches its broadcasts. Adza wants the cameras to linger longer on Curry, and if he had more resources at his disposal, Adza would keep one on Curry throughout the game. Curry is a magnetic force  engaging, expressive and capable at all times of the spectacular.If you dont stay on him, youre doing a disservice to the viewer and to the league, Adza said.Most broadcasters can start preparing for a commercial break with time winding down in a quarter. Not the people at CSN Bay Area. They must remain completely focused on Curry.Steph might make a 60-foot shot, Pollicino said, and its reached the point where if he doesnt make it, youre almost disappointed.In the fourth quarter, as the Warriors extended their lead, Pollicino ordered a slow-motion replay of Marreese Speights mouthing, Were not losing! And then another of Green making an emphatic hand gesture.Im not exactly sure what that means, Pollicino said.Rosenthal piped up from the second row.More money, he said.The evening ended, as most game nights do, with a victory. The truck emptied out, another broadcast gone to the television ether. There will be more."}
{"text": "This past week brought the announcement that the producer Ben Silverman, with partners, planned to create a television series based on Isnt That Rich, Richard Kirshenbaums column in The New York Observer examining the habits of the Upper East Side penthouse class. Writing from the perspective of someone living in a 5,000-square-foot duplex on Fifth Avenue, Mr. Kirshenbaum, an advertising executive, isnt agitating for upheaval. Voices quoted in his columns deliver lines like It isnt a Woody Allen movie anymore, its Moscow on the Hudson, referring to New York in the age of Bill de Blasio, but the voices belong to people Mr. Kirshenbaum is working out with, in private gyms, in even more fantastical apartments.His tone ranges from gentle mocking to shared lament. A column a few years ago recounted the psychological evisceration endured by multimillionaires in an age when they have been surpassed by those who are much wealthier. Just when you think youve made it with your mack-daddy $10 million apartment, your wife comes home and says, So and so just bought a $35 million apartment, and you feel like a loser, one man says in the piece, tempting the reader to send him a bouquet of mood-lifting purple balloons.When the luxury rail car tycoon George Pullman died in 1897, so fierce was the animosity directed at him from the underclasses, and toward the entire robber-baron population, that his family buried him in a grave lined with steel-reinforced concrete and covered with asphalt for fear that former workers would desecrate it. The reverence or at least quiet sympathy that popular culture extends to the very rich  factors without which the ascendancy of a gaudy billionaire in a presidential election would not be possible  may have been harder to make sense of then.Consider the example of the addictive Showtime series Billions, which made its debut earlier this year. The show (Andrew Ross Sorkin, an editor at The New York Times, is a co-creator) positions Bobby Axelrod, a wildly successful hedge fund manager with a $60 million house in the Hamptons, against Chuck Rhoades, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, the kind of singularly focused prosecutor who believes that there are no innocent men on Wall Street. Even given everything  the host of sins perpetuated by the financial industry, the absence of any real repercussions after the crash of 2008, the maddening tax loopholes afforded the hedge fund system  you still watch Billions with your liberal heart rooting for Bobby Axe over the law. In this case, the law is embodied by the dour and puffy killjoy persona affected by Paul Giamatti as Chuck Rhoades. The show doesnt merely invite you to do this, it lassos you in and locks you up in the bullpen of Axes charisma.Axe (played by Damian Lewis) grew up as a working-class kid and went to Hofstra. When he decides he wants his name on the front of a major Manhattan cultural institution, it is an act of vengeance as much as vanity. Paying off the downwardly mobile aristocrats whose family name is already there, ostensibly in perpetuity, Axe first promises them $25 million to revoke their naming privilege and then breaks the news, humiliatingly in front of the institutions director, that in fact he will pay only $9 million. He informs them that this is because hed caddied for their family patriarch as a teenager, and the patriarch had been a colossal jerk and hideous tipper. And there, efficiently, Billions has you high-fiving whoever is sitting next to you, cheering for the brash ways of new, and bigger, money over the quieter wastrel ways of old.You wouldnt even mind, and would actually be pleased, if Rhoadess wife, Wendy (who, improbably enough, is a major player at Axe Capital) tossed her husband for Axe, with whom she possesses a more palpable, if platonic, chemistry. Billions manages the feat of making you want the guy who has everything to have even more.People still root for billionaires because it reinforces the idea that they can do it too, Mr. Kirshenbaum said recently. People dont want to be in a place where theres not a lot of magic left in the equation. Political analysts have long given this explanation for why poor or working-class people vote against tax increases for the wealthy: They want to believe that some day they, too, will have assets to guard. The fantasy of getting those assets by reeling in a billionaire thrives in a subgenre of fiction known as billionaire romance.Like the TV series, the film The Big Short puts you in the position of wanting the investors  or at least the investors depicted on the screen  to win. The movie channels your anger at the banks that came up with the perilous financial instruments that devastated the economy, but it leaves you no room to despise the charmingly eccentric rogue geniuses who made hundreds of millions of dollars shorting the housing market. All that hard work, the culling of documents and the fact-gathering trips to endangered Sun Belt real estate markets  it would be so wrong if they didnt triumph in the end. Institutions are greedy; people are merely obsessed."}
{"text": "TEHRAN   The pastry shop, tucked away in an affluent west Tehran neighborhood and selling Disney-themed cakes and party hats, is not particularly notable except for one thing: It is owned and operated by Irans powerful Ministry of Petroleum.The shop  along with luxury cars, an airline and dozens of other pricey assets  was seized by the government from Babak Zanjani, a 43-year-old billionaire businessman who for over a decade was a major figure in Irans sanctions-busting network and this month  received a death sentence for his dealings.Mr. Zanjanis arrest in 2013, after President Hassan Rouhani came to power, was portrayed as a symbolic break with the high levels of corruption that defined the years under the presidency of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, from 2005 to 2013. His conviction, by a lower court, was an attempt to show the Iranian public that, with the lifting of sanctions in January, the days of the sanctions-skirting middlemen are over.Reconnecting Iran to the world economy is a top priority for President Rouhani. But to fully reconnect, Iran needs to dismantle the network of thousands of intermediaries that was devised to get around the sanctions. The problem, economists and insiders say, is that enough sanctions remain in place that the Iranian economy still cannot function without the network.The government has taken some steps. The Ministry of Petroleum is working on a new, more competitive model for its oil contracts, and the Parliament signed a bill to fight money laundering, an important step toward more financial transparency.But there is only so much it can do. Regular financial transactions continue to be nearly impossible because the United States has designated the Islamic Republic a state sponsor of terrorism, stemming from its support for the Lebanese Hezbollah movement. International banks doing business with Iran can face up to a billion dollars in penalties if they violate regulations.The financial hegemony of the United States is so influential that European banks are scared to work with us, said Saeed Laylaz, an economist close to the Rouhani government. We also dont have enough dollars in foreign bank accounts, no international credit, so obviously some former sanction breakers continue to have an intermediary role.Iran has another reason to not dismantle the network too hastily. The middlemen it funneled money to for purchases around the world are sitting on billions of unspent dollars. Getting that money back is proving to be extremely difficult, experts say, and will only get harder if the network is dismantled. One financial consultant who requested anonymity because of his dealings with Iranian banks said the problem was exacerbated by a lack of record keeping.Mr. Laylaz estimates that between 5,000 and 10,000 people worked in the network, handling deals worth between $300 billion and $400 billion over the past decade.At least 10 percent was taken for commissions, he said, adding that that number did not include the money still controlled by those in the network, given to them by banks and even government institutions to do business.The chances that the government will ever see that money again are slim, Mr. Laylaz said. There are no traces of this money, the people involved have disappeared, heads of institutions have changed, he said.Nevertheless, the government holds out hope of reclaiming the funds. So for now, analysts say, Iran will limp along, half in the old sanctions-busting world and half out. This will be damaging, Mr. Laylaz said, because transparency continues to be a major obstacle for international companies to do business with Iran.Some businesses have managed to conduct open operations, selling some oil in euros, for example. But that business is limited by traders fears about running afoul of the United States Treasury, which enforces the sanctions.Other oil trading houses, such as Vitol and Glencore, have fallen back on bartering Iranian oil in exchange for other fuels. The financial consultant said that many people had become accustomed to the system and that, for the moment, they had no other options because bank transfers are highly complicated.But that simply invites more corruption, analysts say, a problem that reached epic proportions during Mr. Ahmadinejads presidency and has still not disappeared. Foreign business delegations visiting Iran and expecting to conduct business in an open and transparent fashion are often taken aback by suggestions that they send money in suitcases or pay into third-party accounts. One European businessman recalled an Iranian counterparts suggesting that he hand over cash.With a state-run economy and billions of dollars in oil money in the hands of the government, corruption has always been a problem in Iran, said Mousa Ghaninejad, an economics professor of economy at Shahid Beheshti University in Tehran. But nearly a decade of sanctions has intensified the potential of corruption.Quasi-state companies were given the task of evading the sanctions, and with the assistance of people like Mr. Zanjani made sure the country would keep running.As sanctions slowly started to bite in 2006, Mr. Zanjani set up a worldwide web of dozens of front companies, operating out of Istanbul, Bangkok and Tashkent, Uzbekistan. Iranian state and private businesses would order goods from Mr. Zanjani in Iran, and he would have his foreign companies purchase virtually anything: concrete, food staples, airplanes. The merchandise would be funneled back to Iran, and he took commissions on the sales.When Europe stopped buying Iranian oil in 2012 and the United States started to pressure top Asian buyers, Mr. Zanjani and numerous others found ways to sell Iranian crude on the black market. He would send tankers to deserted bays along the coast of Indonesia, for instance, where they would transfer the oil to other ships to hide its origins.A lot of money changed hands, and a lot of that money is wasted and gone forever, Mr. Ghaninejad concluded. But some might still be recoverable.That is where Mr. Zanjani comes in, his grim fate supposedly a warning to others in the network to return unspent funds to the government. But the picture is not as clear as officials might like to think, and their ability to intimidate Mr. Zanjani  and, by extension, others in the network  is clearly limited.As his case was heard in November, Mr. Zanjani, wearing striped prison pajamas, threatened to release information on corruption by government officials, said the $2 billion the courts say he owes the Ministry of Petroleum was chump change for him and added that he would have any sentence overturned on appeal. On that last point legal analysts agree, saying his death sentence is likely to be commuted after he repays the $2 billion.A spokesman for Irans judiciary, Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei, virtually confirmed as much after the death sentence was handed down. Mr. Zanjani had missed many deadlines for repaying the funds, he said, but clearly, if he does return the money this will have influence on his sentence."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  MOST people would be upset to be at the center of an agitated national debate about whether they were more like Hitler, Mussolini, Idi Amin, George Wallace or a Marvel villain.Not Donald Trump.He doesnt like invidious comparisons but hes cool with being called an authoritarian.We need strength in this country, he told me Friday morning, speaking from his Fifth Avenue office. We have weak leadership. Hillary is pathetically weak.She got us into Libya and she got us into Benghazi and shes probably got 40 eggheads sitting around a table telling her what to do, and then she was sleeping when the phone call came in from the ambassador begging for help. You know, the 3 a.m. phone call?I asked the brand baron if hes concerned that his brand has gone from fun to scary, from glittery New York celebrity to S.N.L. skits about him featuring allusions to the K.K.K. and Hitler. He blamed a disgustingly dishonest press.I wondered about ex-wife Ivana telling her lawyer, according to Vanity Fair, that Trump kept a book of Hitlers speeches by his bed. Or the talk in New York that in the 90s he was reading Mein Kampf. Nein, he said. I never had the book, he said. I never read the book. I dont care about the book.All over town, even in the building where Im writing this column, freaked-out Republicans are plotting how to rip the nomination from Trumps hot little hands.How does it feel to be labeled a menace, misogynist, bigot and xenophobe by your own party? Honestly, he replied, Im with the people. The people like Trump.Since he prefers to rely on himself for policy advice, is he seeking out expert help on the abstruse delegate rules? Yeah, he said, I have people, very good people, the best people. No details, as usual.Wont a contested convention require more of a campaign than aprs moi, le dluge? I have an organization but its largely myself, he said.More heavyweights are jumping in to stomp Trump, including Elizabeth Warren. Asked about her jabs, he pounced: I think its wonderful because the Indians can now partake in the future of the country. Shes got about as much Indian blood as I have. Her whole life was based on a fraud. She got into Harvard and all that because she said she was a minority.Told that President Obama was mocking his wine as $5 wine marked up to $50, Trump shot back, My wine has gone through the roof.What about Mitt Romney, whos pushing for an open convention? Hes a jealous fool and not a bright person, Trump said. Hes good looking. Other than that, hes got nothing.Paul Ryan, who will be leading the G.O.P. convention in Cleveland, says there could be a floor fight. But he protested that he would, no, no, never take it himself, just as he once said about the speakership.Ryan snickered at the idea that Mexico would pay for the wall and chided Trump for warning that there would be riots at the convention if the Gasping Old Party tried to snatch the nomination. Was the speaker interested in seizing the crown himself?I dont think so, Trump said, noting that he liked Ryan and that theyd talked. All that matters is the votes. I see people making statements about me that are harsh and yet they are calling me on the other line saying, Hey, when can we get together?Mitch McConnell also urged Trump to ratchet down the ferocity. Trump insisted that the violence is not caused by me. Its caused by agitators. He added that Hillary is the one disrupting my rallies. Its more Hillary than Sanders, I found out. The Clinton campaign called this patently false.But shouldnt parents be able to bring children to rallies without worrying about obscenities, sucker punches, brawls and bullying? The rallies are the safest places a child could be, Trump replied primly.Didnt the man rushing the stage give him pause? I got credit for that because it looked like I was moving toward him, he said.Trump said that when the agitators scream and the crowd screams back, Frankly, it adds a little excitement. But there must be a safer, saner way to get some oomph.I wondered if he realized that, in riling up angry whites, he has pulled the scab off racism. Obama, who is African-American, has done nothing for African Americans, he replied.He said he would soon unleash the moniker that he thought would diminish Hillary, the way Little Marco and Lyin Ted torched his Republican rivals; I want to get rid of the leftovers first.When he mocks Hillary, as he does in a new ad that shows her barking, it may backfire. Due to his inability to let go of his chew toy Megyn Kelly, Trump drew a remarkable rebuke Friday night from Fox News after he called for a boycott of her show and tweeted that she was crazy and sick. Fox painted Trump as a stalker, saying he had an extreme, sick obsession with the anchor. Unable to resist, even though he knows I respect Kelly, he also described her to me as a total whack job with no talent.He has a history of crude remarks about women from his visits to Howard Sterns show that could be used in Hillary ads. A conservative anti-Trump super PAC is running an ad with women repeating his coarse remarks.All of these politicians have said far worse than that, Trump said, drunk, standing in a corner.Joe Scarborough said that just as F.D.R. was the master of radio and J.F.K. of television, D.J.T. is the titan of Twitter. The titan agreed, gloating about how his tweets to his seven million followers, sometimes penned in his jammies, become cable news bulletins. Yeah, he said, Ill do them sometimes lying in bed.Not exactly a fireside chat. But it sure started a fire."}
{"text": "As the mother of four boys, then ages 3 to 17, Malini Wang was ready for a little serenity in her life when she and her husband, John, were house-hunting on Long Islands North Shore in 2013.She found it in the village of Roslyn, where the Wangs bought a hillside home.I do believe in karma, said Mrs. Wang, who discovered the house online. Since it was near her youngest sons nursery school, I decided to look at it right away after dropping him off, she said.The view from the half-acre property to the village below just took my breath away, Mrs. Wang, 48, recalled.The Wangs, who had been living in Mineola, N.Y., bought the 2,200-square-foot 1976 colonial, with its three bedrooms and three fireplaces, for $930,000.Life since then has been exactly as I imagined, Mrs. Wang said. Her husband, a surgical oncologist at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, has a convenient commute to work. And she loves the walk to quaint-looking village shops and restaurants. Its so picturesque, she said.The word picturesque crops up often in descriptions of this incorporated village of about 0.6 square mile, with two historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places, along with numerous structures. Both the villages Historic District Board and the Roslyn Landmark Society, an organization dedicated to education, restoration and preservation, oversee the integrity of the historic buildings.This is a nationally known entity, Craig Westergard, the president of the landmark society, said of Roslyn. Historic homes typically range from the mid-19th to the early-20th centuries, he said.Older yet is the Robeson-Williams Grist Mill, from the 1700s. The mill, which had fallen into disrepair, is scheduled for a $1.8 million restoration, according to Mr. Westergard, with allocated state, county and foundation funds, as well as money raised through local fund-raisers.Over all, its a charming village, said Joyce Styne, an associate broker with Laffey Fine Homes in Greenvale.The charm factor figured into Perrie and Matt Halperns purchase of a 1929 four-bedroom colonial on a wooded hillside for $920,000 in 2006. But for the Halperns, who had lived in a smaller house outside the village but within the Roslyn school district, the primary concern was keeping their twin daughters in Roslyn schools.They were impressed by the districts remarkable rate of student acceptance by great colleges, said Ms. Halpern, 55, an accountant and web site owner.Traffic can be busy in the village, and Ms. Halpern said some residents were initially concerned about increased congestion from a new 78-unit development of townhouses, condominiums and detached homes, Roslyn Landing. There were many community meetings to discuss those concerns, she said.Rob Antonucci, a managing member of the Ranches, Roslyn Landings developer, said that its ordinary to have meetings before construction. We worked with the village closely over the past couple of years, he said.Ms. Halpern said residents concerns had been addressed. She now sees the upscale development, soon to break ground, making the community more desirable.Were not far from Manhattan, she said, but where I am it feels like we could be in Vermont.What Youll FindWith about 2,800 residents, the village of Roslyn lies within what is sometimes called greater Roslyn: To the west is Roslyn Estates; to the north are the villages of Flower Hill and Roslyn Harbor, as well as Hempstead Harbor; to the east is East Hills; to the south is Roslyn Heights.The scenic Gerry Pond Park, operated by the Town of North Hempstead, has a duck pond and runs through Roslyns downtown. With a movie theater, the Bryant Library and restaurants, downtown Roslyn has a niceold-fashioned town feeling, said Rene Hughes, an agent at Daniel Gale Sothebys International Realty in Roslyn.Roslyns most recognizable landmark, an 1895 clock tower of around 44 feet, stands on a grassy triangle at Old Northern Boulevard and Main Street.Along Main Street, East Broadway and Old Northern Boulevard near Gerry Pond Park are more than 100 structures of historic architectural significance, said Anne B. Tinder, the executive director of the landmark society.In other areas  including Marchant Park and Roslyn Pines to the west and Mackay Way and Davis Lane to the east  contemporary homes mix with colonials and ranches.Its a very varied community, said Mayor John Durkin. There are co-ops, there are individual homes, there are rentals. Rentals include the Horizon at Roslyn and Atria on Roslyn Harbor, both for older adults;the Chalet, a five-story building; and the much smaller Flower Gardens. Under construction on Lumber Road is a mixed-use project with residential and retail space.The main commercial district, along Old Northern Boulevard, is lined with boutiques, a liquor store, a bank, a deli, restaurants and other businesses.What Youll PayBecause of a lack of inventory, homes that are appropriately priced will sell quickly, said Susan Cherney, an associate broker with Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Roslyn.But village prices are not homogeneous, said Ms. Styne of Laffey Fine Homes. There could be a house asking $1.6 million, and next door they could be asking $699,000, she said.Janet Berookhim, an associate broker at a different Laffey branch in Greenvale, called the market stable.For the 12-month period ending March 3, the median sales price for a single-family house was $810,000, compared with $809,425 for the same period a year earlier, Ms. Berookhim said, using Multiple Listing Service of Long Island data. The median co-op price for the 12 months through March 3 was $175,000, she said, compared with $169,480 for the previous 12-month period.On March 3, there were 21 properties on the market, ranging from a one-bedroom co-op in a 1955 building for $175,000, to a six-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath colonial house built in 1988 for nearly $2.1 million, Ms. Berookhim said.What to DoGerry Pond Park has walking paths, a playground and a gazebo.Roslyn is rich in restaurants and cafes, including Trattoria Diane and Dianes Bakery Cafe on Bryant Avenue(owned by Mayor Durkin and his wife, Diane Margaritis) and Hendricks Tavern on Old Northern Boulevard.Thyme Restaurant, on Tower Place, has acoustic guitar music with vocals on Friday and Saturday nights.For history buffs, the circa-1680 Van Nostrand-Starkins House, the villages oldest structure, is open seasonally by appointment. The Landmark Society hosts an annual tour of historic homes.The SchoolsRoslyn Public Schools serve all or part of seven communities, including all of Roslyn village. The district hasabout 3,100 students, said Barry Edelson, a schools spokesman.There are three elementary schools. Prekindergarten, kindergarten and some first-grade pupils attend Heights School; other first graders go to Harbor Hill School. Grades 2 to 5 go to Harbor Hill or East Hills School. Grades 6 to 8 attend Roslyn Middle School, moving to Roslyn High School at Grade 9.Average SAT scores for Roslyn High School in 2015 were 590 in critical reading, 624 in math and 606 in writing, compared with 489, 502 and 478 statewide.The CommuteThe 7:42 a.m. Long Island Rail Road train from Roslyn station, with a transfer at Jamaica, is scheduled to arrive at Pennsylvania Station at 8:32. The peak-hour fare is $13 one way. A monthly ticket costs $287. The drive of about 22 miles to Midtown takes around 40 minutes or more, depending on traffic.The HistoryEuropeans first came to the area from Connecticut around 1643. In 1844 the name was changed from Hempstead Harbor to Roslyn to avoid confusion with other town names using the word Hempstead. The name Roslyn is said to have come from the village of Roslin in Scotland."}
{"text": "Even before Valentines Day, our local grocery installed an imposing wall of Easter candies: foil-wrapped Cadbury Creme eggs; Peeps in impossible shades of yellow, pink and blue; speckled malted milk balls made to mimic robins eggs  all the makings of an industrial sugar swoon.For Eastertide treats with a more personal touch, I visited two spots: Boiano Bakery in Mamaroneck, a traditional Italian confectionary shop brimming with Neapolitan specialties, and the all-organic Red Barn Bakery, in Irvington, where the lofty hot cross buns and darling bunny-rabbit cookies (with pink-lined ears and fluffy frosting tails) had me vowing to give the Peeps a rest.Boiano Bakery,  258 Mamaroneck Avenue, Mamaroneck, 914-381- 4402, boianobakeryanddeli.com. Open Sundays to Wednesdays, 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., Thursdays to Saturdays, 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Wheelchair accessible.On a recent March morning that held suggestions of spring, Pasquale Colalillo presided over his bakery. Foot traffic was heavy, and everyone who came and went seemed to be on a first-name basis with the affable Mr. Colalillo, who goes by the name Pat (in a sort of perfect symbiosis, he also owns Cosmo & Alex Pisano Brothers, the Italian delicatessen next door).Born in Boiano, a small town in the mountains north of Naples, Mr. Colalillo came to New York when he was 8. When asked what he remembered about Easter in Italy, he waved a hand at the balmy weather outside and said, Days like this.And waiting to eat all of this he added, waving at a table laden with braided yeast breads, wheat pies and honey balls. It was the end of Lent, when we couldnt eat sweets. The chocolate eggs came with little surprises, little toys, and we wouldnt wait to open them. Back then, we didnt have these things all year.Easter Sunday, wed wake up early, go to church. We would have a frittata, an Easter omelet, with fresh mint. I can still smell it, he said.Mr. Colalillos heavily-stocked bakery  there are 15 varieties of biscotti alone  seems barely able to contain its contents.For Easter, there are pani di pasqua, plaited honey-glazed loaves embedded with bright-hued hard-cooked eggs and decorated with rainbow sprinkles; pastiere, traditional latticed pies filled with sweetened ricotta and soft wheat berries; struffoli, deep-fried marbles of dough, sticky with honey, mounded on a plate and dotted with red and green glac cherries; and pizze rustica, rich savory pies stuffed with provolone, salami, prosciutto and ham.Mr. Colalillos niece, Anna Scasso, decorates flower baskets and bunny cakes with special aplomb. She also has a gift for molding and coloring marzipan; in a charming display, almond-paste lambs lying in a pasture of cellophane grass were surrounded by figs and apricots that looked for all the world like real figs and apricots.The bakery also sells chocolate eggs imported from Italy with exuberant foil wrappings and colorful ribbons  similar to the ones of Mr. Colalillos youth  some of them big enough to share with a large extended family.Mr. Colalillo spoke with real nostalgia about Pasquetta, or Little Easter, celebrated in Boiano on the Monday following Easter. Everyone packs up the leftovers and scatters into the mountains for a picnic, he said. Its a beautiful holiday.Red Barn Bakery, Irvington, 4 South Astor Street, Irvington 914-231-7779, redbarn-bakery.com. Hours: Tuesday to Sunday, 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m. Wheelchair accessible.When Randell Dodge started the Red Barn Bakery in 2008, hers was in fact a cottage industry: She assembled pies in a closet kitchen in a tiny rented cottage in Bedford, and sold her all-organic wares at local farmers markets. The business thrived, and five years ago she made the move to real brick and mortar, undertaking a stylish renovation of a red brick building that had been a mechanics garage, located just south of the Irvington train station.On a recent sunny day, in the bakerys pocket garden, forsythia buds were on the verge of bloom; inside, customers hovered before the dazzling array of baked goods in a state of sweet indecisiveness. (Red Barn baked goods are also sold at Mt. Kisco Seafood, in Mount Kisco; Sgaglios, in Katonah; and indoor farmers markets in Bedford Hills and Pleasantville.)From an early age, Ms. Dodge loved baking. I was my mothers second set of hands in the kitchen, she said. Ms. Dodge was raised in Queens and went on to major in painting and ceramics at Bennington College in Vermont (she minored in math, which she said comes in handy in both baking and business).At Easter, Ms. Dodge expands her all-organic repertoire to include pastiera, the traditional Italian wheat pie, from a recipe handed down to her from her maternal grandmother. Made with separated eggs to achieve lightness, her version is at once rustic and refined, fragrant with orange and lemon zests, vanilla and cinnamon, and lightly dusted with powdered sugar.Her beautifully tailored Neapolitan ricotta cheesecake  almond crust, organza-light filling, ruby-red raspberry glaze and buttercream ruff  looks like an edible Easter bonnet (and belies Ms Dodges background in designing fashion accessories). Oversize hot cross buns, studded with raisins and homemade candied orange peel, baked to a lustrous brown, can be bought singly or in a cluster of six; the generous crisscross of icing will make these irresistible to children."}
{"text": "Dada is political. Dada conquers. Art is dead! These are among the messages confronting visitors as they emerge from the elevator into Everything Is Dada, an exhibition at the Yale University Art Gallery. The words are splashed across the wall in oversize uppercase lettering  or are they? Closer observation reveals that the wall is actually a slightly distorted mirror, and the statements, attributed to Max Ernst, George Grosz and other Dada artists, are printed backwards adjacent to the elevator. It is only as reflections that their meanings become legible.The arrangement is an apt metaphor for Dada, a movement of artists whose work was often playful, sometimes irreverent, rarely straightforward and always conceptually layered. Everything Is Dada includes 116 paintings, drawings, sculptures, photographs, prints and assemblages that exemplify these traits and that together provide a survey of Dadas provocative ideologies and approaches.The exhibition was organized by Frauke V. Josenhans, the museums Horace W. Goldsmith assistant curator of modern and contemporary art, to commemorate the centennial of Dada. It began in 1916 at the Cabaret Voltaire, a nightclub in Zurich that became a gathering place for artists and writers, some who had fled from countries immersed in World War I. After the war, as the artists returned to their homelands, Dada spread.These were men and women from different artistic and social backgrounds, Ms. Josenhans said on a recent morning in the galleries, but they all shared an opposition to the war, to societal norms and to hierarchies in the fine arts.Everything Is Dada showcases works by many, including Jean Arp and his wife, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, active in Switzerland; Ernst, Grosz and Kurt Schwitters, from Germany; Francis Picabia, Marcel Duchamp and Suzanne Duchamp (Marcels sister), from France; and the Americans Man Ray and Beatrice Wood. The exhibition is organized into sections that examine the movements assorted characteristics, such as the integration of text and image; the incorporation of mass media and found objects; a fascination with the subconscious; the use of caricature, political satire and humor; and the tendency toward abstraction.The lure of abstraction stemmed from the desire of many Dadaists to develop a new visual language. The artists blamed nationalistic tendencies for the war in Europe, Ms. Josenhans said. Abstraction was a response, a way to invent a universal language that would be accessible to everyone.Man Rays Revolving Doors, on view in the section titled Sense and Nonsense, was originally a series of 10 abstract collages of brightly colored cut paper, first exhibited in 1919 attached to a rotating pole that audiences could spin. After the collages were destroyed, Man Ray reproduced them as screenprints, which now hang in the gallery next to a replica of the rotating device made with reproductions of the prints. He didnt give an explanation of how to read them, Ms. Josenhans said. He left it to the viewer to experience them.Curiosity about what a viewer might experience, and about the relationship between language and perception, motivated Arp to create 7 Arpaden Von Hans Arp (7 Arp-Things by Hans Arp). A portfolio of seven lithographs, the images are simple organic black forms whose meanings shift when their titles are read. A small circle centered on the page is Ein Nabel (A Navel); a whimsical figure with two holes that could be eyes turns out to be Schnurrhut (Mustache-Hat).Picabia investigated the interplay between language and perception by inserting words into his images. In the section Irreverence and Social Criticism, his lithograph La Sainte-Vierge is a splotch of black ink beneath the words La Sainte-Vierge.Once he added the words, it was no longer an abstract ink splatter, Ms. Josenhans said, noting that this work exemplified the nihilistic aspects of Dada. It was against tradition, against religion, she said. There was a willingness to destroy anything.In the same section, a different sort of irreverence defines four figurative works by Grosz. Completed in post-World War I Berlin, they are satirical critiques of the political corruption and social decadence of the Weimar Republic. In the painting Drinnen und Draussen (Inside and Outside), members of the elite celebrate on the right side of the composition, flush, fat and well stocked with Champagne and cigars, while on the left, a disheveled man with a crutch and a wooden leg begs from passers-by.With its commitment to experimentation and its insistent re-evaluation of what constitutes a work of art, Dada encouraged the use of unconventional materials and inventive techniques. The section titled Everything and Nothing Is Art presents some of the avenues the artists took.To make his Rayographs, Man Ray placed objects on photosensitized paper and exposed the arrangements to light. There are 16 Rayographs in the exhibition, some with recognizable items like matchsticks and a feather, others entirely abstract.A careful look at Picabias painting Midi (Promenade des Anglais) shows the tree-lined waterfront depicted not only with oils, but with feathers, leather and macaroni. Concurrently, Schwitters was producing abstract collages and assemblages using scraps of newspapers, cigarette packs, fabric and other found materials. In wall text in the gallery, Schwitters is quoted as saying, Everything had broken down  new things had to be made from fragments.Dadas subversive and eclectic principles made it a springboard for artistic movements including Surrealism, Pop Art and Conceptual Art. Dada itself resurfaced in works by post-World War II American artists often referred to as Neo-Dadaists for their innovations with mixed media and their revolt against Abstract Expressionism. One wall in Everything Is Dada displays Neo-Dada works by Jim Dine, Robert Rauschenberg and William T. Wiley. A new generation was discovering Dada, Ms. Josenhans said.In an attempt to bring Dada into the 21st century, the show features an installation created in collaboration with graphic design students at the Yale School of Art. It fills a corridor between two of the exhibition galleries with floor-to-ceiling, black-and-white projections, videos, neon signs and lots of textual wordplay. There is a banner of Duchamps infamous Fountain, a neon rendition of Arps woodcut Poisson and the word ART, each of its large letters rendered with small multiples of the word DEAD. Along one wall visitors can pick up facsimiles of old-fashioned telephones to listen to recordings of Dada sound poetry, nonsensical combinations of deconstructed words. A rousing recitation of one, Karawane, opens with the line jolifanto bambla o falli bambla.Everything is Dada incorporates elements that accentuate the Dada spirit. A red velvet curtain invites museumgoers into a screening room where seven short films by Dada artists are projected, and another protects a group of light-sensitive  and mildly erotic  works on paper by Ms. Wood.Traveling through the exhibition, a bold dashed line zigzags above and below the artwork. I wanted to reflect the ups and downs of Dada, Ms. Josenhans said. The movement officially died in the 1920s, but then it reappeared, especially after World War II. Even today, contemporary artists mention these Dada artists as sources of inspiration."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  A United States Marine was killed on Saturday after a base in northern Iraq came under attack from Islamic State fighters, a Pentagon official said. It was the second death of an American service member in combat since the United States first struck the militant group in 2014.The Marine, who was not immediately identified, died from rocket fire, according to a statement from Peter Cook, Pentagon press secretary. Several other Marines were also wounded in the attack by fighters of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.Saturdays attack occurred on a coalition base near Makhmur, where American trainers and advisers are assisting Iraqi Kurds as they prepare for a push to regain Mosul from the Islamic State. That effort  is expected to involve a long, difficult fight.Success against the Sunni militants in Mosul would be a major victory, potentially strengthening assertions in Washington that the Islamic State is on the run in Iraq. Yet the Marines death offered a reminder of the risks to American troops, even in their advisory role.The statement from Mr. Cook said the Marine died while providing force protection fire support, a military term that describes efforts to actively defend a base under attack.The death came two days after Secretary of State John Kerry declared that the Islamic State had committed genocide against Christians, Yazidis and Shiite Muslims in Syria and Iraq. While significant symbolically, Mr. Kerrys statement marked no change in policy, as the United States is already leading the coalition fighting the Islamic State and has been actively bombing its militants, operations and facilities."}
{"text": "SAN ANTONIO   The Golden State Warriors have been a history-making machine this season, overshadowing nearly every team that tries to impede their progress. The San Antonio Spurs, though, are assembling a magical season of their own, and they stifled the Warriors, 87-79, on Saturday night at AT&T Center to make a little history of their own.No teams with better combined records had ever faced each other this late in a regular season, and with their victory, the Spurs extended a remarkable streak, defeating the Warriors in 33 straight regular-season home games dating to 1997, when Tim Duncan was still in college.The Spurs (59-10) put the clamps on the Warriors (62-7), limited them to 37.8 percent shooting and swarmed Stephen Curry on the perimeter. Curry shot 4 of 18 from the field and finished with 14 points, one of his poorest outings of the season.LaMarcus Aldridge led the Spurs with a game-high 26 points and made a clutch jumper for a 5-point lead with less than two minutes to play.The Warriors were playing their second game in two nights after defeating the Dallas Mavericks on Friday. The scheduling doyens at N.B.A. headquarters were not doing the Warriors any favors, and Golden State was also short-handed as Andre Iguodala (left ankle), Festus Ezeli (left knee) and Andrew Bogut (left big toe) missed the game.In Boguts absence, Coach Steve Kerr had little choice but to shift Draymond Green to center from power forward, but the teams perimeter play was the more glaring issue  and it was evident early. After missing his first three 3-point attempts, Curry had his fourth blocked by the Spurs Danny Green.Paying special attention to Curry, the Spurs extended their defense beyond the 3-point line. The Warriors looked lost in the first half, and the game settled into the slow rhythm that favored the Spurs. Curry and Klay Thompson combined to shoot 5 of 19 from the field, yet the Spurs led by only 6 at halftime. Thompson finished with 15 points.Curry swapped his sneakers before the start of the third quarter and kept searching for a rhythm that never surfaced."}
{"text": "In simpler times, a great barman was associated with a place  sleek or divey, he was always there. But this is the age of the pop-up, and like many great chefs, Matthew Biancaniello takes his cocktail craft on the road. Since he left his post at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotels Library Bar over three years ago, the L.A.-based mixologist has been mostly consulting, traveling and writing  and making his farm-to-glass drinks on occasion, at special events.Biancaniello grows and forages many of the components that go into his creations, and sources the rest from Santa Monica Farmers Market  his bar area typically looks like a cross between a kitchen salad station and a science lab, and he specializes in custom concoctions based on his clients palates. I love knowing exactly what you want, he explains  though with ingredients like Santa Barbara uni, wild bay leaf-infused whiskey and fresh emu egg, hes often serving up exactly what you didnt know you wanted in a cocktail. My drink isnt just about the drink, he says, its about the whole experience.In his new (and first) book, Eat Your Drink: Culinary Cocktails (Dey Street Books, $23), Biancaniello reveals his methods  and, perhaps predictably, encourages experimentation. Below, he shares a recipe for the gin-based Roquette, which is loaded with, of all things, arugula.Yield: 1 cocktailThis is one of the first drinks I ever created, more than six years ago, and remains to this day my favorite of all of my drinks, says Biancaniello, referring to his tenure at the Library Bar. I was depressed because I hadnt created a new drink in two weeks, and I went down to the walk-in for inspiration and saw some micro-arugula. Every time I experiment with a new drink, I muddle a new ingredient on its own with lime juice, agave and gin to assess the purity of the flavor, and this one did not need to be messed with. It has an outstanding flavor that pairs well with food, especially meat. I came up with the name because in France they call arugula roquette.-ounce fresh lime juice, preferably from a Bearss lime (also called Persian or Tahitian lime)-ounce agave syrup *see recipe below1 cup wild arugula, preferable rustic (Sylvetta) arugula2 ounces gin, preferably CapRock Wild radish flowers or micro-arugula, for garnish1.

{"text": "A proposal by a British government agency to let the Internet suggest a name for a $287 million polar research ship probably seemed like a good idea at the time.Now, the agency is the latest group to see what happens when web users are asked to unleash their creative energy: R.R.S. Boaty McBoatface is a clear front-runner.People quickly disregarded the more dignified names suggested by the Natural Environment Research Council  Shackleton, Endeavour, Falcon. Instead the contest became the latest in the Internets long, storied history to end up with social media users gleefully offering ridiculous names to government-funded projects.The initiatives are often hilarious but dont often succeed. Remember when Slovak lawmakers overrode the publics vote in 2012 to rename a pedestrian bridge after the actor Chuck Norris? Or the debacle in Austin, Tex., a year earlier, when people unsuccessfully tried to name the citys waste management service after Limp Bizkits frontman, Fred Durst?Corporations have also tried the tactic, and the penalty for trying to play with the Internet tends to be meaner: Mountain Dew learned the hard way when 4 Chan took control of a vote to name a new flavor, and the joke was on Taylor Swift and VH1 when the Internet chose a school for the deaf as a concert location.We have James Hand, a public relations professional and former BBC employee, to thank (blame?) for this latest episode. Mr. Hand became a bit of an overnight sensation when he submitted the name Boaty McBoatface after seeing reports of the competition last week. Then he watched his creation spin completely out of control.The storm that has been created has got legs of its own, Mr. Hand told the BBC on Monday, and added that he had submitted Boaty McBoatface in another competition. (For what its worth, Mr. Hand voted for the name R.R.S. David Attenborough.)The research council would not comment on whether it would override the Internets suggestion, but Alison Robinson, a spokeswoman, said in an email that the group was delighted by the enthusiasm and creativity of people vying for names like Boaty McBoatface. The ship is scheduled to set sail in 2019.Weve had thousands of suggestions made on the website since we officially launched; many of them reflect the importance of the ships scientific role by celebrating great British explorers and scientists, Ms. Robinson said. We are pleased that people are embracing the idea in a spirit of fun.Sure they are.The poll closes April 16  that is, if the Natural Environment Research Council can ever get the crashed polling website back online again."}
{"text": "Is Kim Wexler breaking bad?It seems possible. Her lunchtime excursion to a bar initially looked like nothing more than an act of disobedience by a chagrined employee. But when she summons Jimmy McGill to partner up and swindle an amorous engineer, who ultimately invests in a nonexistent tech company  well, its starting to look as if Miss Goody Two Shoes wants a new pair of boots.In this, her second walk on the wild side, it was easier to believe Ms. Wexler as a small-time, albeit reluctant, hustler, mostly because she gets so little joy from her work as an associate at Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill. Her solo performance at that class-action hearing was impressive, but it did little to lift her spirits. And given that she now has an offer from a rival firm  conveyed with a generous dollop of flattery by the name partner Rick Schweikart  it appears that her doldrums are not just about her current circumstances. Maybe life as a member of the bar just isnt for her.Have you ever seen her happier than she was while fleecing that engineer?This episode asks what Jimmy and Kim need for contentment. For Jimmy, the answer is a bit more obvious. He cant sleep in his Pottery Barn-ed corporate housing, then quickly goes nighty-night after returning to the nail-salon closet that was formerly his home and office. Better Call Saul has made the point so often that its starting to grate: a conventional law firm, with all its luxury touches, is not for Jimmy.It may not be for Kim either. I could suddenly imagine this duo scamming an assortment of marks at midpriced bars across the country  the Bonnie and Clyde of Bennigans. Certainly, she needs to leave HH&M, because even if Howard Hamlin eventually forgives her entanglements with Jimmy, he will never regard her as the superstar that she seems to be in Schweikarts eyes.That afternoon of tag-team fraud came as a welcome and surprising relief. For a moment I was worried that the episode, written by Gennifer Hutchison, was returning again to last weeks theme: that life for an associate at a white-shoe firm is spirit-deadening. And frankly, too much of Mondays hour trod that familiar terrain. There is Kim, dealing with Howard Hamlins iciness as the two walk to meet the new Mesa Verde clients, and there is Jimmy, smothered yet again by his overeager young minder. And behold a new indignity: during a night of insomnia, Jimmy sees a duller, text-heavy version of the client solicitation ad that landed him in so much trouble.Without the detour into Flimflam Land, this episode would have said little that hadnt already been said about these characters.There is no finessing my segue to Mikes story because, as I said last time, it is increasingly unconnected to the Jimmy-Kim show. Jimmy does not even get to say a hello to Grandpa as he did last week, because the two never intersect. And the tenor of these two tales seems ever more divergent. When the sharkskin-suited Salamanca twins  familiar as ax-wielding hit men in Breaking Bad  show up on a roof to threaten Mike and his granddaughter, the tone of the show instantly transitioned to what Id call Scorsese Dark. These boys never say much, but that only adds to the terror they instill.(Fun fact: One of the actors in this fraternal duo has an obscene phrase tattooed on his eyelids, which the producers of Breaking Bad didnt notice until the day the pair showed up on set. A makeup artist was immediately beckoned.)I enjoyed watching Mike outwit the lesser of the cartels two hired guns, using just a weapon and a TV remote control. But as much as I liked the confrontation between Mike and Hector Salamanca, I thought it unlike him to walk into that meeting with no plan more detailed than Demand $50,000, and in case of emergency make a halfhearted move for your gun. Yes, it showed you-know-whats of granito, but Mike is usually more clever in a corner. Demanding more money and then sticking to that demand seemed mundane by the mans own standards.Just as disappointing: The crisis precipitated by Tucos assault seems to have passed. If the show cared more about repeat business  i.e., viewers eager for the next episode  Nacho would have visited Mike not with the $50,000 promised by Hector for taking that gun charge but with news of an unforeseen wrinkle. Of course, Mike may have created a wrinkle by handing Nacho half of the booty: What if someone in the cartel finds out? But if that or some other oh-no moment is on the horizon, I wish Ms. Hutchison had hinted at it.As it is, I find myself yet again unsure why I need to tune in next week. I will tune in next week, because Better Call Saul in idle is more interesting than just about any other show in fourth gear. Exhibit A: Jimmy serenading Kim with Bali Hai, the song from South Pacific, its worth noting, that gives this episode its title. Though largely inert, the scene is affecting because of some alchemy of camera angles, Rhea Seehorns restrained performance and the wistful tone of Jimmys amateur-hour singing. And think of how much is conveyed about the bond between these two when, right before that call begins, Kim checks her watch, clearly hoping that her phone will ring and that Jimmy will once again croon into her answering machine.Exhibit B: The ground-level shot of a silver-skulled boot, worn by a Salamanca brother.But you can believe the show is beautifully realized and still think it ought to have more momentum and intrigue than it currently has, one season and six episodes in. Of course, I know momentum and intrigue are coming. Jimmy seems closer than ever to leaving Davis & Main, Kim is considering a new career, and a whole lot of Salamancas currently reside in Albuquerque. Im guessing those guys dont spend family nights playing charades."}
{"text": "Flicking through photographs on her smartphone, the jewelry designer Leslie Tcheyan lands on a nonpareil early 90s snapshot: Shes wearing a grayish, shoulder-padded blazer, with one arm around her 10-year-old daughter, Octavia Giovannini-Torelli (whos missing at least one of her front teeth). Both are dripping in diamonds. It was Take Your Daughter to Work Day and Mom arranged breakfast at Harry Winstons; I wore a turtleneck and Mom was devastated because I selected all of these huge necklaces, says Giovannini-Torelli, laughing. I remember, so vividly, her saying, I cant believe you wore that. Tcheyan, known to others as Che, is a jewelry-industry veteran: Over the last three decades, she worked at Fred Leighton and then began designing packaging and displays for the likes of Schlumberger, Verdura, Sothebys and numerous retail jewelers. This led to consulting for Verdura and other brands, all the while sourcing gems and antiques, and manufacturing contemporary pieces worldwide for private clients.Now, shes partnered with her daughter on a new line, Of Rare Origin, which officially launched in January. Dont take this the wrong way, but shes kind of the Jewelry Hustler, Giovannini-Torelli says of her mother. Nothing is ever a no, its an Ill figure out a way to do it. Giovannini-Torelli, now 30, has also had a past life: She worked at the firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects for seven years after she graduated from college (and continues to consult). I always imagined wanting to run my own business, and maybe its because I admired my mom, she says. I saw her lifestyle. It was creative and exciting, she got to travel and spoke languages,and with the manufacturing, the materiality, the problem-solving, theres a lot of that in architecture. She decided, at the end of last year, to convince her mother to launch a line with her  an act she chalks up to good timing, plus the amount of compliments shed received on her mothers creations. Octavia put together a sort of confidence package, saying, Mom, this is a special thing and we can do this, Tcheyan remembers. She was ready to be number one  or number one-half. Shes a uniquely capable individual. Giovannini-Torelli responded, without missing a beat: That translates to OCD.The Aviary Collection, Of Rare Origins first offering, is entirely bird-themed: Its filled with 18-karat yellow gold vermeil cages and perches and precious, hand-carved details, all made by Tcheyan and her team in Italy. The concept nods to another slice of family lore; they used to spend their summers in Montauk with Tcheyans late mother, Grandma, a European who lived through the war and who didnt want to ever waste food, so after breakfast, she took all of the crumbs and placed them outside, and the cardinals would come and eat them, Tcheyan says. She was a remarkable woman with a remarkable spirit, Giovannini-Torelli chimes in. She had a really thick French accent and would say, When I die and you see the birds, youll think of me. She really embraced it. The duo perfected the Aviary Classic style  a birdcage hanging from a single flower  and moved onto other earring iterations. Theres the modest Chicks, the South Asian-inspired Pagoda, the large but delicate Lovebirds, the floral-focused Nesters and the tasseled Swingers.Currently, Tcheyan (listed as boss on their shared business cards) handles much of the designing and Giovannini-Torelli (bossier) oversees the strategy; Tcheyans other daughter, Thea, dubbed the Ghost CEO, sometimes acts as a mediator. We still have to do everything together, and I think thats unusual for both of us, because Mom worked alone and I had a ton of autonomy at Tod and Billies, she says. As Im learning more about jewelry, Mom is learning more about what it means to be a brand name. The line, currently sold on their own site and on Moda Operandi, has grown to include rings and necklaces, which debut exclusively here  and will eventually move beyond the animal kingdom. To that end, Tcheyan pulls out a pair of hot-air balloon earrings featuring Baroque pearls. Nothings ever linear; theres no point A to point B, says Giovannini-Torelli. Its point A to Z, then Mars  then well get to B."}
{"text": "In recent months, there has been a sharp drop in Chinas foreign reserves, with lots of families and companies sending dollars overseas as the government cracks down on corruption and the economy weakens. Those fears have not let up, though this month the Chinese central bank did report an abrupt, puzzling slowdown in the outflows in February.What is known is that people seek a safe haven for their money in uncertain times, and that usually means the United States. This is especially true now that the United States has higher interest rates than other developed economies.As money rushes in, regulators should be thinking about the lessons of the 2008 financial crisis. In such times, lenders tend to lower their standards and make questionable loans. In 2015, loans held by American banks expanded at the fastest pace since 2007, driven mainly by commercial-property loans and also by car loans, credit cards and residential mortgages. The surge far outpaced growth in the overall economy last year, a sign that too much money may be chasing too few good opportunities and that lenders may be compromising standards.Another lesson was that banks, hedge funds and other financial firms are often linked through speculative bets they place on financial developments. Currently, some American hedge funds are making large bets on a devaluation of Chinas currency in the next 12 to 18 months. Regulators should be anticipating how this could reverberate through the financial system.Regulators do know more now about the vulnerabilities in the financial system, thanks in part to the increasing rigor of bank stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010. Even in areas where regulations under Dodd-Frank have been delayed and watered down, like rules to limit banks involvement with hedge funds, regulatory pressure and market forces have led banks to curtail some of the riskiest activities.But the system is still too opaque, and resistance to regulation remains fierce. Mutual funds, for instance, are opposing a rule that would require them to hold more reserves as a buffer against large and sudden redemptions.The lessons of the last financial crisis are clear. Less clear is whether regulators have the tools and the willingness to apply what they have learned to new circumstances and new threats."}
{"text": "ST. LOUIS   Few expected to see either team playing in the N.C.A.A. tournament on Sunday. Syracuse had needed the equivalent of a favorable roll in the mens basketball selection committee room one week earlier even to be in the bracket. And Middle Tennessee State had to accomplish probably the biggest upset of the tournament to advance to the round of 32.Both teams played with the extraordinary ferocity of competitors who do not want to lose with house money, with much shouting after makes and profanity after errors. But in the end, 10th-seeded Syracuse (22-13), the major-conference power playing its 100th N.C.A.A. tournament game, outlasted 15th-seeded Middle Tennessee (25-11), 75-50, pulling away in the second half.Syracuse, which imposed a postseason ban on itself last season in the course of an N.C.A.A. investigation that later found violations had been committed by mens basketball program, clinched a spot in the round of 16 for the first time since it made the Final Four in 2013. Syracuse plays 11th-seeded Gonzaga on Friday in Chicago.The Syracuse senior Michael Gbinije led all players with 23 points, including 9 on 3-pointers. Forward Tyler Roberson, a junior, contributed 12 points, 9 rebounds and 3 assists.The Blue Raiders had upset Michigan State on Friday, just the eighth time a No. 15 seed had eliminated a No. 2 seed since the tournament expanded in 1985, by jumping to an early lead on the strength of accurate shooting and then staying with the Spartans the rest of the way.But on Sunday, they started 1 for 6 from behind the 3-point arc, then 2 for 9, and finally 3 for 11 in the first half. Giddy Potts, a sophomore guard who entered the game as Division Is top 3-point shooter, was just 1 for 3. In the end, the senior forward Darnell Harris led his team with 11 points.It was not solely a matter of Middle Tennessee losing its touch. Syracuse is a nightmare matchup for many opponents. Few teams combine Syracuses commitment to an unorthodox defense  Coach Jim Boeheims 2-3 zone  with the athleticism and the size to execute it.Our zone is a little bit different, and people arent used to seeing our zone, Boeheim said after the game. Thats always a little bit of an advantage for us when theres just a one-day turnaround.From the beginning, the Orange disrupted the Blue Raiders passing lanes and made them slow to the rim, causing several shot-clock violations. Syracuse forces its opponents to take more time on their possessions than any other team, according to the analytics website KenPom.com.But Syracuses victory was not just one of scheme. Its dynamic players protecting the rim prevented Middle Tennessee from going inside effectively when it became clear that its outside shots were not falling.On one early possession, the Blue Raiders ran a gorgeous set to beat the zone, passing the ball down the perimeter, over to the left block. and then to a cutting Harris. But the Syracuse freshman Tyler Lydon was able to guard Harris closely enough to make him miss the layup.That instance was not even one of the six blocks by the 6-foot-8 Lydon, but it presaged the problems Middle Tennessee would have  even well-executed plays failed to reap rewards.Middle Tennessees own confusing, varied defensive schemes allowed it to stay close in the first half, which the Blue Raiders finished trailing by just 4 points. But in the second half, they were smothered by the Syracuse defense, at one point going 2 for 20 from the field as the Orange piled up points.Before the tournament bracket was announced, there was some controversy over how the selection committee should account for the nine games Boeheim, a Hall of Fame coach, missed as part of N.C.A.A. sanctions. The Orange went 4-5, and 0-3 in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Joe Castiglione, Oklahomas athletic director and the committee chairman, said the panel would not pretend hes not a difference-maker.In the end, that consideration was enough to get Syracuse, with its 20-13 rsum, into the tournament  it was one of the lowest-rated at-large teams  yet may have made it a higher seed than its talent justified. That, along with Middle Tennessees earlier upset, paved the Oranges way to the second weekend."}
{"text": "ATHENS   Greece and the European Union scrambled on Sunday to put in place the people and the facilities needed to carry out a new deal intended to address the migrant crisis that is roiling Europe, as hundreds of migrants in rubber dinghies continued to land on the Greek islands from Turkey.The accord, struck between the union and Turkey on Friday, set a 12:01 a.m. Sunday deadline for Turkey to stem the flow of people making clandestine journeys across the Aegean Sea to Greece in an attempt to enter Europe, and required Greece to begin sending back migrants who are not eligible for asylum.Yet processing centers on the Greek island of Lesbos and on several other Greek islands were not adequately staffed to comply immediately with the new measures, and officials said they were waiting for the European Union to follow through on a pledge to send at least 2,300 European police and asylum experts to help.By Sunday afternoon, around 875 migrants in rubber boats had reached the Greek islands since midnight, the government said, despite an  operation in Turkey that began Friday to detain migrants and the smugglers who make their journeys possible.Many migrants landing in Lesbos on Sunday appeared to be unaware of the new policies and were reeling from their harrowing journey. Greek television showed black and gray rafts arriving at the island laden with people, some sobbing with relief at having reached Europe, and others nearly unconscious. Two little girls were found drowned, and two Syrian refugees died in the crossings over the weekend.On Sunday, the Greek government began clearing out more than 6,000 migrants who had been waiting at processing centers and camps on several Greek islands, and transporting them on large ferries to Piraeus, the port of Athens, and to Kavala, a port in northern Greece. From there, they are to be sent to refugee camps recently set up around the country.Nearly 50,000 migrants are stuck on the Greek mainland at camps, in Piraeus and on Greeces northern border with Macedonia. More than 10,000 people have been living in miserable conditions in the Idomeni camp, on the Macedonian border, after west Balkan countries sealed their borders last month to cut the flow of migrants making their way to Germany and northern Europe.Once emptied of their previous occupants, the migrant centers on the Greek islands are to be used only to process those who make it across the Aegean Sea through a phalanx of patrols run by Frontex, Europes border agency, as well as NATO and the Greek and Turkish Coast Guards.The Greek authorities will register the migrants and process asylum applications. Migrants who do not apply for asylum or whose applications are rejected are to be returned to Turkey within two weeks. Under the accord, for every Syrian refugee returned to Turkey, the European Union will resettle one refugee directly from Turkey.For the tens of thousands of other migrants stuck in camps around Greece, the situation is less clear. Many of them are Syrian and Iraqi nationals who, for the most part, are considered eligible for political asylum and a program that would relocate them across Europe.Yet governments in several European countries recently began screening Syrians to determine whether the cities they came from were buffeted by conflict or considered safe, meaning that not all Syrians will be eligible for asylum.In addition, around one-third of migrants in Greece are from Afghanistan. After several European countries last month abruptly reclassified them as economic migrants, most were disqualified from political asylum, and will most likely be repatriated. That process could be lengthy, even after help from other European Union countries arrives in Greece.In the meantime, tensions have been flaring in some camps on the mainland as well as in Piraeus, where many migrants have been waiting, often for weeks, to find out if they will be able to cross the borders. On Friday, fights broke out between groups of Afghan and Syrian migrants in Piraeus, after a similar brawl the day before.At the Idomeni camp on Sunday, Doctors Without Borders said 33 migrants had been treated for injuries inflicted by the Macedonian police as they tried to cross the closed border with Greece."}
{"text": "At least 13 students died on Sunday when a bus crashed on a highway in eastern Spain while on its way back to Barcelona from a day of festivities in Valencia, Spanish officials said.The victims were all women, according to Spains interior minister. Most of them were believed to be foreigners studying at one of the main universities of Barcelona, as part of the European Unions Erasmus exchange program.The bus apparently hit a railing before swerving across the highway and ending up in the opposite lane, where it hit an oncoming car with two passengers, who both survived, according to the local authorities. Jordi Jan, a regional Catalan minister, told reporters that the initial investigation suggested that the bus crash was the result of human error.The students were traveling in a convoy of five buses that was returning early Sunday from Valencia, where they had attended the Saturday bonfire evening of the Fallas celebrations. The Fallas festival, held every March, is best known for its giant satirical puppets and firecrackers, and it is one of Spains biggest street parties.The accident occurred around 6 a.m. near the town of Freginals, about 90 miles south of Barcelona on the highway from Valencia, Spains third-largest city. The bus that crashed was the last in the convoy.The driver of the bus was being questioned by the police on Sunday afternoon after receiving psychological treatment. He tested negative for drugs and alcohol, according to the Catalan court that is leading the judicial investigation. He also has no record of any previous accidents in 17 years of bus driving.The interior minister, Jorge Fernndez Daz, who traveled to the crash site, told reporters on Sunday that the victims were women, without disclosing their identities or nationalities pending the result of a forensic investigation.The bus was carrying students from more than a dozen countries. After the crash, 43 passengers were initially reported as injured, but by midafternoon, 28 were still in a hospital, three of them in critical condition, according to the authorities.The crash was one of the worst road accidents in Spain in the past two decades. In 2014, in a bus crash in the region of Murcia, 14 people were killed while traveling to Madrid to attend a religious event.The highway was closed for most of Sunday as emergency teams worked to clear the crash site, using cranes to remove the bus, which ended up on its side, close to the edge of the road.The Catalan regional government announced two days of official mourning for the victims. The rector of the University of Barcelona, Ddac Ramrez, told reporters that the victims were most probably foreigners studying at his institution as part of the Erasmus program, although it was unclear which students ended up traveling on which bus in the convoy."}
{"text": "TERIBERKA, Russia   Tatyana Trubilina, the head of the local council in this desolate Russian outpost on the Barents Sea, wanted to make a few things absolutely clear: Not all 1,000 residents are alcoholics; not everyone is depressed; and nobody has committed suicide, at least not recently.Moreover, she said, her arctic domain is pure paradise if you like wild berries, fresh fish and, of course, vast quantities of snow.Such are the duties of being in charge of a place that, thanks to a critically acclaimed (at least in the West) and relentlessly bleak Russian movie, has an unwelcome reputation as possibly the most miserable place in Russia  a remote, frozen wasteland of drunks, brutish officials, crumbling buildings and unalloyed despair.Ms. Trubilina, an irrepressibly upbeat former teacher, campaigned loudly, albeit unsuccessfully, to ban the film, Leviathan, which was shot mostly in Teriberka and last year won a Golden Globe and received an Oscar nomination for best foreign film.The movies main character, a car mechanic called Kolya, has his life crushed by the mayor, a fictional and horrendously venal version of Ms. Trubilina. His wife, Lilya, kills herself. In between invariably hopeless clashes with officialdom and the Russian Orthodox Church, everyone swigs vodka and gets depressed.I cannot get my head around how anybody could make such a dishonest film, complained Ms. Trubilina, facing a portrait of President Vladimir V. Putin hanging on her office wall. It is an invented version of reality that does not exist. Like many of the films critics in Russia, she views the director, Andrey Zvyagintsev, as a traitor intent on smearing Russias gains under Mr. Putin.But Ms. Trubilinas defensive fury at what she sees as unfair distortion is far out of step with the way many other residents feel. Nobody likes his or her home being portrayed as a sinkhole of misery, but many take comfort in the view that Teriberka, whatever its problems, is no worse than countless other places in Russias glubinka, as Russians call their vast hinterland  or, for that matter, Americas. It is a territory scorned by urbanites but also often celebrated, by the same urbanites, as the locus of authentic national identity.Since Leviathan came out and began winning prizes abroad and fierce condemnation from Russian nationalists and even the countrys Culture Ministry, which helped pay for its production, Teriberka has attracted a steady stream of visitors. Some are film buffs, but most are outdoors enthusiasts drawn by the majestic natural beauty shown in the movie as a counterpoint to the remorselessly ugly actions of humans.Two hotels are under construction and will open soon, and a third, set up in a fish factory that has shut down most of its production, already offers scores of comfortable rooms.People want exotica, and we are at the end of the world here, said Olga Nikolayeva, the head of Teriberkas newly renovated House of Culture. In my view, all publicity is good publicity.Defying the council chiefs efforts to have Leviathan banned, Ms. Nikolayeva arranged to show it in her centers assembly hall. It had to be projected onto a wall because there was not enough money to buy a screen.It made us think about some of the serious problems we have here in Russia; I would like to watch it again, she said, adding that even local drunks enjoyed watching their onscreen counterparts. She said one of them had commented after the screening that it is good to look at yourself from the side occasionally.Some locals took the film too literally, she said, and should have realized that it was not just about Teriberka and places like it, but also about more universal themes evident in the title. The movies name is a reference to both the biblical monster in the Book of Job and the 17th-century English political tract by Thomas Hobbes about lifes being solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short without effective government.When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Teriberka had a population of more than 10,000, which was 10 times what it is now. Because of its proximity to sensitive military installations, it was closed to visitors from outside and could be reached only by boat. Since then, it has been connected by road to Murmansk, and K.G.B. checkpoints have vanished from the edge of town. But also gone are most of the subsidies and the state-owned fishing fleet that had kept Teriberka alive.This place wont even exist in 20 years, Ivan Koshpetruk, the fish factory manager, said.Those who have managed to stay on take great pride in having survived amid the ruins. Everything fell apart, but we are still standing, said Lyudmilla Bokotina, 69, a meteorologist who for 50 years has monitored Teriberkas fierce winds, snow and subzero temperatures from a wooden hut perched on an isolated hill. She treks there each day and, with help from a younger colleague, reports eight times every 24 hours to the state meteorological agency.She is a big supporter of President Putin, who she says raised salaries for state employees like herself by a third, but she is also an enthusiastic fan of Leviathan. It showed the truth, she said, hunched at a wooden desk cluttered with log books and meteorological instruments.She added: It showed how we live. There is no work, there is nothing for people to do, and functionaries only care about their own interests. It is all true, and we need to fight it.At first glance, much of Teriberka looks every bit as awful as it appears in the film  a jumble of abandoned wooden houses, crumbling concrete blocks and derelict wharves. The main road into town runs along a shoreline littered with the rotting hulls of fishing boats and other vessels, the last remnants of a once thriving but now moribund fishing and transport industry.Gazprom, Russias natural gas giant, had big plans a few years ago for Teriberka, promising to turn it into a logistics hub for the exploitation of the giant Shtokman gas field in the Barents Sea. But those plans fizzled, leaving the town with an abandoned Gazprom office and a half-built road to nowhere.Two general stores offer a wide selection of alcohol, frozen foods and candy, but not much else. A third shop set up to sell milk produced by 18 local cows that live in a heated shed offered only empty shelves and a kindly smile from the elderly shopkeeper on a recent morning.But the surrounding landscape is sublimely beautiful, with wide vistas of unspoiled tundra, the open sea and, at night, frequent displays of the Northern Lights, rippling curtains of illumination that fill the sky with a dazzling natural light show.Such spectacles have helped make Teriberka a popular destination for young Russians who come here to gaze at the sky in the evening and, during the day, attend classes in snowkiting, a winter sport in which participants use kite power to glide on and sail above snow and ice.Nikolai Rakhmatov, Russias former national kiting champion and the head of a Moscow company that organizes regular trips to Teriberka, delights in being out in the wild, far from the pressures, political and otherwise, of the Russian capital.Not everything depends on just the president, he said. He frequently shows Leviathan to his kiting students.Even the arrival of tourism rubles has left the council chief, Ms. Trubilina, cold. She complained that the visitors made too much noise and disturbed nature.We dont need wild tourism, she said, displaying the default position of Russian officialdom that rigid control is always preferable to potentially disorderly spontaneity.The only satisfaction tourists bring, Ms. Trubilina said, is their disappointment to find that life here is not so terrible and the hope that they might help counter Teriberkas and, by implication, Russias reputation for chronic despair."}
{"text": "For fans of the sort of jewelry thats best described as architectural, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has something better: It has commissioned four trained architects to translate the museums new building into wearable designs. In May, the museum opens a new expansion by the Norwegian architecture firm Snhetta. Who would match a Botta building with a Snhetta building? It really is a challenge. They are as crazy as me, laughs the Buenos Aires-based architect Diana Schimmel, of Mario Bottas original 1995 design for the museum. Schimmels pieces for the capsule collection similarly play on the merging of disparate elements; shes paired, in a mix of gold and silver, Bottas iconic round oculus and the striated lines of the new annex into a single entity.Available starting today in the museums online store (and in the gift shop once SFMOMA reopens in May), the pieces reflect a shift in scale from skyline to neckline, undertaken by women with these structural minds, converted to jewelry, which inherently has structural qualities, says SFMOMAs jewelry and accessories buyer Shane Salvata, who honed her eye at Saks Fifth Avenue and spearheaded the collaboration. Some of the 44 pieces of jewelry in the collection were inspired by the surrounding landscape of San Francisco and the museums living wall, the largest in the country; others, including from the architects-turned-jewelry designers Alice Roche, Marion Cage and Andrea Panico, by the new faade designed by Snhetta, which picks up the rippling effect of the waves in the Bay and shifts in appearance so beautifully with the changing light, says SFMOMA director Neal Benezra. Im still amazed how four people could interpret something so completely differently, and within the same medium, and yet each looks like the building, Salvata says.A professor once said that to design a hospital is the same as to design a spoon. I always saw him as a strange person until I began to design jewelry, says Schimmel, a longtime patron of museum gift shops. The user will understand, or not, the proportions, but they never mistake their feelings."}

Everton said goalkeeper Tim Howard would leave the club at the end of the season to join the Colorado Rapids of Major League Soccer. The move will end a 13-year stint in English soccer for Howard, 10 of them at Everton. Howard, 37, has agreed to a three-and-a-half-year deal with Colorado, starting when the Premier League ends.

{"text": "TEMPE, Ariz.  Everybody wears red around the Los Angeles Angels. It has been their primary color since 2002, when they won their only World Series. They often wear red jerseys with red numerals. Their executives wear red golf shirts. Their players wear red undershirts, sweatshirts and shorts. The 3-foot Darth Vader figurine in the middle of the locker room? He wears a red jersey, too.Albert Pujols is different. He wears a black undershirt around the clubhouse at Diablo Stadium. It distinguishes him from the crowd. One morning last week, while the Angels new general manager, Billy Eppler, spoke hopefully in a hallway about the teams young core, Pujols strode by, silent and stern and purposeful.That guys just going to keep sitting in the middle of the order and doing his thing, Eppler said. Hes a pretty special guy.For that fleeting moment, Eppler seemed to be back with the Yankees, where he apprenticed for 11 seasons and became the top assistant to General Manager Brian Cashman. Pujols, at this stage of his grand career, fits the profile of a modern Yankee: still productive, but long past his prime and signed forever. He hit 40 homers last season, but he batted .244. He turned 36 in January. The team owes him $165 million through 2021.No team  besides the Los Angeles Dodgers  spends like the Yankees, but their payroll obscures the smaller deals that have also helped them to 23 winning seasons in a row. Those transactions, the ones that blended scouting and analytics, were specialties of Epplers. Think of the trades for Nick Swisher and Brandon McCarthy, underperforming players who thrived with the Yankees and cost little in return.I think you demonstrate that to the people interviewing you, like, Theres other moves that the Yankees make, Eppler said. Its not just the $150 million guys and nothing else. There are other moves; they just dont grab the attention in New York.Eppler had interviewed with the San Diego Padres, the Seattle Mariners and once before with the Angels, who finally hired him in October. He is the full-time replacement for Jerry Dipoto, who resigned in July and had had an uneasy alliance with Mike Scioscia, the Angels manager since 2000.No other manager has been in his current job as long as Scioscia, and few, if any, wield as much power. Eppler, who saw Cashmans mostly smooth interactions with a similarly outsize dugout figure, Joe Torre, seems like a good fit.Hes going to relate with Mike Scioscia, because thats his personality, Cashman said. He wants everything that Mike has to give, just like hes going to want everything the analytics department or the player-development or the amateur side is going to provide. His job is then to make sure you bring all that together in some form thats cohesive, so they can execute consistent winning.Eppler has built a five-man analytics department with the Angels, led by Jonathan Luman, who was a propulsion engineer for Boeing and a systems engineer at the applied physics laboratory of Johns Hopkins University.Eppler, a former college pitcher, also added new scouts and brought two aides from New York: the assistant general manager Steve Martone, who had been the Yankees pro scouting manager, and a special assistant, Eric Chavez, the former infielder who had worked in the same role for the Yankees.In New York, Chavez bonded quickly with Eppler, partly over their San Diego roots but also over Epplers ability to articulate his ideas clearly. Chavez was a star of the Oakland Athletics Moneyball era but wishes the As executives had shared their values with the players.Theres always been a huge curtain between the old-school guys and the numbers people, and that curtain needs to come down, Chavez said. They both bring good stuff to the table, and youve got to bring it together.Chavez added that Eppler had the self-confidence to seek out and value others opinions. Players have told Chavez they appreciate Epplers outgoing nature and his interest in their lives.Hes a great guy, center fielder Mike Trout said. He comes around the clubhouse every day, talks to us. You can joke around with him and tell him anything. Thats how G.M.s should be: Interact with the players, come in and act like part of the team.Relating to Scioscia matters most. Since the 2002 championship, Scioscia has led the team to six American League West titles, most recently in 2014, when the Angels had the leagues best record but were swept by Kansas City in October. They finished third last season, at 85-77.Scioscia called Eppler a baseball rat with a diligent approach, like-minded goals and strong communication skills.You can talk about Billys vision and what he does, but hes a great listener, Scioscia said. He takes information, absorbs it, trusts what guys on the major and minor league staff can do and their input, and its going to help him in his decisions.Those decisions began, in November, with a trade for Atlanta shortstop Andrelton Simmons, perhaps the pre-eminent defensive player in the game. That deal cost the Angels Sean Newcombe, the best prospect of a farm system now ranked last in the majors by Baseball America, and it was the teams only major move.Scioscia said he was encouraged by the lesser-heralded new Angels, a group that includes catcher Geovany Soto, third baseman Yunel Escobar and left fielder Daniel Nava, who was 14 for 26 entering Sunday, with eight walks and one strikeout.Nava would seem to be an unlikely choice as a starter for a team with title hopes. He hit .303 for Bostons 2013 champions, but he tumbled to .152 last year for the Red Sox, who let him go on waivers. Because they resisted expensive free-agent outfielders like Yoenis Cespedes, Alex Gordon and Justin Upton, the Angels  who are still paying most of the contract of the departed Josh Hamilton  will not pay a competitive balance tax on their payroll.Making the most of Trouts prime, and winning while Pujols remains a force, might have called for more urgency. But Eppler likes his roster and said he was not given strict payroll parameters.I feel satisfied, he said. When I look back at the winter and how things went, we unfolded the big move first. Maybe from an order-of-operations standpoint, we had the main course first. But the C.B.T. and all those types of things were not mandates. They were considerations, just like anything else.Eppler signed a four-year contract, but the mandate, he said, is the same as it was in New York: to win now. He watched Cashman alleviate the pressure with humor, and plans to do the same in Anaheim.Im not quite the jokester than Cashman is, Eppler said, but I will try to evoke some laughter on a pretty regular basis, if I can.Joking comes easier on winning teams, of course. Eppler has experience with those, and now has the chance to build his own."}
{"text": "Roger Agnelli, a former banking executive who helped turn the Brazilian company Vale into a global mining giant, died on Saturday when his private plane crashed in So Paulo, Brazil. He was 56.Mr. Agnelli, his wife Andrea and their children, Ana Carolina and Joo, were en route to a wedding in Rio de Janeiro when the Comp Air 9 turboprop monoplane slammed into two homes just minutes after taking off, killing all seven people aboard, according to Reuters and a statement released by Vale.The others on the plane were the pilot and the spouses of the Agnellis children. The company statement did not indicate the cause of the crash.Mr. Agnelli took over as president and chief executive of Vale in 2001 after nearly 19 years at one of the countrys largest banks, Banco Bradesco, which is a major shareholder in Vale. The company was at the end of a process of privatization that had begun in 1997, though the government retained a stake in the company.Under Mr. Agnelli, Vale grew into one of Latin Americas biggest companies: the second-largest mining company in the world at the time, and the largest producer of iron ore.Known by some as the Iron Man, Mr. Agnelli was a tough negotiator and a bold executive who expanded the companys reach into markets in Asia, particularly China.In 2006, he presided over the companys $18 billion purchase of Inco, a Canadian nickel producer, the largest acquisition that had ever been made by a Latin American company, Vale said.Seven years into his tenure, the companys market value had increased from $8 billion to $150 billion, according to the book Global Latinas: Latin Americas Emerging Multinationals by Lourdes S. Casanova.In 2013, Mr. Agnelli was named to the No. 4 spot on Harvard Business Reviews list of the best performing chief executives in the world, behind Steve Jobs of Apple, Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Yun Jong-yong of Samsung.According to Ms. Casanova, Mr. Agnelli challenged the traditional notion that mines are best run in enclaves separate from the local community, citing the construction of a model mine in 2004 in the Brazilian state of Paran.We brought in water and sewage treatment, a school, a police station and technical training, Mr. Agnelli said in an interview quoted in the book. As modern miners we cant just be technicians. We need to listen to the community and be less arrogant.Mr. Agnelli was ousted in 2011 after friction with the Brazilian government, which pushed for the company to invest more in the countrys workers and industries.The company had seen its value double in the previous five years, but Mr. Agnelli angered government officials by laying off more than 1,000 workers and slashing investments in Brazil.Mr. Agnelli was born on May 3, 1959, in So Paulo.In recent years, he had worked on his own mining venture, AGN Participaes.Information on survivors was not immediately available."}
{"text": "(Want to get this briefing by email? Heres the sign-up.)Good evening. Heres the latest.1. President Obama and Cubas president, Ral Castro, shared a cordial handshake at a welcoming ceremony in Havana and opened talks on normalizing relations, despite the continuing trade embargo and deep differences on human rights. More than 50 years of Cold War hostility did not serve our interests or the interests of the Cuban people, Mr. Obama said. Watch their news conference, above._____2. Hillary Clinton resoundingly affirmed U.S. support for Israel, and jabbed at Donald Trumps promise of neutrality, in a speech to the nations most influential pro-Israel lobbying group. Watch a clip, above. The only Jew among the presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders, was also the only one to decline to appear at the American Israel Public Affairs Committees annual policy meeting._____3. Mr. Trump took full advantage of his visit to Washington for the Aipac meeting. Ahead of his speech, he tried to build bridges with the Republican establishment, meeting with members of Congress, lobbyists and power brokers. He also released his long-awaited list of advisers on foreign policy and held a news conference, above, at a hotel hes building. If people want to be smart, they should embrace this movement, he said._____4. Our latest political poll reveals paradoxes in both parties. Republican primary voters are depressed and discouraged by the divisions in their party, but appear to be coalescing around Mr. Trump. Democratic voters appear more satisfied by the tenor of their race, but Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders are virtually neck and neck.5. Apples product event, one of the shortest in memory, bucked its trend of bigger screens, introducing a smaller iPhone and iPad Pro. There was also a peek at the companys U.F.O.-like new campus. And the chief executive, Tim Cook, above, defended Apples battle with the government over our data and our privacy. But then the Justice Department moved to potentially sidestep that confrontation, saying it might no longer need Apples assistance to extract data from an iPhone._____6. The director of a prominent tennis tournament, above with Serena Williams, apologized after setting off outrage with his comment that female players ride on the coattails of players like Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal. Ms. Williams, who lost in the final at Indian Wells, Calif., said, If I could tell you every day how many people say they dont watch tennis unless theyre watching myself or my sister  I couldnt even bring up that number. And our columnist writes that his comments went way beyond awkward, well into misogynist._____7. Some U.S. universities have bolstered sagging bottom lines by attracting international students. Idaho State, where one in 10 students is from the Middle East, has seen layers of cultural clashes and problems play out, including episodes of stalking, drag racing and plagiarism. But now, with low oil prices cutting into Mideast budgets, the number of foreign students may drop sharply._____8. Demonstrations across the country pressed for Senate Republicans to hold hearings for President Obamas Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. Above, a protest in Louisville, Ky. Chief Justice John Roberts criticized the politicization of the confirmation process in a speech 10 days before Antonin Scalia died. We dont work as Democrats or Republicans, he said at a law school in Boston, but partisan fighting could give a very unfortunate impression otherwise._____9. The number of migrants landing on the Greek isles may have dropped to just a few hundred, two days after a deal made by the European Union mandated their return to Turkey. The numbers show a significant decrease, but its too early to draw clear conclusions, a Greek official said. The status of more than 50,000 migrants already in the country has not been addressed. Above, an encampment in Athens._____10. A shake-up in Big Pharma: The drug giant Valeant is replacing its chief executive, J. Michael Pearson. His once admired business model, focused on buying companies, slashing costs and raising prices on undervalued drugs, is now seen as an emblem of corporate greed. The companys stock rose 7 percent on the news.U.S. stocks edged higher. The Dow and the S.&P. 500 rose 0.1 percent, and the Nasdaq climbed 0.3 percent._____11. Lastly, researchers keep finding new surprises about parrots, which they say rival the great apes and dolphins for intelligence and resourcefulness. Some can count, some use tools and some even dance. And they are fierce foragers, disdaining fruit pulp in favor of the embryonic seed system. A parrot is a plant carnivore, one expert said. It destroys the seed. It goes right in through the fruit and eats the plant baby._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And dont miss Your Morning Briefing, posted weekdays at 6 a.m. Eastern, and Your Weekend Briefing, posted at 6 a.m. Sundays.Want to look back?

{"text": "DENVER  Mark Few stood outside the Gonzaga locker room Saturday after his Bulldogs had mopped the court with yet another opponent from a supposedly stronger conference.Fews 11th-seeded Bulldogs had routed Utah, a third seed out of the Pacific-12, by 82-59.On Thursday, Gonzaga, from the West Coast Conference, defeated the Big East champion, Seton Hall, by 68-52, a victory that in some ways was made more surprising because of what the Pirates represented.With a late-season run and a program dominated by New York City players, Seton Hall became a symbol of a reconfigured, resurgent Big East, where basketball is once again king.Few had monitored the rebuilding process after the Big Easts disastrous flirtation with football decimated what was perhaps the nations pre-eminent basketball conference. Like so many basketball purists who admired the Big East, Few was disappointed by the leagues football-related implosion.I was just taken aback and shocked about football and why it was driving the whole thing, Few said. I just didnt understand why teams with unbelievable brands and marketing, and a league with all that, would react to football.Many acknowledge that mistake now. The question is whether the Big East can ever become the dynamic force it was from the 1980s until only recently.Im confident that it can be done in the Big East, said Val Ackerman, the conference commissioner. We have too much going for us as a conference  our schools are so committed, we have great coaches, great players.The Big East was formed in 1979 by Dave Gavitt to be a great basketball conference made up of like-minded members  most of them private Roman Catholic universities  in major media markets in the Northeast. From 1984, when Georgetown became the first Big East team to reach the Final Four, until 2013, when Louisville, then with the Big East, won the national title, the Big East was to basketball what the Southeastern Conference has become to football.But the Big East was crippled by the departure of several universities that wanted to be affiliated with conferences that played big-time college football. The rebuilding and rebranding process has taken three years.The source of Ackermans optimism is the deep pool of talent that has been on display throughout the N.C.A.A. mens tournament. She believes that universities with a basketball-only philosophy will appeal to players who dont want to share a spotlight with football.These are basketball schools, Ackerman said. These players are going to be the big men on campus. The football shadows will not be cast on the basketball players at Big East schools.But Jay Wright, the coach at Villanova, doesnt believe that the conference will ever fully recapture a dominant profile.When the Big East had Syracuse and UConn, they were the glory years, and St. Johns, he said. I think college football has eliminated that.Wright, whose team is a second seed in this years tournament, said he thought his Wildcats did not do their part to carry the Big East flag a year ago, when they were eliminated in the round of 32. This season, they have advanced a round further by beating seventh-seeded Iowa, 87-68, on Sunday. Four of the five Big East teams to make the tournament have been eliminated. Xavier was the latest to go, losing at the buzzer Sunday to Wisconsin, 66-63.We definitely let down the Big East last year, Wright said. We were a good enough team to advance. We didnt do it. And we take responsibility for that.I agree with Ackerman that the Big East can come roaring back, but for that to happen, Gavitts vision of a nationally relevant conference driven by basketball needs to be geographically expanded.As I watched Gonzaga, from Spokane, Wash., dismantle Seton Hall in the round of 64, I thought that basketball-centric Gonzaga  and its conference rival St. Marys, from California  would be a perfect fit in an expanded Big East.Gonzagas Few never suggested that his university or St. Marys would join such a league, but he acknowledged that such a realignment made some sense.I actually think the Big East is positioned, if they want, to expand, he said. If they wanted to expand nationally, I think that would be really, really crafty, and they could be a national basketball-only conference.Obviously, there are a number of logistical tangles to be worked. The Big East faced many of these years ago when the conference abandoned geographic integrity by expanding to Miami, then Chicago (DePaul), Milwaukee (Marquette) and finally to Omaha (Creighton).Why not keep going and have, as Few suggested, a presence in every time zone?Out of necessity, a national Big East Conference would be divided into Western and Eastern divisions to cut down on travel and reduce time away from class. It would also create compelling new rivalries. So let the so-called Power 5 conferences carry  and risk sinking under  the enormous weight of football and its multimillion-dollar facilities and multimillion-dollar coaching salaries.A national Big East basketball conference would offset some of the deleterious effects of football and give fans across the country what the old Big East delivered so well.Ackerman said the conference was not ready to expand beyond 10 members. In any event, in her view, this season has been a success, regardless of what happens during the N.C.A.A. tournament.She pointed out that television ratings continued to be robust, that over the last three years roughly half of Big East teams had reached the N.C.A.A. tournament. Big East programs have been nationally ranked.These are what power conferences do, Ackerman said. They have all of these metrics to brag about, and so it was for the Big East this year.Earlier in the decade, the leadership of the once powerful Big East embraced football and learned its corrupting influences the hard way. The mistake now would be to stay put  in other words, to stay regional.The Big East needs to expand on the vision Gavitt provided 37 years ago when he formed a regionally dominant basketball-only conference. Its survival may depend on it."}
{"text": "A game between two of the worst teams in the N.B.A. unfolded appropriately enough on Sunday evening.There was sloppy passing, crooked shooting, ham-handed dribbling, questionable decision-making and, over all, a general air of indifference. The fans in the sellout crowd at Madison Square Garden responded, in turn, with two hours of sustained quietude that belied their presence at a professional sports event.In the end, the Knicks  playing without Carmelo Anthony, who sat out with a migraine headache  proved more inept than the Sacramento Kings, who slunk away from the Garden with an 88-80 victory, their 27th win. The Knicks fell to 28-43 and looked as if they could use a good nights sleep.The game was the Knicks first back at home after six straight on the road  a trip that took them through Denver, Phoenix, Los Angeles, Oakland and Washington. Kurt Rambis, the teams coach, noticed that his club, which had played on Saturday night, looked sluggish during the pregame walk-through on Sunday. He could tell that crisscrossing time zones had drained his players. That did not augur well for the game itself.Evidence of the Knicks somnolence abounded early on. In the first quarter, DaMarcus Cousins swiped an offensive rebound with surprising ease and notched a second-chance basket after a missed Kings free throw. In the second, Rudy Gay reverse-dunked over Robin Lopez from a virtual standstill.We had three quarters of guys scoring under 20 points, Rambis said afterward. To me, guys looked tired.The Knicks were losing, 28-12, after one period against a team ranked 23rd in the league in points allowed per 100 possessions (109.3) and 30th in points allowed per game (109.6).The Knicks clawed back from their abysmal start and kept things relatively close, mostly thanks to Lopez, who scored 23 points while shooting 9 for 20 from the field and grabbing 20 rebounds. But the Kings lead never quite felt threatened. Cousins grabbed 20 rebounds, too, and led all scorers with 24 points. The Knicks shot 35.2 percent from the field. The Kings shot 39.8 percent.It felt empty, Lopez said of his impressive statistical performance.The game, if only from an aesthetic standpoint, could have used a player like Anthony. According to the Knicks, he began feeling migraine headache symptoms during Saturdays game. On Sunday afternoon, Anthony went through the teams walk-through at the arena, but bright lights were aggravating the symptoms. He spent some time before the game in a dark room to calm the pain, to no avail.The Knicks have lost all eight games that Anthony has missed this season.The Knicks were also missing Kevin Seraphin (sore left foot) and Lance Thomas (sprained left medial collateral ligament). Before the game, Seraphin had an X-ray exam, which showed nothing serious.The absences compelled the Knicks to recall Cleanthony Early from their Development League affiliate. It was Earlys first time dressing for the Knicks since he was shot in the right leg in a robbery in Queens on Dec. 30.When you look back on it, the biggest part of it was just how fortunate he was that something more disastrous didnt happen, especially when you look at what could have happened with his knee, Rambis said of Early.Early had been scheduled to play four D-League games with the Westchester Knicks, but illness forced him to miss all but one of those contests. Early entered the game on Sunday just before halftime. He played 19.3 seconds and accrued no statistics.Nevertheless, Earlys mere presence was a bright spot for the Knicks on an otherwise forgettable night.Thats one of my close friends, Langston Galloway said of Early. The beginning was definitely hard for him, just knowing that, man, I could be gone right now. But secondly, it was, I really have a second chance. And he wants to show that he can come back from this.There are 11 games left on the Knicks schedule.REBOUNDSGiven the Knicks needs at the point guard position, RAJON RONDOs name has often come up in speculation about free agents the team might pursue this summer. Asked early last month about the Knicks, Rondo (2 points, 6 assists) said the teams triangle offense was not really a good look for me. DEREK FISHER, the Knicks coach at the time, responded shortly afterward, saying, You cant ask a guy that wasnt very successful playing against it whether or not he wants to come play in it. On Sunday, it was Rondos turn to respond. Reminded of Fishers comments on Sunday morning, Rondo said, He mightve blacked out a couple of times. Using some colorful language, he noted that he and the Boston Celtics had beaten Fisher and the Los Angeles Lakers, who ran the triangle offense, in 2008. He acknowledged that the Lakers had beaten the Celtics in the finals two years later. And Rondo was more diplomatic about the viability of the triangle: I think its great for team chemistry, he said."}
{"text": "On Tuesday afternoon, the Tampa Bay Rays will play an exhibition game against the Cuban national baseball team in Havana. The moment will surely stand out, but it will not be nearly as groundbreaking as the game the Baltimore Orioles played there 17 years ago.That game occurred on March 28, 1999, at a time when the United States embargo against Cuba made American business ventures in Cuba virtually impossible. Peter Angelos, the owner of the Orioles, was a strong critic of the economic blockade of the island nation, however, and sought to foster improved relations between the countries through baseball.He had previously been denied requests to take his team to Cuba, but when President Bill Clinton announced an easing of travel restrictions, Angelos, a Clinton donor, appealed again and was granted permission to pursue his idea.Bud Selig, then the baseball commissioner, appointed Sandy Alderson, now the Mets general manager but then one of his key deputies, as his point man. Alderson, Angelos and a small contingent of other baseball officials went to Cuba in early March to lay the groundwork for the trip. Weeks later, the Orioles played the Cuban national team, the first time a major league club had been in Cuba in 40 years. Five weeks later, there was a rematch in Baltimore.In recent interviews, participants in those games looked back, often with a little bit of wonderment at what occurred.The GenesisPETER ANGELOS, the Orioles owner: I always felt the embargo was a mistake and it did not work. In my mind, it was unfortunate and never should have happened. So I felt we had to put all that aside and re-establish the dialogue. I felt the two countries could get together and put behind their differences, and what better way to start than through baseball, the national sport of both countries?SANDY ALDERSON, baseballs point man in the talks with Cuba: I dont think M.L.B. would have done it without Peter really pushing it. It ended up costing him a lot of money because he had to cover all the losses.BRADY ANDERSON, one of the Orioles top players at the time: I was for it. I wanted to go play the Cuban team. I had always dreamed of playing internationally, but I never had the chance to play in the Olympics. I knew it was going to be historic, interesting and unprecedented.The Final ApprovalsThe Orioles and Major League Baseball needed permission from the United States government before any game could take place. Both Clinton and his secretary of state, Madeleine Albright, weighed in on the matter.ALDERSON What I recall was most fascinating was all the preliminary work, the advance work both in Washington and Havana. We went to the White House and talked with Sandy Berger, who was the national security adviser at the time. We went to the State Department.We didnt have to talk anyone into it, but there were clearly different elements of the government with different points of view. It was President Clinton and Peter Angelos who kind of rammed it through.The big issue was, what is going to happen to the revenue? Will it end up benefiting the Castro government? I kept saying, There isnt going to be any revenue because of the cost of the television production, the cost of transporting the players and the upgrade of the stadium and all the accommodations and so forth. And I heard that the average ticket price for the game was, like, 10 cents. Unfortunately, most of the attendees were probably party officials.Preparations For Game 1ALDERSON ESPN had already committed its schedule for the day we were considering. I remember they were willing to clear their schedule, but they werent willing to pay for anything, including the cost of the production, which I believe included bringing the equipment in from Florida.There were things that we were prohibited from bringing in that had to be brought from Canada; outfield padding, for instance. The whole stadium had to be upgraded, the turf, the dirt infield.Because of the sanctions, you couldnt bring in anything that was going to stay in the country. Everything you brought in had to stay with you, or if it stayed in Cuba, it had to be licensed or come from a third country. So a lot of the supplies, especially the groundskeeping equipment and supplies, came from Canada.Cuba Prepares, TooDANILO VALIENTE, now a Yankees coach, then the third-base coach for the Cuban national team (he spoke last week through an interpreter): Before the game, we were worried because in our league, we dont use wooden bats. We only had about 10 to 15 days to practice with wooden bats. There were a lot of expectations for us from the fans. They wanted us to do good and show our talent.Eventually we got used to it, but at the beginning, we broke a lot of bats.PETER SCHMUCK, a reporter for The Baltimore Sun, who accompanied the first delegation to Cuba: In order to get on the plane, I had to be listed as a special assistant to the owner, because the Cubans would not allow journalists. But they werent fooled. When we got there, a Cuban official came up to me and said, Welcome, Peter Schmuck, special assistant to Peter Angelos and reporter for The Baltimore Sun.The Americans Arrive,March 27, 1999ANDERSON I remember the smell of the country. It smelled good, if that doesnt sound too strange. It smelled like burnt orange peels.ANGELOS We landed in a darkened airport. We were coming in on a commercial flight, but they cleared us to land. Everything was dark. There was a bus there and an official from the Cuban government welcomed us very heartily, and we got on a bus and drove into Havana.What we witnessed was the capital of Cuba that was literally crumbling in the dust from the embargo that we had imposed upon the country.ALDERSON There were some hard-liners in their government who werent terribly thrilled with the whole idea. So, not everyone was happy to see the Americanos.There were a lot of intermediaries and translators. People were constantly saying, The room is bugged. It was like the Cold War. We had people pass us notes to take to the United States.The State DinnerThe night before the game, Cubas president, Fidel Castro, hosted a state dinner. His brother Raul was there, too.BUD SELIG, baseballs commissioner at the time: We got to the hotel and my wife said to me, I want to see downtown Havana on a Saturday night. The phone rang in our room and everything reminded me of my days in the 1950s because of what you saw, whether it was phones, hotels, cars, everything. This voice on the other end said, Palace, 7 oclock. I said to my wife, Well stay there for 15 or 20 minutes, meet him and then go. We get there and after about 45 minutes, in comes Fidel dressed exactly as you had seen him for 40 years. He invited us to stay for dinner.We didnt leave until 3 oclock in the morning. I could tell you it was a seven-course meal, but it might have been a 27-course meal; I lost track. There was a lot of conversation. It was a remarkable experience.ANGELOS We had a great time meeting with him and talking about the problems that we were both confronted with. We Americans, at least I did, felt we should get back together again, and he seemed very willing and eager to talk about that, although I told him clearly that I had no authority to discuss that. It was just a personal opinion.A number of owners came along with us. They had an absolute first-rate state dinner with Fidel. Raul was there, and it was very cordial, very nice and very positive. It was confirming what I was hoping for. The assumption that we could not get together was simply not a correct assessment.ALDERSON A bunch of other owners flew in on their own. We kept saying, You guys cannot fly in on your private planes, but they did anyway.We had the dinner with Castro. This guy is a historical figure, so it was interesting to meet him. Through his interpreter, the thing he wanted to know about was the baseball academies in the Dominican Republic. You could tell he was interested in the possibility of doing it there.I recall him saying that he was a better basketball player than baseball player, that a lot of the baseball stuff was apocryphal.The ProtestsA number of Cuban-born players and coaches, as well as some American politicians, opposed the trip on the grounds that it would strengthen Fidel Castros regime. Cookie Rojas was the third-base coach of the Mets at the time. Bobby Valentine was the manager of the Mets, and Rey Ordonez, a Cuban defector, was the teams shortstop. The Cuban-born Rafael Palmeiro was the Orioles designated hitter.COOKIE ROJAS I strongly disagreed with the decision because I did not want anything to support Castro. I thought it was a bad idea, so I decided to sit out in protest. I talked to Bobby Valentine and told him my feelings, and he said he respected my position and that he understood. Rey Ordonez did the same thing.ANDERSON I understood the protests. Rafael Palmeiro didnt go. It was a very polarizing issue, and it still is. But it was an attempt by a very forward-thinking owner, using baseball as a way to bridge a divide between two countries and normalize relations.ANGELOS I thought there could be some kind of reaction because Castro was characterized as a communist and in all kinds of negative ways.The GameThe Orioles beat Cuba, 3-2. Jose Contreras, who later defected to the United States, pitched eight scoreless innings in relief for Cuba, allowing only two hits and striking out 10. Cuba tied the score in the eighth inning on a run-scoring single by Omar Linares, and Harold Baines put the Orioles ahead for good with a base hit for the Orioles in the 11th.ALDERSON The Cubans should have won that game, as I recall.SELIG The atmosphere was very festive. I told my wife, I will sit with you and Peter. But this young assistant came over and he said that Fidel would like us to sit with him. I told my wife, You just got dumped for Fidel. So, thats where I sat, and I got a lot of mail from South Florida, which wasnt very pleasant. But it was obvious to me the guy loved baseball.ROJAS I did not watch. I had no interest whatsoever.ANDERSON We were there for a purpose. Baseball was a device to help foster good relations between two countries. But once the game started, it was all baseball. Your mind-set was no longer on the political ramifications. You were just concentrating on winning the game.ANGELOS When The Star-Spangled Banner was played, along with the Cuban anthem, Fidel stood up. There was no problem.VALIENTE The ballpark was completely full and the fans were very excited, jumping up and down, cheering. Eighth inning, runner on, Linares hit a ground-ball base hit and we tie the score, 2-2. I was jumping up and down, I was so excited. Unfortunately, we lost in the 11th.ANDERSON Contreras stood out. He clearly had major league stuff.The Postgame SpreadSELIG When the game is over, we go back and they put on a wonderful buffet.ANDERSON Alberto Juantorena was there. He is the only guy to win the gold in the 400 and 800 meters at the Olympics. If you knew anything about track and field, you knew who he was. I was always a huge track and field guy and I still am, so I was thrilled to meet him.The DepartureSELIG We had a little trouble getting out of Cuba. I have no idea what it was, but we got held at the airport. No one ever said what it was, but we waited a while and I was getting very restless, as I normally do. But we eventually got out of there.The Cubans Win in BaltimoreOn May 3, 1999, the Cubans traveled to Camden Yards in Baltimore for the return leg of the series and won, 12-6. The Cubans had planned to stay the night and leave the next day, but they mobilized their party ahead of schedule, presumably to thwart possible defections. One former player, who had become a team coach, did defect, and six others from the delegation, none of them players, missed the hastily arranged flight. But they returned home soon after.ALDERSON They were going to play the game that night in Baltimore and they were going to fly out the next morning. But they were so worried about defections that they decided to fly out that night after the game. They took people straight from the ballpark and rousted people out of the hotel and took off into the night, and they left about seven or eight people that they missed at the hotel. One of them defected.VALIENTE I really wanted to make the trip to Baltimore, but I could not get my visa. I was very sad.Postscript to the SeriesANGELOS I sent Castro an Oriole jacket with the No. 1 on it. He is a very committed baseball fan, and he could talk baseball like the professionals. I contacted him that way, and I would get messages from his local people in Washington, Why dont you come down again to Cuba?That was 1999. I am thankful that it has finally happened again, but that was what, 17 years ago? I didnt think it would take this long.SELIG I would like to think that it was an early precursor of what we have today. I thought it would happen sooner, but it didnt. It was, obviously, a very sensitive political issue. But Im delighted it is happening now.ALDERSON It was a lot of fun. It was exciting. I was sitting behind home plate with the commissioner and Castro was there sitting next to the commissioner. I was wearing a Baltimore Orioles cap, which I felt uneasy wearing, since I had been with Oakland for so long.SCHMUCK Being there and meeting the people, it changed my view of the embargo.VALIENTE We had a good understanding of how big it would be, but we did not have a lot of information. We sensed that it would be very big for Cuban sports. We thought we would have an opportunity to get to know each other, the players. But it did not really happen. We didnt have much interaction.ANDERSON Our owner was really forward-thinking. I mean, you see whats going on today. He was 17 years ahead of the curve.ROJAS Time cures everything.ANGELOS Thanks for calling. It brings back some pleasant memories."}
{"text": "The trial involving Gawker and Terry Bollea, better known as Hulk Hogan, over the publication of a sex video raised timeless legal questions about privacy and freedom of the press. The result, with the jury awarding Mr. Bollea $115 million in compensatory damages, could threaten Gawkers existence.But in many ways, the Gawker that posted the video  an aggressive and unpredictable news and gossip site  has already passed into memory. So, too, has an era of the web in which Gawker thrived.In the last few years, digital news sites with ambition  even the ones, like Gawker, that had originally hailed themselves as being anti-establishment  have undergone something of a self-correction. Vivid videos of random bedroom romps are out; a little bit of privacy is in.Readers, empowered by social media, have reshaped publications directly, by collective will. And they seem to realize that the photos and videos captured on their smartphones or elsewhere could just as easily be used against them as anyone else, including a celebrity.Now that everyone has a sex tape  and everyone is at risk of having their sex tape published online, the publication of celebrity sex tapes is less justified in the eyes of readers, said Max Read, a former editor of Gawker.The online world in which these sites operate, even compared with 2012 when Gawker posted the video of Mr. Bollea, is no longer the same. Visitors increasingly arrive from social platforms  mainly Facebook  and those readers have far more control of how a story is received.Pleasing stories can be shared and cheered on those social platforms. Behavior deemed bad can now be shunned with immediate results.The change was evident as the verdict came down on Friday.On Twitter and elsewhere, fans of Mr. Bollea and critics  including many journalists  enthusiastically cheered the potential death of Gawker. Some others, shocked at the size of the award, declared it a chilling moment for the press. (Legal experts suggest that the real influence of the case, in the event that this decision is upheld, would be narrow.)But in 2012, the vast majority of Twitter posts that linked to Gawkers video were lighthearted jokes  about Mr. Bolleas physique, about the humiliation of a childhood idol, about fame-seeking.The user @tsayvs, who did not provide a real identity, linked to Gawkers video the day after it was posted and called Gawkers description a masterpiece. After the verdict was announced and facing a cascade of messages from the affronted, he posted again: Am I the only one on Team Gawker here.If he was not alone, he sure seemed to have little company.A similar sense of outrage built in 2014, when hackers posted hundreds of photos obtained from celebrities private accounts. Publications that had previously trafficked in leaked nude photos  including Gawker Media properties and sites like BuzzFeed  shied away from publishing them.Instead, reporters covered the hack as news. Writers published essays examining the hack through the lens of privacy and consent; readers, frequently confronted with privacy worries of their own, were receptive.Today, the decision of whether to publish the most sensitive content often doesnt fall on publications or editors. It falls to online services that openly host videos and images, and to the social platforms on which videos and images spread.A video like the one that ran on Gawker might now appear on a site like LiveLeak, where people can post and distribute videos. Or it might be posted to a site like Vidme, a newer video host, or directly to Twitter, where it might be removed, only to surface again.File hosts and social networks are governed by individual terms of service.Imgur, an image site where photos from the celebrity iCloud hack were uploaded for a time, has rules that ban nonconsensual (revenge) porn.Twitters rules prohibit private and confidential information, including images or videos that are considered and treated as private under applicable laws  a matter of interpretation left first to the company.Facebook, which began hosting news last year, prohibits most nudity. In addition, its guidelines state, Descriptions of sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed.Having rules is one thing; enforcing them is another. Large platforms usually rely on a combination of employee oversight and user reporting to identify content that violates policy. Rules are enforced primarily through after-the-fact removal, not upfront moderation. Imgur, despite a ban, still hosts a large repository of sexual material.For media organizations, that means some of the most difficult decisions are limited to deciding if, and how, to acknowledge information that seems to publish itself.A hack in which content from Sonys internal network, including email, was posted online forced editors to choose whether to access and use information that was available to anyone with a web browser.Celebrity nude photos, posted by hackers, became a news story and jumping-off point for discussions about privacy and consent. Videos of violence involving police officers, some posted directly to platforms by citizens, forced the subject into view, reverberating around the country. ISIS circumvented news outlets by uploading videos directly to video hosts. Gatekeepers had become bystanders, controlling little beyond their own participation.Gawker appears to have accepted this new reality. In July, after the site outed a male media executive for messaging a male escort, Gawkers founder, Nick Denton, who is an outspoken critic of more conventional news outlets, had the post taken down. Some of his top editors revolted and left not long after. He then announced that the site should be 10 to 15 percent nicer.Just a month earlier, the companys editorial employees had voted to unionize. And in November, the site announced that it would focus on covering politics.The final legal outcome in the Hulk Hogan case may be years away. Whatever the result, it could end up not as a significant legal precedent, or as a landmark freedom of speech case, but as a curious artifact of a recent but nonetheless bygone era of web journalism."}
{"text": "On the day he planned to make baseball history, Luke Salas got a ride in a 1950s-era clunker of a car to a field that was little more than a sandlot, in a small town outside Havana.Salas, a Cuban-American former minor leaguer, had been training for a month with the provincial team there. Now, his father, a Havana native who fled the country with his family after Fidel Castro rose to power, was back in Cuba, watching from the slab of concrete behind home plate that passed for stands.It was the summer of 2012  more than two years before President Obama would announce the normalization of diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States  and Salas, 27, had set off for Cuba thinking baseball could help the divide between his homeland and that of his ancestors. He intended to be the first American to compete in its baseball leagues since the Cuban Revolution nearly six decades ago.In months of preparation, he had cleared a number of bureaucratic hurdles and secured the permission to make it possible. Or so he thought. Instead, minutes before the first pitch, a coach approached him in the dugout. An official in Cubas ministry of the interior had called. Salas could not play.With baseball a key piece of President Obamas historic visit to Cuba this week  he will attend an exhibition game Tuesday between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban national team  and as Major League Baseball continues its talks with Cuban sports officials about a new system for players to sign with American teams, Salas is a reminder that the pipeline of ballplayers might one day flow both ways.His story is also instructive of how difficult that might be, as baseball in Cuba remains fraught with politics.I thought I could play and it would be this great cultural exchange, Salas, 31, said recently. But I became a political hot potato.Still, Salas is a link between baseball on both sides of the Florida Straits. In the years since his attempt to play, he has maintained close contacts with Cuban baseball officials, and he is leading an effort to donate a million baseballs to Cuba. Back home, several major league franchises have reached out to him, curious about the world he infiltrated.I can still be a bridge, Salas said. And I want to be.Salas arrived in Havana four years ago with grand plans. He enrolled in a film school in San Antonio de los Baos, a half-hour drive southwest of downtown Havana, to ensure his visa, and his brothers Scott and Jake traveled alongside him to film a documentary, which will be released this year. Salas made connections with several members of Cubas sports ministry. One new friend, Alberto Juantorena, a Cuban gold medal winner in track at the 1976 Olympics, helped him navigate the governments red tape.The initial dream was to play for the Industriales, the Yankees of Cuba and the most visible team in its National Series, the rough equivalent of the major leagues there. But it was suggested that he shoot a bit lower. With the film school located in Artemisa province, a team there became the new target. It was essentially a minor league club, but he could then make the jump to Artemisas National Series team for the fall season.Salas was a four-year starter in the outfield at Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif., and he was blessed with a powerful left-handed swing. At his first practice in Cuba, he swatted several home runs before batting practice was halted. The team said that with equipment shortages, it could not afford to lose any more balls.The town, meanwhile, was riveted by Salas.Residents showed up to the stadium just to watch him practice. They stopped him on the street to introduce themselves. He also made quick friends with teammates  proof, he said, that baseball could be the kind of diplomacy he imagined.We talked about music and girls, said Salas, who speaks fluent Spanish. It was just like my teammates on every other team I ever played on.Added Osnaldo Garriga, a catcher on the team who has since moved to Florida: I realized it didnt matter if we were Cuban or American, we were friends and teammates.Besides, Garriga said, Luke was a very good ballplayer.Players were also intensely interested in Salass equipment: shiny sunglasses, metal cleats and the like.They had a hard time understanding that in the U.S., it was normal to go to a store and buy this stuff, Salas said.Everything was going well until the day of his official debut, when Salas was informed he could not play.Crushed, he frantically tried to meet with government and baseball officials to resolve the problem.He was told he needed to be a permanent Cuban resident, but when he returned in the fall with a residency card, thanks to the film school, he was still not allowed a tryout with Artemisa. The teams manager explained that he needed the governments permission. The government said it was the coachs decision.Salas still does not understand why the two sides could not reconcile  whether it was a bureaucratic mix-up or something more  but he never took the field.They didnt know what to do with me, Salas said. I think a lot of it was control. If they let me play, they couldnt control what might happen.There is a lesson here for Major League Baseball, Salas said. They call it the cuatro caras, the four faces of Cuba, he said. You never quite know who youre talking to or who is the ultimate decision-maker.Indeed, even as the Obama administration has paved the way for a new relationship between M.L.B. and the Cuban baseball federation, it remains unclear how the Cubans would structure an agreement to send their players to the major leagues.Despite its outcome, the novelty of Salass Cuban adventure brought intrigue from all corners of American life when he returned.State Department officials called him into their offices in Washington and told him that if he continued his efforts, he would violate the United States embargo of Cuba, be fined $250,000 and risk jail time. The rules on travel to Cuba and engaging in commerce were much stricter then than they are now, since Obama loosened them, but many regulatory obstacles remain.Production companies approached him about a reality television show if he ever went back to Cuba to play ball. Major league teams, meanwhile, wanted intelligence on talented players on the island, and advice on where to build academies if, and when, they are one day allowed into Cuba.There was so much interest in the Cuban talent, Salas said.Salas grew up in Malibu, where his Cuban heritage was part of his childhood. He is a descendant of Cesar Salas, a revolutionary alongside Cubas national hero Jose Marti. Both died in the war of independence against Spain at the end of the 19th century.Luke Salass father, Hank, left Cuba when he was 9 years old with his parents after Castro assumed power, but he never preached hatred of the regime. He took his family to Cuba in the late 1990s, and his son felt an immediate connection.I knew I wanted to go back, Luke Salas said.After Pepperdine, Salas signed with the Texas Rangers in the summer of 2007 and played with their Class A affiliate. He was cut after spring training the next year and returned to Pepperdine to get a graduate degree in public policy. The day after he signed the paperwork to enroll, he got an invitation to join the minor league system of the Seattle Mariners. He declined.He saw a different path, Hank Salas said. He saw a way to use baseball that was much bigger.The documentary about Luke Salass efforts, The Cuban Dream, is intended to help bring attention to the baseball donation effort, which he said has the full support of the Cuban baseball federation and sports ministry.He intends to visit Cuba in April to discuss his charity plans, which he thinks are vital to aiding the struggling baseball infrastructure there, and will, in turn, help baseball grow globally.Baseball needs Cuba, which is double the size of the Dominican Republic, to be a strong baseball country, he said, noting the growing influence of soccer on the island. It starts with baseballs, then bats and gloves and spikes, and giving kids an opportunity to go out and practice and play.Salas no longer daydreams about suiting up for Industriales or even Artemisa. Today, he imagines American equipment reinvigorating the game and leading a baseball renaissance in Cuba  and maybe one day a winter league on the island, and young Cubans earning scholarships to play ball at American colleges.My playing days are probably over, he said. But there are other dreams for Cuba."}
{"text": "Canadas new Liberal government, in a budget to be released on Tuesday, will try to revive a flagging economy with one of the countrys biggest deficits since the 2008 financial crisis. Prime Minister Justin Trudeaus government is expected to run a deficit of about 30 billion Canadian dollars, or $22.9 billion, with a focus on infrastructure spending that it hopes will spur hiring and growth. The drop in the price of oil, a major export for Canada, has battered the economy, putting it in a brief recession last year and forcing the Bank of Canada to cut rates twice in 2015. The government warned last month that it would run bigger deficits than it had anticipated because of the weak growth outlook."}
{"text": "Like procreating or planting flowers or even just exfoliating your skin with a washcloth, spring cleaning is a process of renewal that is available, in some form, to every human on earth.Its also a shared experience that can be profoundly solitary: We clean and declutter alone, even if we do it alongside friends or family. Only you, after all, are equipped to make a decision about the memorabilia that haunts your closet  the striped shirt swiped from a college boyfriend 10 years ago, the vintage Mongolian fur hat that makes you look demented or fanciful depending on your coat, the questionable brogues.I cleaned out my closet last week and, in a torrent of frenzied decontamination, went overboard with the purging and donating.When I finished, every streak of color was gone. The remaining clothes were white, beige or black. My closet looked like a hotel lobby bathroom. It had a soporific effect. It needed seasoning.What to do?Why, add a few spicy morsels, of course. The new Sonia Rykiel store uptown seemed like a potential source of invigorating agents. The French label is known for its kicky striped knitwear, a look popularized by Ms. Rykiel in the early 1960s.In 2014, Julie de Libran was appointed artistic director after the label waffled in the wake of its founders departure as creative director. Ms. de Libran has injected fresh life with her playful, print-happy collections.Now she has opened a store on Madison Avenue  and not just a store, but a grand gesture: 2,000 square feet of stomping ground on one of the ritzier blocks in Upper East Side shopping territory, right across from Lanvin and Dolce & Gabbana.With its apple-red lacquered walls and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, the store is eye-catching in a way that makes passers-by halt, whip off their sunglasses and peer inside. The air is scented with a rosewater-tinged infusion (It comes in through the air-conditioners, a saleswoman whispered), and the shelves are stocked with vintage paperbacks by Franoise Sagan, Stendhal, Victor Hugo and Andr Malraux.A custom carpet is woven with cartoonish books, pencils, eyeballs, lips and cigarettes, which is the first time in years that Ive seen a non-cigarette brand acknowledge the existence of cigarettes. (An American version of this carpet would feature an iPhone, a green juice and a turmeric supplement. I like Rykiels rendition.)The clothing stands up to its environment. I zoomed in on a rack of grapefruit-size pompoms made from turkey feathers dyed in acid-trip hues: banana, fern, cerulean ($220). The pompoms were affixed to either a silk ribbon or an oversize safety pin. They weighed nothing.How would a person wear this? I asked a saleswoman.On the runway, they wore them on the wrist, she said, demonstrating the accessorys placement like a flight attendant miming safety procedures. Or you can wear them in your hair (she mimed this, too), or on a bag (mimed) or  this is my favorite place  right on your shoulder.In theory the shoulder seems like an odd place for a single pompom, but the saleswomans demonstration was compelling.I love fuzzy things, she said.Me, too.Other items offered a similarly multisensory experience, like a pair of glitter-encrusted tennis shoes ($425) and a fluttering pleated dress ($2,190) in creamsicle polyester (though it should have been chiffon, at that price).A tweedy cropped jacket with rainbow stripes ($1,490) looked edible on the rack  like precisely the right element to wear with jeans or to work over a silk dress  and the saleswoman slid it onto my shoulders. I had been semiconsciously shedding layers and she had correctly interpreted the momentum of my stripping. I looked in the mirror. Oh, dear. On a taller person, the fit would have been slouchy. I looked like a garden gnome.Maybe with slimmer pants, it would work, I thought. Maybe with some tailoring. But the tailoring would need to be intensive. I bid goodbye to the jacket and assured myself that I could always return to it online. You can find most of the stores items online, though Rykiels e-commerce presentation is a low-fat plain-yogurt version of the stores ice cream sundae.Sonia Rykiel has made uncomplicated clothes for the complicated modern woman, a writer said in a 1982 profile in The New York Times. This is still true (a buffet of fine-knit striped Rykiel sweaters would sate any traditionalist), although the target woman may skew younger in 2016. A well-financed woman could buy a lot of fun but not-inappropriate gifts here for her teenage daughter or niece.This occurred to me as a woman and her teenage daughter wandered inside. The teenager moved pompomward. Her mother gazed at the stores vast array of books.There must be thousands, she murmured.There are, a saleswoman confirmed. Feel free to borrow anything youd like to read.Really? the woman squawked.(I squawked, too. Mentally. When is anything offered on sheer trust in New York?)Really, the saleswoman replied. Why not?"}
{"text": "The data and analytics providers IHS and Markit have agreed to combine in an all-stock transaction that will take IHS, which is based in Colorado, to London.IHSs shareholders will own 57 percent of the combined company  to be known as IHS Markit  and Markits shareholders will own the remaining 43 percent, according to a news release on Monday. IHS Markit would have more than 50,000 customers.This transformational merger brings together two information-rich companies to create a powerful provider of unique business intelligence, data and analytics to a broad and complementary customer base, Jerre Stead, the IHS chairman and chief executive, said in the statement. IHS Markit and its shareholders will benefit from enhanced product innovation to deliver strong returns across economic cycles.Technically, the deal is a tax inversion, where an American company merges with a foreign one to lower its tax bill. However, IHSs tax rate may not change much; it was about 20.5 percent for the year through November, and the combined company is expecting a tax rate in the low- to mid-20 percent range, according to the statement.IHS provides research and analytics to businesses and customers in the energy, transportation and technology, media and telecommunications industries. Challenges facing the energy sector, as declines in commodities prices have caused distress and bankruptcies, cut into IHSs revenue in 2015. Nonsubscription revenue declined 27 percent, according to the companys most recent filing. Merging with Markit, which focuses largely on the financial industry, would help IHS diversify away from energy.IHS was founded in 1959 as Information Handling Services to provide information for aerospace engineers through microfilm databases. The company grew and diversified through a series of acquisitions to become the largest commercial producer of microfilm products by 1988. It began moving its databases online in 1995 and expanded into consulting and government markets.Markit was founded 13 years ago to provide prices for credit default swaps, and it quickly garnered investments from financial firms such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. The company provides pricing information on many different types of securities, as well as processes derivatives, foreign exchange and syndicated loans. Markit also creates software to help customers calculate risk.Mr. Stead was the chief executive of IHS from 2006 to 2013 and returned in June as chief executive after the resignation of Scott Key.Mr. Stead said on a conference call Monday that he began speaking with Lance Uggla, the chairman and chief executive of Markit, around the time of Markits $1.3 billion initial public offering in June 2014. The two met for breakfast in December for a serious discussion about what a combination of their two companies might look like. Those talks continued through the holidays and eventually reached the deal that was announced on Monday.Shares of IHS traded up 6.8 percent Monday morning, and shares of Markit rose 9.9 percent.Shareholders in IHS, which has its headquarters in Englewood, Colo., will receive 3.5566 shares of IHS Markit for each share of common stock they own. Based on Fridays closing prices, that implies $31.13 a share of Markit, a 5.6 percent premium. The acquisition values Markit at $5.5 billion, based on 176.8 million shares outstanding.Mr. Stead will become the chairman and chief executive of IHS Markit. Mr. Uggla will be the president and a board member. Once Mr. Stead retires, on Dec. 31, 2017, Mr. Uggla will assume the roles of chairman and chief executive at IHS Markit.The board of directors will have 11 members, of which six are designated by IHS and the rest by Markit.IHS Markit will conduct a $1 billion share repurchase program in 2017, as well as in 2018. IHS Markit will have $800 million in free cash flow and about $3.3 billion in annual revenue.The combination will enhance cash flow and enable stronger returns of capital to shareholders, Mr. Uggla said in the statement.The companies expect to have $125 million in cost reductions by the end of 2019, through areas like technology and real estate. The transaction will be immediately accretive to earnings, the companies said, and is expected to close during the second half of the year.IHSs lead financial adviser was M. Klein & Company, along with Goldman Sachs. Markits financial adviser was JPMorgan. Weil, Gotshal & Manges provided legal advice to IHS, while Davis Polk & Wardwell gave legal counsel to Markit."}

{"text": "BOCA RATON, Fla.   Eager to expand its footprint internationally to generate more revenue, the N.F.L. plans to play a regular-season game in China as early as 2018.Immense logistics must be solved, including finding a suitable stadium and teams that want to play in Asia, and determining a kickoff time that would allow fans in the United States to watch the game at a reasonable hour.But the leagues 32 owners, who are holding their annual meeting this week, view overseas markets as ripe for expansion. The league already plays three games a year in London, and this season, it will return to Mexico City for the first time in more than a decade.On Sunday, N.F.L. executives told the owners that the fastest way to reach the commissioners target of $25 billion in annual revenue was by expanding digital offerings like games streamed over the Internet and through developing the N.F.L.s brand outside North America.Ive always felt if you look at what weve achieved in the U.S., if you could take just a fraction of that globally, then the upside has to be incredible, said Mark Waller, who runs the leagues international operations.The N.F.L. canceled a planned preseason game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks in China in 2007 as it turned its attention to developing the market in Britain.The league now feels that after spending a decade developing its brand there, it is ready to expand elsewhere. The N.F.L. has 23 television and digital partners in China and about 17 million fans measured by those who follow the league online. About half a million fans watch Sunday Night Football in China, where the game is broadcast on Monday morning.Taking games to China will be more difficult. The league will have to decide whether to play in Beijing, the capital, or Shanghai, the countrys financial center.The Rams, who were granted the right to move to Los Angeles in January, agreed to give up one home game a year for the three years it plays in the Los Angeles Coliseum. The team is open to playing in China, and several other teams have shown interest in playing a road game there.Playing in China, though, will not happen soon. Any stadium would have to accommodate two N.F.L. teams, practice sites would have to be found, and scheduling conflicts would have to be solved.To do it well in China, its not a one-year preparation, Waller said. From a planning perspective, local government perspective and from the logistics and broadcast perspective, theres a lot of work to be done.PATRIOTS SEEK REDRESS The New England Patriots owner, Robert K. Kraft, said he sent Commissioner Roger Goodell a letter more than a month ago asking him to consider returning the draft picks he took from the team last year.Goodell fined the team $1 million and took away two draft picks, including the teams first-round draft pick this year, as penalty for the teams role in deflating footballs used in the A.F.C. championship game in 2015.Tom Brady was suspended for four games, but a District Court judge later overturned the penalty. Kraft suggested that the commissioner had yet to reply to his letter.LURING ANOTHER SUPER BOWL The owners of the Jets and the Giants said they would like to bring another Super Bowl to the New York-New Jersey area.Woody Johnson, the Jets owner, and Steve Tisch, the Giants co-owner, said that Super Bowl XLVIII was a success and that the metropolitan area was a popular destination for fans and the N.F.L.The next two Super Bowls are in Houston and Minneapolis.APPAREL DEAL EXTENDED The N.F.L. extended its deal with Fanatics.com, which runs the leagues online shops, for at least 10 more years. The league has also taken an undisclosed equity stake in the company, according to a source familiar with the deal. That stake could become valuable if the company went public.Fanatics.com also acquired the licensing rights so it can produce merchandise commemorating specific plays or games."}

{"text": "A week after an installment that was more mind game than action yarn, it was back to the run-and-gun style on Mondays episode of Blindspot. One of Janes tattoos led the F.B.I. team to a sex-trafficking ring and a race against the clock to keep an innocent man from being executed.The episode efficiently pushed assorted pulse-pounding buttons: women in jeopardy, a harrowing rescue from a burning building, a wrongful execution narrowly averted. But the most noteworthy thing was that Jane took a back seat and the underused Zapata got to do some heavy lifting.She went undercover as a potential trafficking victim, and Audrey Esparza, who plays the role, handled the additional camera time well. There were moments when I thought Zapata was going to be killed off in the episode  with her gambling debts still looming and now a federal prosecutor breathing down her neck, she is in an increasingly intractable position, which sometimes in television leads to a characters abrupt demise because the writers have written themselves into a box.But Zapata survived, and near the episodes end she got to remind Jane, who had been thinking of calling it quits, that rescuing trafficking victims is the kind of thing that makes an F.B.I. agents job worth doing. This work is bigger than us, she said.The trafficking-and-exoneration plot was compelling, but it only further muddied the waters. If it seemed as if the tattooed clues were all working toward the collective goal of, say, national security, this case was a different animal, more of a personal rescue mission for the guy who was about to be executed. So, once again, one step forward, two steps back.And with that, well step back ourselves: This will be our final recap of Blindspot. The mysteries of Janes tattoos are fascinating but not, apparently, comment-inducing, so well look for something with more reader interest. Thanks to those of you who did read or weigh in."}
{"text": "BRUSSELS  The attacks on the airport and a subway station in Brussels on Tuesday have intensified questions about the Belgian authorities ability to thwart terror in the city. This article, published on Monday, examines how the lone surviving suspect from the Paris terror attacks in November managed to elude capture for months afterward.For 125 days, the authorities in Belgium had failed to find Salah Abdeslam, the most wanted man in Europe, though they strongly believed he was holed up in or near the insular immigrant section of Brussels where he had grown up.They raided dozens of homes in the neighborhood, known as Molenbeek, as they hunted down Mr. Abdeslam, one of the 10 men suspected of carrying out the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris and the only one still alive. They rounded up his friends and fellow drug dealers and thieves, and interrogated members of his family.They thought one night that they might have him cornered, but were paralyzed by a law prohibiting nighttime raids. When they moved in the next morning, he was nowhere to be seen. They deployed a drone to help in the hunt. Clues to Mr. Abdeslams continued presence, including his fingerprints, started to seem more mocking than tantalizing.Then, last week, the police got at least two breaks  one a result of efforts to monitor Mr. Abdeslams cellphone use, the other possibly through shoe-leather surveillance  that allowed them to bring the manhunt to a close.In the end, Mr. Abdeslam was captured coming out of a building only 100 yards from where, the police believe, he had hidden immediately after fleeing Paris four months ago and barely a 10-minute walk from his mothers house, raising further questions about the well-documented shortcomings of Belgiums counterterrorism efforts.Yet the case has also brought to life the extreme challenge this country faces in addressing the threat from Islamists living in the heart of the European Unions capital city, as well as the problems that security officials face in penetrating Muslim cultures imported wholesale into Western societies. And it has left some unresolved mysteries in its wake, not least whether Mr. Abdeslam was a frightened young man who got in over his head or a determined terrorist who continued to plot further assaults up until he was captured.Mr. Abdeslam, 26, handled logistics for the Paris attackers. He was the fixer, renting cars, finding apartments, picking people up and dropping them off. Like his brother Ibrahim  who was among the attackers and blew himself up in a Paris cafe  he was supposed to die on Nov. 13. Instead, Salah Abdeslam, who told the police that he had wanted to blow himself up at the national soccer stadium north of Paris, lost his nerve and, according to French investigators, made a panicked call to friends in Brussels asking to be picked up and taken home in the hours after the attack, before the authorities learned his identity.The neighborhood he returned to, Molenbeek, is a working-class district, where mosques outnumber churches, cafes specialize in scalding hot tea vibrant with fresh mint and many women wear hijab. Mr. Abdeslams Molenbeek was an even more insular sub-community, made up of small-time drug dealers and petty criminals, unemployed young men with few prospects.It was this Molenbeek that sustained him before and after the attacks. Much of Mr. Abdeslams life was spent within a mile of his mothers house. A half-hour walk away was the bar he and Ibrahim ran until it was closed just two weeks before the attacks. It was a place where young men traded in illegal drugs, drank tea and watched extremist videos of fighting in Syria.Many of the first- and second-generation immigrants in Molenbeek, especially those living near a canal that separates the district from wealthier central Brussels, have roots, like the Abdeslam family, in Morocco. One of the busiest shops in the area has pay telephone booths for long-distance calls and computers because some Molenbeek residents cannot afford international calling plans or Internet service.It can seem at times as if a community has migrated to Belgium with its customs, loyalties and language intact, putting a premium on family ties and fostering an insularity that made finding Mr. Abdeslam that much harder. Johan Leman, an anthropologist who works in Molenbeek, said the atmosphere resembled the culture of omert, the code of silence followed by the Mafia.Upon his return from Paris, the authorities said, Mr. Abdeslam went underground, hidden by friends and family, staying mostly in the area but moving around and relying on others to bring him food.It was a pre-existing network that came together to do small time trafficking or other things and it was at least partly used to help in Salah Abdeslams flight, Frdric Van Leeuw, the Belgium federal prosecutor, said on Belgian television on Saturday.But Mr. Abdeslam also retained close links while in hiding to other men who appear to have been involved in planning the Paris attacks and possibly trained by the Islamic State in Syria. That association suggests Mr. Abdeslam may not have given up on engaging in further terrorist activities, and that the militants in Belgium had not yet dismissed him as unwilling to give his life for their cause.The turning point in the case came last week when the police raided an apartment about six miles from Molenbeek, seeking clues but believing it to be empty.Instead, they were met with gunfire. They killed the gunman, Mohamed Belkaid, a 35-year-old Algerian who had already been linked to the Paris plot. But two men escaped. And when the police entered the apartment, they found large quantities of ammunition, an Islamic State flag  and Mr. Abdeslams fingerprints.There was no electricity, no water, no gas, said Ahmed El Khannouss, the deputy mayor of Molenbeek. He was living in catastrophically unhygienic conditions.Convinced that Mr. Abdeslam had  slipped away, the authorities intensified their hunt. Around the same time, Mr. Abdeslam appears to have made a big mistake, using a cellphone known to the authorities that he had not used for some time, said Pieter Van Ostaeyen, an expert on extremist networks in Belgium.It was basically because Salah Abdeslam activated his cellphone and the number was known to the police and then they knew his location geographically, Mr. Van Ostaeyen said.On Thursday, Ibrahim Abdeslam was buried in an unmarked grave in an ecumenical cemetery in Brussels, nearly 18 weeks after his death. The short funeral service took place under heavy surveillance, and the 20 men who attended it were identified and most likely being watched by the authorities from then on if they were not already, neighbors said.Among the attendees was Abid Aberkan, who Mr. El Khannouss said was a cousin of the Abdeslam brothers. It was to a Molenbeek apartment used by Mr. Aberkans family that Mr. Abdeslam went at some point after the raid. And on Friday, the police targeted that apartment in a raid that ended when Mr. Abdeslam sprinted into the street from the doorway, wearing a hoodie; he was shot in the leg by the police and taken into custody.What finally gave Mr. Abdeslam away, a spokesman for the Paris prosecutors office said, was a combination of telephony and surveillance.Mr. Abdeslam began talking to interrogators over the weekend, and France is seeking his extradition. It remains unclear how ideologically committed he was to the Islamic State, the terrorist group also known as ISIS and ISIL. His role went unmentioned in the organizations social media propaganda after the Paris attacks. There is no evidence that he tried to get to Syria. Mr. El Khannouss, the Molenbeek deputy mayor, described him as someone trying to fill shoes that were too big for him.Yet up until his capture, Mr. Abdeslam appears to have been among more hardened jihadists. Mr. Belkaid, the Algerian killed in the gunfight with the police, is suspected of wiring money to help finance the Paris plot.As the police were capturing Mr. Abdeslam on Friday, they were arresting a man whose real name they do not know yet, but since they also found false papers during the raid in the name of Amine Choukri and another set in the name of Monir Ahmed Alaaj, it is possible that he was using one or both of those names.Mr. Abdeslam, who traveled to Budapest twice last fall before the Paris attacks to pick up several men at a time when tens of thousands of undocumented migrants were streaming through Europe each week, was stopped by the police in October in Germany with a man traveling under the name Amine Choukri.On Monday, the Belgian authorities identified another man they suspect of being an accomplice of Mr. Abdeslams: Najim Laachraoui, 24, a Belgian citizen who went to Syria in February 2013. Mr. Laachraoui, using the name Soufiane Kayal, was one of two men  Mr. Belkaid was the other  with fake Belgian identity cards who were with Mr. Abdeslam on Sept. 9 as they passed through a checkpoint between Hungary and Austria.In Molenbeeks teahouses, it is hard to get anyone to say much about Mr. Abdeslam or his capture. Men walk outside rather than speak to outsiders.That does not make them jihad supporters, said Mr. Leman, the anthropologist. Even if they disapprove of what someone did in family, he said, they feel it should be dealt with internally."}
{"text": "We all like to act as if were immune to the vitriol of haters. Its almost cool to pretend that it doesnt affect us, like were all bulletproof and have some kind of armor against it.And while that might be a helpful coping mechanism, its not really true for most of us. The truth is that this stuff really hurts. Whats more, if you dont deal with it in the proper way, it can have a major impact on your ability to do work that matters in the world.I was displaying some of my sketches recently at a fantastic community art center, the Center of Creative Arts in St. Louis. There were a couple of events, and Once Films was there to help capture the show.While the film crew set up, I wandered over to a table near the gallery entrance and noticed a guest book. It was set up so people could comment on the work. I remember thinking, Oh, this will be great. I cant wait to see what people think of my work, and I opened the book.Most people would just write their names, where they were from and a friendly or positive comment. But what stuck out most were three not-so-nice reviews. Chris Ryan, a principal and producer/director at Once Films, came over to me as I sat there reading and rereading these three comments. I said, Can you believe this? and started reading them out loud.I expected him to say something supportive, or to tell me not to worry about it. But instead he said, Oh man, why dont we catch some video of you reading this, like Jimmy Kimmels mean tweets? You may have seen these videos, in which the Mr. Kimmel, the talk-show host, has people read mean tweets about themselves on the air. One of my favorites is President Obamas, but Jimmy has had a lot of people do it, and theyre all excellent and funny.So I said O.K., and I read those mean comments. Heres the result.I might look like Im unaffected by the whole thing. You may see some of that armor I was talking about. But I wasnt taking it lightly at all. Inside, I was really upset.Ive dealt with a lot of public criticism, because I do a lot of public work. So you would think that I would be immune to the hate by now. Im not talking about the hate that you find in the Merriam-Webster dictionary. Im talking about hate as defined by Urban Dictionary: A special kind of love given to people who suck.And while that definition is crass, thats what makes it perfect. This hate is the stuff of haters. Its mean, unconstructive and intended to cause the subject anger or pain. I didnt want it to inhibit my ability to do difficult, meaningful, creative work. Anyone who does let it get to them runs the risk of it affecting their career and income.Consider the following possible responses:Ignore it. Simply try your best not to see the hate. I should have known what I was going to see in that book, but I went and looked anyway. Dont do that. As much as you can, just turn a blind eye to the hate that you know will be there when you do something creative or controversial.Analyze it. O.K., so youll probably catch wind of the hate somehow, either through social media, blog posts or somewhere else. But when you do find yourself confronted with it, take a moment to evaluate it for any sign of constructive criticism. Usually theres not much there, but sometimes there is. So read it once, take a break, then read it again. Glean whatever you can from it to help improve your work.Shake it off. This is where you might start reciting those Taylor Swift lyrics. Youve tried to ignore it, youve gotten what you could from the arguments youve read, so now you can just dismiss the rest of it. Whats left really doesnt matter. Haters gonna hate. So shake it off.Deal with it. After youve done your best to simply brush the hate aside, the painful truth is that youll probably still find yourself bothered by the comments. When you find yourself at this Level 4 pain, dont be surprised that it still hurts. If you arent surprised, then you wont be shocked. And if youre not shocked, theres a good chance you wont be stopped from doing your really important work. Its not going to make the hate less painful, but it will help you move forward.And thats the important thing  move forward. I know too many people who have gone out on a limb and said to the world, Here, I made this thing and then gotten really negative feedback and just quit. Or maybe they toned it down, changed their rhetoric, backed off a little or capitulated. Whatever you want to call it, they gave in to the haters, and their work suffered as a result. The important thing is to avoid letting that happen. Period.Its impossible for you to do anything that matters on any scale and not have somebody say they dont like it. Its just not going to happen. The world is too big, too connected, and there are too many opinions available at a moments notice for meaningful work to never raise somebody elses eyebrow. Part of dealing with this is simply reminding yourself that its simply part of the deal. When you sign up to do work that matters, understand that youre also signing up to have somebody hate on it.When it does come, dont take it as a sign that something is wrong. Take it as a sign that something is right. It is fuel to continue your work, not a giant stop sign."}
{"text": "Bees buzzing, flowers blooming and birds singing are some telltale signs that spring is upon us. But do you ever wonder what the season looks like from space?This image from the Meteosat-9 satellite shows Earth on the vernal equinox, the official start of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. This year, that day fell on Sunday, March 20, as it did in this photograph taken in 2011.The spring equinox is a point in Earths orbit where the sun shines directly above the Equator, creating nearly equal periods of daytime and nighttime across the globe.Only on the equinoxes do we get that exactly straight terminator, said Greg Redfern, a solar system ambassador at NASAs Jet Propulsion Laboratory, referring to the line separating daylight from the darkness of night.That line is continually shifting because Earth is tilted 23.5 degrees on its axis. If the Earth didnt have that tilt, wed always have the straight-up-and-down terminator and we wouldnt have seasons, Mr. Redfern said.You can see how the terminator shifts during all four seasons in this video from the Meteosat-9 satellite, which begins in September near the time of the fall equinox. As the Northern Hemisphere approaches winter, it leans away from the sun and receives less daylight  making the terminator appear slanted. After the spring equinox, the Northern Hemisphere gradually starts tilting toward the suns rays, making days longer and warmer."}
{"text": "Gary Johnson has climbed Mount Everest before.This is not a metaphor about how hard it is to operate outside our two-party system. Its a real thing that a presidential candidate has done. It just happens to also work, you know, as a metaphor.Gary Johnson is the former Republican governor of New Mexico. During his two terms in office, he slashed the state budget while pushing for tax cuts, school vouchers and the legalization of marijuana. In 2003, after he left office, and shortly after breaking his leg, he climbed Mount Everest  the stuff of campaign ad makers dreams.Now, as the presumptive presidential nominee of the Libertarian Party, Mr. Johnson is facing another daunting task: getting attention, and votes, as a third-party presidential candidate.In a normal election year, Mr. Johnsons candidacy would garner about as much publicity and respect as any third-party candidates, which is to say, close to zero. But this time is different. The Republican Party appears to be eating its own tail, with millions of voters lining up for a candidate that many party leaders find morally and politically reprehensible. And now, in retaliation, some of those party leaders are starting to look for their own Naderian spoiler candidate to prevent Donald J. Trump from winning the presidency.Last Thursday, three influential conservative activists convened a meeting of anti-Trump Republicans in Washington to discuss the feasibility of running a third-party candidate. According to The Washington Post, the tone of the meeting was muted and downbeat  perhaps a sign of the resignation party elites are feeling as they realize Mr. Trump is likely to be their nominee.The anti-Trump, anti-Hillary Clinton crowd isnt out of options just yet. Some have suggested putting up an independent candidate, or going all in for Senator Ted Cruz. But an absurd, unpredictable election season sometimes merits an equally absurd, unpredictable response. Thats where Mr. Johnson comes in.As the Libertarian Partys presidential nominee in 2012, he won around 1 percent of the popular vote. If he somehow were elected president, he would be the first commander in chief to have posed shirtless in GQ and served as the chief executive of a medical cannabis company.Its unlikely that Republican elites would ever rally round someone like Mr. Johnson. But as a firewall to prevent Mr. Trump from taking over the Oval Office, the Libertarian Party nominee  whom they disagree with on many subjects  may be their best shot.The biggest hurdle anti-Trump Republicans must overcome, aside from finding a candidate willing to go into the wilderness for them, is getting on the ballot. The presidential election system is a patchwork of state deadlines and ballot requirements. Ralph Nader, who critics say helped usher George W. Bush into the White House by running as a Green Party candidate in 2000, is extremely familiar with the ballot requirements, having been booted off the Pennsylvania ballot in 2004. While Mr. Nader is happy to rail against the two-party tyranny of the American electoral system, he thinks starting a third-party run at this point in the election season a near-impossible goal.Its almost too late, unless youre a multibillionaire, Mr. Nader said. Other than just a tailored two- or three-state approach, I dont see it happening.Even if anti-Trump forces are able to put a third-party candidate on the ballot, it is a limited victory: Ensure Mr. Trump loses, while also ensuring Republicans split their votes and get another Democrat elected.After Mr. Johnson earns his partys nomination for a second time, which he appears likely to do, his key challenge will be making it to the debate stage. Last year, the Libertarian Party and the Green Party filed a lawsuit against the Commission on Presidential Debates to change the national polling threshold that dictates that only candidates polling at 15 percent or higher can join in.There is no way that a third party wins the presidency without being in the presidential debate, Mr. Johnson said. The contention is on our part that if youre on the ballot in enough states to mathematically be elected, then you should be included in the presidential debate.He pointed out that, unlike whichever independent candidate anti-Trump Republicans are thinking of putting up against Mr. Trump, the Libertarian Party  which will host its nominating convention in Orlando, Fla., over Memorial Day  will be on the ballot in all 50 states come November.Theres not another third party. Theres not. Its just not going to happen, he said, then added, It could be me!Mr. Trump has played the primary process masterfully, staging his coup from within the palace walls. He capitalized on the very rules the Republican National Committee changed after the drawn-out 2012 primary election to make more states award their delegates as winner-take-all rather than proportionally.Instead of ousting Mr. Trump and forcing him to run as a third-party candidate, Republican elites now find themselves, or their preferred candidates, losing control of their own party. After the meeting of anti-Trump conservatives last Thursday, one of the meetings organizers, the right-wing radio host Erick Erickson, put out a statement from the group.We intend to keep our options open as to other avenues to oppose Donald Trump, he wrote. Our multiple decades of work in the conservative movement for free markets, limited government, national defense, religious liberty, life and marriage are about ideas, not necessarily parties.It is noteworthy that Mr. Trump is running a campaign safely within the two-party system, considering he is a Voltron-like candidate built using the most successful parts of past independent campaigns.Like George Wallace, the former Alabama governor who ran a third-party presidential campaign in 1968 after his segregationist views put him on the fringes of the Democratic Party, Mr. Trump uses strident racial language to stoke his supporters anger. Like Ross Perot, who won 19 percent of the popular vote as an independent in 1992, Mr. Trump is an eccentric billionaire who is fun to watch on TV, which has allowed him to move ahead without relying on traditional fund-raising channels. Like Pat Buchanan, the Reform Party candidate in 2000, he is repackaging warmed-over economic and cultural nationalism and selling it as the future of the conservative movement. Mr. Trump even has a bit of Teddy Roosevelt, whose penchant for strongman bluster made him a populist hero when he ran as the Progressive (a.k.a. Bull Moose) Party candidate in 1912.For now, the Republican Partys leaders are trying to maintain some semblance of control over whats happening to them. Appearing on ABCs This Week on Sunday, Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said it was both too early and too late for his party to think about starting an independent bid.The host, George Stephanopoulos, asked Mr. Priebus what he thought of the Stop Trump movement, and whether recruiting a third-party candidate would doom the Republican chances of winning back the White House. Well, sure it would  of course it would, he said. But it isnt likely, and its probably too late, and there is no definitive answer right now as to who the nominee is going to be of our party. So I think all of its far too early.Its Schrdingers primary now: both alive and dead, too early to speculate about and too late to save. Worst of all, the anti-Trump movements only hope to save the party might be a Libertarian. According to Julia Azari, a professor of political science at Marquette University, a Trump victory would actually prove worse for the Republican Party in the long run than another Democratic presidency.Parties are not just labels, theyre not just ideas, she said. Theyre institutions, and theyre institutions that do have people in them that have some sense of their longevity and also their integrity. Trump could run and lose, and the Republican Party could potentially move on from that. If he runs and wins, thats really the nightmare scenario.Mr. Johnson doesnt appear to be too concerned about the integrity of his former party, though he finds Mr. Trumps rise as maddening as the anti-Trump crowd does. Mr. Johnson cites his experience in 2012, where he ran for the Republican nomination before going after the Libertarian one: Thirty percent of Republicans believe the scourge of the earth is Mexican immigration, he said. It was my voice saying, Youre wrong. That theyre the cream of the crop when it comes to workers. That theyre not taking jobs that U.S. citizens want.He added: And the fence is crazy. Its asinine.The more he talks, the more the #NeverTrump forces might hear something they like.And Gary Johnson has a campaign slogan ready: It could be me!"}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   The Pentagon acknowledged on Monday that it had established a small base in northern Iraq staffed solely by American Marines, a disclosure that followed an Islamic State rocket attack over the weekend that killed one Marine and wounded several others.The White House has contended that the military is not conducting a ground combat mission in Iraq. But the new outpost has long-range artillery that can help Iraqi forces as they try to reclaim land from the Islamic State.The base was attacked again on Monday, the Pentagon said. A small group of fighters, who appeared to be focused on a nearby Iraqi base, struck the outpost with small-arms fire.It was not close enough to do any damage, said Col. Steve Warren, the United States spokesman in Iraq, adding that no Marines were wounded. The Marines returned fire, killing at least two Islamic State fighters, Colonel Warren said.The outpost had been kept a secret because the Pentagon wanted to give the Marines a chance to become fully operational and ready to fight, Colonel Warren said.In a conference call with reporters, Colonel Warren said the Marines were not combat forces because they were positioned at the outpost to provide force protection to American military advisers working alongside Iraqi troops.They wont kind of go off and conduct any type of mission on their own, he said, referring to the Marines. They dont really have that capability anyways. Theyre just providing coverage, right? Theyre providing fire support coverage for the several thousand Iraqi soldiers and the several hundred advisers.The Pentagon said that 100 to 200 Marines were at the outpost, and that they were from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit. They began moving into Iraq within the last couple of weeks, according to a statement from the public affairs office of Operation Inherent Resolve, the name of the American mission in Iraq.Critics of the administration contend that it does not want to say the forces in Iraq are in combat because it would run counter to President Obamas assertion that he ended combat missions there in 2010.A White House spokeswoman, Emily Horne, declined to comment, saying a statement from the administration in October about the matter still applies.That month, the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, said that it helps to differentiate between the train, advise and assist mission that our military personnel are currently undertaking from the long-term, sustained ground combat operations that U.S. military personnel were involved in starting in 2003 and going all the way up to 2010 or 2011.The Marine killed on Saturday in Iraq was Staff Sgt. Louis F. Cardin, 27, from Temecula, Calif.Two rockets were fired on the base during the attack, Colonel Warren said. One landed harmlessly, and the other one, unfortunately, did not, he said.The Marines returned fire, although it was not clear whether any enemy fighters were killed, Colonel Warren said. Several of the Marines who were wounded suffered scratches and returned to duty. Others were taken to a military hospital in Germany.Sergeant Cardin was the second American service member killed in Iraq since the United States began operations against the Islamic State in 2014.Mr. Obama acknowledged the episode on Monday during a news conference with President Ral Castro in Havana. I just wanted to give my thoughts and prayers to the family there and those who have been injured, Mr. Obama said. Its a reminder that even as we embark on this historic visit, there are U.S. armed service members who are sacrificing each and every day on behalf of our freedom and our safety. So Im grateful to them."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trump condemned the terrorist attacks in Belgium in television interviews on Tuesday, reiterating his call for a moratorium on foreign Muslim immigrants entering the United States, advocating expanding international laws to allow forms of torture and bluntly predicting, This is going to happen in the United States.On Fox News, Mr. Trump said, This is a story that seems to be more and more happening. He described Brussels, even before the attacks, as an armed camp, although he did not elaborate on what he was referring to and wasnt pressed.Without specifically saying he was referring to them, Mr. Trump intimated that Muslims are not assimilating in an interview on CBS News. And he faulted others in the community for not identifying, and reporting, prospective terrorists. In that same interview, Mr. Trump said he would be speaking again later in the day with his foreign policy advisers. But if they dont advise me to be very strong, and very tough, at the borders, then Im probably not a fan of that particular person.The CBS News anchors pressed Mr. Trump about whether he was calling for a form of racial profiling, as he repeatedly suggested the attackers have come from Muslim-heavy countries. Pointing to the shooters in the Paris terrorist attacks last fall, Mr. Trump said, They werent exactly from Sweden that did the shootings.On the Today show on NBC, Mr. Trump, who has been criticized for such statements in the past and has tried to clarify his views on torture before, said that he would favor methods such as waterboarding to extract information from suspects believed to be involved in attacks.If it was up to me and if we changed the laws and have the laws, waterboarding would be fine, Mr. Trump said. If they could expand the laws I would do a lot more than waterboarding. He questioned how some people photographed migrating from Syria to Europe were seen holding cellphones, and wondered who paid those bills.Theres no assimilation. They are not assimilating and they are not assimilating in other locations, either, Mr. Trump said. They want to go by Sharia law. They dont want laws that we have. They want Sharia law.  And you know you say to yourself, at what point how much of this do you take?Belgian officials have said little about who perpetrated the attacks and how many people were involved. But Mr. Trump, pushed by the Fox News anchors to question whether people who had ascribed racism to his proposed Muslim ban were wrong, called for tighter borders with regard to Muslim immigrants.You have to be very vigilant as to who you have and where youre coming from, Mr. Trump said, adding, The assimilation is very, very difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Muslims, he said, have to become part of the community.The twin attacks came several hours before two Republican nominating contests in the presidential race to succeed President Obama. Mr. Trumps calls for tighter borders helped propel him to the top of a divided and crowded Republican field over the last several months.Mr. Trump, on Fox News, said that things are not gonna change. Its not gonna get better.  His message to the United States, he said, is we better get smart and we better get smart fast. As president, he added, he would give a pep talk to rally spirit after such a dangerous moment."}
{"text": "Rick Nash did not whoop, because he never does, but he exhaled as his shoulders drooped in relief Monday after his first goal since Dec. 30. He had missed 20 games with a bone bruise and had yet to rediscover the net since his return.His 13th goal of the season could not have been more exquisitely timed. Nash pounded in a shot with 8 minutes 46 seconds left in the third period, just after a power play ended, and lifted the Rangers to a critical 4-2 victory over the Florida Panthers at Madison Square Garden.Anytime the puck goes in, you exhale, Nash said with a slight smile. Its nice to help the team by scoring, but Im just really concentrating on finding my game right now and finding some consistency.Two days after the Rangers were pelted with 52 shots in a loss to the San Jose Sharks that felt like garbage, as defenseman Marc Staal described it, they rebounded to post their 13th straight victory after a regulation loss, the longest such streak within one season in franchise history.The Rangers (41-24-8) passed the idle Pittsburgh Penguins (40-24-8) for second place in the Metropolitan Division, though the Rangers have played one more game. The Rangers will play Boston on Wednesday, and the Penguins will face the Devils on Thursday.Henrik Lundqvist made 13 of his 25 saves in the third period  and benefited when an apparent goal by defenseman Steven Kampfer was waved off because Kampfer was judged to have knocked in the puck with a high stick.It was great to see how we responded as a group after the last game, Lundqvist said. It also shows how much focus to details and determination can change the look out there. Going from last game to this game, its like two different teams.Nash was the hero simply because he had not scored since the Rangers 38th game. His goal, off a pass from defenseman Kevin Klein just after a high-sticking penalty on Jonathan Huberdeau had expired, increased the Rangers lead to 3-1.Ive been saying it since hes been back: We have to be patient, Coach Alain Vigneault said of Nash, who played his sixth game since returning to the lineup March 12. That injury kept him from doing anything as far as weight-bearing for close to six weeks. Hes probably not still fully recovered.The Panthers had closed the gap to 2-1 at 6:51 of the third period, when Vincent Trocheck charged toward Lundqvist and tipped in Jussi Jokinens sharp pass from the left wing. The Rangers were caught flat-footed in their zone, with Panthers forward Reilly Smith launching a fierce rush.With the backup Florida goaltender Al Montoya pulled for an extra attacker, Jiri Hudler scored a power-play goal with 36 seconds left to cut the Panthers deficit to 3-2.But Tanner Glass scored an empty-net goal with 8.2 seconds left to seal the victory.It helped that the Rangers pushed the puck into the Panthers zone early, compiling an 8-3 edge in shots on goal in the first period. The Rangers scored on their sixth shot, with the fourth-line forward Viktor Stalberg recording his ninth goal of the season and his first since Feb. 12.Stalberg poked the puck away from Jaromir Jagr, the Panthers 44-year-old forward, and steamed up the left wing, with center Dominic Moore joining him on a two-on-one rush. Stalberg slipped a pass to Moore under defenseman Aaron Ekblad. Moore fed the puck back to Stalberg, who flipped a backhand shot between Montoyas legs at 11:15.The Rangers, who are 29-5-4 when scoring first and 22-3-3 when leading after the first period, allowed one shot the rest of the period.He might not be as fast as he used to be, Stalberg said, referring to Jagr, but Ive got to step up.Mats Zuccarello, falling to the ice for the third time in a minute, gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead by taking a pass from Derick Brassard and flicking a shot from the high slot past Montoya at 3:33 of the second.But the Panthers (40-24-9) are in first place in the Atlantic Division with good reason. During one furious scramble late in the second, they did everything but score, knocking the puck along the goal line and off the post to Lundqvists left.The referee T. J. Luxmore added some drama to the play by jumping to avoid Jokinens rebound attempt and then landing next to Lundqvist, nearly clipping his blocker.Maybe next time hell stay outside the post, said Lundqvist, who was in a good mood for a change."}

Combine a superiors order with vilifying the other in the midst of real or perceived danger, and almost anyone will torture.Americas core values and security demand that we choose leaders who have the wisdom and courage not to torture.

Because we were soldiers, ours was a job we could not quit, but we would have refused anyway and faced the consequences.My compassion for a hired torturer who was free to leave at any time can go only so far.PETER G.

{"text": "A 14-year-old boy took an unloaded gun in his backpack to a Brooklyn middle school on Tuesday, the third time in a week that a student has been caught with a firearm on a New York City school campus, the authorities said.Officers seized the gun and two partially loaded magazines from the boy around 12:50 p.m. at the Dr. Gladstone H. Atwell Middle School on the border of the Crown Heights and Prospect-Lefferts Gardens neighborhoods, the police said. He was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the second and fourth degrees, criminal possession of a weapon on school grounds and unlawful possession of a weapon on school grounds.An administrator had pulled the boy aside for questioning, and in the presence of a second administrator and a school safety agent, the boy admitted to having the gun, telling them he had been fighting with a group of people near the school who were not students, the police said. It was unclear why he had been questioned and where he got the gun.The gun, a 9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun, was unloaded, but the magazines contained a total of nine rounds, the police said.Toya Holness, an Education Department spokeswoman, called the episode profoundly disturbing and said school officials were aiding the police.The school, which the department said has about 800 students in sixth through eighth grades, is across the street from the 71st Precinct station house."}

{"text": "Police officials said on Tuesday that they would increase enforcement around 20 bars and clubs in New York City with a disproportionate share of the stabbings and slashings that have resulted in a surge in knife violence this year.Under the new strategy, known as Operation Cutting Edge, the police are focusing on the places where knife violence primarily occurs: behind the walls of nightclubs  legal and illegal  during the late-night and early-morning hours on weekends, and at the homes of those known to have domestic troubles.More and more attention will be put there, Mayor Bill de Blasio said, announcing the policy at a news conference at 1 Police Plaza in Manhattan. Im convinced the N.Y.P.D. is constantly looking for ways to get at problems more effectively, and Im going to make sure that they have the resources they need to do so.Nearly 900 knife crimes have been recorded since Jan. 1, an increase of about 22 percent from the same period last year, William J. Bratton, the police commissioner, said. A small portion have occurred in the citys subway system and homeless shelters  about 2 to 3 percent, in each case, officials said. As the attacks in those places have attracted outsize attention, the de Blasio administration has increased the police presence underground and retrained some guards in city shelters.Officers have been gathering granular details about each knife attack and feeding the data into the Police Departments system for analyzing crimes, said James P. ONeill, the chief of department. They no longer classify knife attacks broadly as felony assaults, as they had for decades, but rather are documenting the specific types of knife attacks, the weapons used, and the methods, means and motives behind the attacks.The analysis so far has shown that 60 percent of all slashings and stabbings occurred indoors, Chief ONeill said, and that 23 of them were random. About one-fifth of all cases occurred between 7 p.m. and 4 a.m. on Fridays and Saturdays, he said. And 277 cases, or about 30 percent of all instances of knife violence this year, were considered domestic related, he said. Nearly a quarter of all knife crimes this year have occurred around the 20 bars and clubs on which the department is focusing. Officials did not name the clubs.The department is sending officers on patrols around these clubs and others, both licensed and unlicensed, some of which were operating illegally after hours.Its important to have that uniformed presence, specifically at the places that we have identified as the most problematic, Chief ONeill said.Officers will make more visits to the homes of those with pending domestic violence cases. The departments legal bureau will work to identify persistent violators. Officers will also visit stores that sell box cutters to remind proprietors of the law (and will be given reminders themselves): The tools must be locked behind the counter and sold only to those 21 or over.Mr. Bratton said the efforts hark back to lessons from the mid-1990s, when the police began tracking shootings with clinical specificity.Today, investigators work to log the motives for gun violence and to use ballistics checks and gun-tracing methods to connect crimes or establish patterns. These efforts have allowed a significant number of shootings to be linked to people involved in gangs or crews or in the narcotics trade. Last year, a new unit in the Intelligence Division took nearly 1,000 guns off the streets by developing detailed cases and obtaining search warrants, officials have said, and the mayor noted at the news conference that both killings and shootings have continued to decline.But the problems involved with policing knife crimes were much more diverse than with gun crimes, Mr. Bratton said, because knives were more pervasive.Knives are a constant in our lives, he said. Theyre everywhere.With the new strategies, and with 1,700 new officers set to graduate to the streets by July, Mr. Bratton said he expected the city to see the number of knife crimes go down in the weeks ahead."}
{"text": "What does it take to live a good life?Surveys show that most young adults believe that obtaining wealth and fame are keys to a happy life. But a long-running study out of Harvard suggests that one of the most important predictors of whether you age well and live a long and happy life is not the amount of money you amass or notoriety you receive. A much more important barometer of long term health and well-being is the strength of your relationships with family, friends and spouses.These are some of the findings from the Harvard Study of Adult Development, a research project that since 1938 has closely tracked and examined the lives of more than 700 men and in some cases their spouses. The study has revealed some surprising  andsome not so surprising  factors that determine whether people are likely to age happily and healthily, or descend into loneliness, sickness and mental decline.The studys current director, Robert Waldinger, outlined some of the more striking findings from the long-running project in a recent TED Talk that has garnered more than seven million views.We publish our findings in academic journals that most people dont read, said Dr. Waldinger, a clinical professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. And so we really wanted people to know that this study exists and that it has for 75 years. Weve been funded by the government for so many years, and its important that more people know about this besides academics.The study began in Boston in the 1930s with two very different groups of young men.In one case, a team of researchers decided to track Harvard college students through adulthood to see what factors played important roles in their growth and success. They thought there was too much emphasis placed on pathology at the time and that it would be really useful to study people who were doing well in their young adult development, Dr. Waldinger said. The study recruited 268 Harvard sophomores and followed them closely, with frequent interviews and health examinations. In recent years the study has also incorporated brain scans, blood draws and interviews with the subjects spouses and adult children.At around the same time the study began, a Harvard Law School professor named Sheldon Glueck started to study young men from some of Bostons poorest neighborhoods, including 456 who managed to avoid delinquency despite coming from troubled homes. Eventually the two groups were merged into one study.Over the decades, the men have gone into all walks of life. Theyve become lawyers, doctors, businessmen and  in the case of one Harvard student named John F. Kennedy  president of the United States. Others went down different paths. Some became alcoholics, had disappointingcareers or descended into mental illness. Those who remain alive today are in their 90s.Through the years, the study has produced many notable findings. It showed, for example, that to age well physically, the single most important thing you could do was to avoid smoking. It discovered that aging liberals had longer and more active sex lives than conservatives. It found that alcohol was the primary cause of divorce among men in the study, and that alcohol abuse often preceded depression (rather than the other way around).The study has gone through several directors. Dr. Waldinger, who took over in 2003, is its fourth. He expanded the study so it focused not just on the men but also on their wives and children. The researchers began videotaping the couples in their homes, studying their interactions, and interviewing them separately about nearly every facet of their lives, even day-to-day spats.As the researchers looked at the factors throughout the years that strongly influenced health and well-being, they found that relationships with friends, and especially spouses, were a major one. The people in the strongest relationships were protected against chronic disease, mental illness and memory decline  even if those relationships had many ups and downs.Those good relationships dont have to be smooth all the time, Dr. Waldinger said. Some of our octogenarian couples could bicker day in and day out. But as long as they felt that they could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didnt take a toll on their memories.Dr. Waldinger found a similar pattern among relationships outside the home. The people who sought to replace old colleagues with new friends after retiring were happier and healthier than those who left work and placed less emphasis on maintaining strong social networks.Over and over in these 75 years, Dr. Waldinger said, our study has shown that the people who fared the best were the people who leaned into relationships with family, with friends and with community.Dr. Waldinger acknowledged that the research showed a correlation, not necessarily causation. Another possibility is that people who are healthier and happier to begin with are simply more likelyto make and maintain relationships, whereas thosewho are sicker gradually become more socially isolated or end up in bad relationships.But he said that by following the subjects for many decades and comparing the state of their health and their relationships early on, he was fairly confident that strong social bonds area causal role in long-term health and well-being.So what concrete actions does he recommend?The possibilities are endless, he said. Something as simple as replacing screen time with people time, or livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together, long walks or date nights. Reach out to that family member you havent spoken to in years  because those all-too-common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges."}

{"text": "The game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban national team in Havana on Tuesday was a television spectacle, presented by ESPN as a game entwined in international politics. The visuals were clear from the frequent cuts between the on-field action and President Obama and President Ral Castro, who were sitting together at Estadio Latinoamericano. Economic policy was laid out in Obamas remarks about how business from America will help give the United States leverage in Cuba.Obama got even more of a star turn in Havana than he gets when he fills out his mens and womens N.C.A.A. tournament brackets on ESPN. Of course, there is no political agenda to bracketology unless youre talking about Duke and North Carolina. You saw him cheering, standing, gesticulating, turning occasionally to the first lady, Michelle Obama, who, it turns out, objected to some umpires calls, and chatting with Castro. When the Rays went ahead, 1-0, he tapped Castro on the shoulder  could Obama have been gloating?  a gesture the dictator returned with a handshake.The president even offered Castros opinion about the pace of baseball. He was saying baseball is too long, he told ESPNs announcers, but he thoughtfully noted (with Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred sitting behind him) that actions have been taken to speed up games.Obama was ESPNs star of the day, overshadowing Castro, his host, and James Loney, who drove in three Tampa Bay runs in a 4-1 victory over the Cubans. Obama gave a lengthy interview to ESPNs announcers. He schmoozed frequently, with ESPNs cameras on him, as if he were working a rope line, greeting the likes of Derek Jeter (the frequency of their contact suggested a blooming bromance), Dave Winfield and Rachel Robinson. About the only thing Obama did not do was put on a headset in the Rays dugout and talk remotely to the ESPN crew about the infield shift, as managers frequently do between innings of the networks baseball games.There was a special poignancy to Rachel Robinsons presence in Cuba. Her husband, Jackie, played in the same stadium in 1947 for the Montreal Royals, before breaking the color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers soon after. Robinsons act of courage was a precursor to the civil rights movement of the 1950s; the civil rights movement made it possible for Obama to become the first African-American president. Thats the power of baseball, he said. He talked about how fans rooting for a black man taught Americans that skills and character matter, not skin color.But he told ESPNs announcers that baseball still had much work to do, in hiring more black and Latino managers and finding more minority owners.One of ESPNs announcers, Eduardo Perez, played a special role. His father, Tony, left Cuba and became a baseball Hall of Famer, playing mainly for the Cincinnati Reds. On this trip, he visited relatives in Cuba who had stayed behind and showed video of his reunion with them when Tony Perez joined the broadcast by telephone. Perez did not impose his family connection on the broadcast and asked Obama one question about what he would tell Cubans about their future as the United States and Cuba try to transform their once-frozen relationship.But the younger Perez did object to the sight of Luis Tiant, the Cuban-born major league star who threw out the first pitch and shook hands with Castro. I dont know if I would have done that, he said. Perez did not elaborate, other than to say he would reflect on that moment when he arrived home in Miami.But an ESPN colleague, Dan Le Batard, a first-generation Cuban-American, wrote an essay earlier this week that was far blunter than Perezs comments. Le Batard examined the pain of his parents and the country that was lost to them. His father, Gonzalo, is part of Le Batards show, Highly Questionable.Separate from the improving relations between the United States and Cuba is the reality of Le Batards parents past  an ocean, he writes, filled with the Cuban bodies that tell the story, lives literally thrown to the wind in desperation, hoping to reach Americas possibility-soaked shores on boats made of old tires and wood and povertys debris. No free press. No elections. No freedom. Thats the Cuba that still surrounds the baseball diamond where we play this game. He also writes: And now, my parents, old exiles, have to watch Obama and Jeter and ESPN throw a happy party on land that was stolen from my family  as the rest of America celebrates it, no less.But Le Batards fury was not intrinsic to the game broadcast. The festive and hopeful flavor of the broadcast was reflected more by Rays pitcher Chris Archer. He not only passed one of starter Matt Moores gloves to Obama as a gift and joked with the Obamas that they had ignored his posts on Twitter inviting them to go out for Cuban cuisine or a coffee, but he also offered comments to ESPNs Tim Kurkjian that gibed with the goals of Obama and M.L.B in the Cuba rapprochement. Im hoping that were laying the foundation for something special going forward, he said. Obviously we have differences as countries, differences in opinions about human rights, but hopefully we can find some common ground."}

{"text": "Bob Adelman, a freelance photographer whose vivid images of unspeakable brutality and despair brought segregation and the civil rights movement home to Americans in the 1960s, died on Saturday in Miami Beach. He was 85.The police said that Mr. Adelman had head injuries that appeared to be consistent with a fall. The medical examiners office said on Wednesday that the cause of death was hypertensive and atherosclerotic heart disease.In 1963, Mr. Adelmans access as a volunteer photographer for civil rights organizations enabled him to capture dramatic close-ups of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivering his I Have a Dream speech at the Lincoln Memorial.Among his other poignant portraits was that of the Rev. Joseph Carter standing sentinel on his front porch holding a rifle against a possible Ku Klux Klan ambush after he became the first black resident of West Feliciana Parish, La., to register to vote in six decades.In another picture, four protesters were silhouetted against a spray of water as they held hands to keep from being felled by fire hoses in Birmingham, Ala.I managed to shoot several rolls with a Nikon F and a telephoto lens, even though I was appalled, frightened and very upset, Mr. Adelman (the first syllable rhymes with saddle) told The Guardian in 2008. He added, Afterwards I went up to Doc  which is what we called Dr. King  and gave him a print of the picture. He said he was startled that beauty could come out of so much pain.Mr. Adelmans photographs of sit-ins and demonstrations appeared in national publications like Time, Life and The New York Times Magazine. They were reproduced to recruit volunteers and raise funds, entered into evidence in court cases, archived in the Library of Congress and published in his 2007 book, Mine Eyes Have Seen: Bearing Witness to the Struggle for Civil Rights.I realized that my involvement would be very dangerous, but I had a long think with myself and decided that this was something worth risking your life for, Mr. Adelman told The New York Times in 2014.I shot with one eye on the lens, one eye on history, and my heart was with the movement, he said in an interview with Black & White magazine.Robert Melvin Adelman was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 30, 1930, the son of Eastern European immigrants. His father, Samuel, an amateur photographer, was a craftsman who helped install the floors when President Harry S. Truman renovated the White House. His mother was the former Anna Pomerantz.Raised in Far Rockaway, Queens, Mr. Adelman graduated from Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan (as a student he had sneaked into the Birdland nightclub to photograph black entertainers), earned a bachelors degree in 1951 from Rutgers University (where his thesis was on the slave trade), studied at Harvard Law School and received a masters in philosophy from Columbia University.His marriage to the former Trudy Viner ended in divorce. They had one daughter, Samantha Joy Reay, who survives him, along with a sister, Dolores Feldman, and three grandchildren.Mr. Adelman studied with Alexey Brodovitch, the renowned art director of Harpers Bazaar, and was a protg of Jacques Lowe, the official photographer to President John F. Kennedy.Photographing jazz musicians first, he expanded into socially relevant subjects like pickets outside white-owned stores in Harlem and sit-ins staged by young students in the South. He volunteered to document the protests for the Congress of Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.In New York, he forged friendships with Andy Warhol (he photographed Warhol shopping for Campbells soup in a Gristedes supermarket in New York) and the artist Roy Lichtenstein.But Mr. Adelman, who moved to Florida about two decades ago, never wavered in his commitment to document racial discrimination and remedy it.Race is still a very difficult topic in American life, he said in an interview with NPR in 2008, because its Americas original sin and something we all must do whatever we can to rectify.He told Jet magazine in 2014: In a profound sense, the movement revealed how segregation was ugly and un-American. The photographs were the evidence."}

Mr. Trump defended himself in part by invoking the citys response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz garnered raucous cheers for a stump speech peppered with allusions to New York politics, including debates over fracking and charter schools.The people of New York understand firsthand the liberal, left-wing values of New York politicians, he told reporters. The people of New York have suffered under the liberal, left-wing values of New York politicians.He rifled through a laundry list of local Democrats, disparaging Anthony D. Weiner, Eliot Spitzer, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Representative Charlie B. Rangel.Mr. Cruz reserved his most pointed criticism for Mr. de Blasio. On Tuesday, the mayor and his police commissioner, William J. Bratton, sharply criticized Mr. Cruz for his calls to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods in the wake of the terror attacks in Brussels. Mr. de Blasio called the remarks reprehensible and accused Mr. Cruz of demagogy.On Wednesday, Mr. Cruz by turns depicted Mr. de Blasio as a shill for the teachers union and an enemy of police officers, describing a 2014 police protest against the mayor after the shooting deaths of two officers.When the heroes of the N.Y.P.D. stood up and turned their backs on Mayor de Blasio, they spoke not just for the men and women of New York but for Americans all across this nation, Mr. Cruz said, to cheers.Mr. Cruz is considered an underdog in the New York primary on April 19, given Mr. Trumps local ties and the perception that a message of conservative purity might not resonate with more moderate voters.Yet in the crowd, there were signs of his potential strength, including several voters who cheered his New York values remarks.He understands New York politics, said John Cudney, 33, from the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.And even in his neighborhood, Mr. Cudney said, the tide seemed to be turning for conservatives, if only slightly.Its getting gentrified, he said, gesturing toward his smart purple button-down. There are more people who dress like me there."}
{"text": "BEIJING  If President Obama was looking for encouragement after his meeting with President Ral Castro of Cuba in Havana, the Chinese news media was not the place to find it.Rapprochement with Cuba requires renunciation of U.S. arrogance, blared a headline in Xinhua, the state news agency.Long road ahead for U.S.-Cuba ties after visit, said the lead editorial on Tuesday in China Daily, a state-run English-language newspaper.Beijing has long had a special bond with Havana, even though Cuba is only a sliver of Chinas size and sits half a world away. China and Cuba are two of the few remaining Communist nations in the world, and in recent years Beijing has become one of Havanas leading trading partners.In response to Mr. Obamas promise of a new day of openness between Cuba and the United States on Monday, several Chinese commentators, officials and foreign policy experts expressed caution. Others praised Mr. Obamas decision to bring an end to nearly six decades of tensions. Here is a sampling of the reaction:Warnings of American hegemony: Chinese officials have long derided the imperialist tendencies of the United States. In recent years, they have invoked that term to describe Washingtons relationship with Latin America.Global Times, a nationalistic Chinese publication, warned on Monday that political cliques in the United States that were seeking to overthrow the Cuban government still existed. If the White House turns a blind eye to or even submits to them, it said, Obamas legacy will be abandoned by his successor.A call for ending the embargo: For years, China has pushed the United States to end its trade embargo of Cuba, saying it is cruel to the Cuban people. Beijing used the occasion of Mr. Obamas trip to Havana to reiterate its position, saying it was a crucial way to stimulate the long-dormant Cuban economy. It is hoped that the two sides would build on this good momentum, said Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.A Xinhua editorial on Monday was more direct. Obama has been dragging his feet in lifting the decades-old embargo against Cuba, which has taken its toll on the islands economy and the Cuban peoples livelihood, it said, calling for the United States to offer compensation to Cuba to pay for past wrongdoings.Reassurances about the China-Cuba bond: Chinese scholars and officials dismissed suggestions that a closer relationship between Cuba and the United States would hurt China. Cubas economy will develop, and thats also beneficial to China, said Su Hao, a professor at China Foreign Affairs University.Ms. Hua said that better relations were a win-win, and that China would deepen its relations with Cuba.Chinese leaders have flocked to Cuba in recent years as China has sought to extend its influence in Latin America. President Xi Jinping visited in 2014, paying tribute to the barracks where Fidel Castro started his revolution in 1953. Mr. Xi even took time to sip a mojito, Cubas signature drink."}
{"text": "An urbane, soft-spoken former auto executive, Aldo Bozzi does not fit the mold of a driven Manhattan restaurateur  much less one who almost single-handedly, if inadvertently, set off a restaurant revolution in the United States and beyond.And Mezzaluna, his colorful and cacophonous little trattoria on the Upper East Side, hardly seems the setting for any kind of upheaval. Yet in a fresh and unassuming way, it introduced a style of modern Italian dining that still informs restaurants today, from Mario Batalis new La Sirena in Manhattan to the much lauded Poggio Trattoria in Sausalito, Calif.I never imagined I would be doing this, and 30 years later, Mr. Bozzi, 75, said recently over lunch at Mezzaluna. When I started, I simply wanted to have a place that served the kind of food I was accustomed to growing up in Italy.That kind of food was found in classic trattorias, which are ubiquitous today. But in 1984, when Mezzaluna opened, they were all but unknown in this country.When I first visited Mezzaluna, I felt so excited that New York at last had a genuine Milanese trattoria, said Danny Meyer, the president of Union Square Hospitality Group and a crusader for authentic Italian cooking at Maialino, Marta and other restaurants. This was a year before Mr. Meyer started his company with the debut of Union Square Cafe. The success of Mezzaluna reinforced my confidence in the direction we were heading.Back then, most Italian restaurants in Manhattan came in two flavors: old-style red sauce spots, and fancy Frenchified salons sporting tuxedoed captains, leather banquettes, elegant flatware and menus the size of a small-town phone book. Il Monello, Il Nido, Tre Scalini, Barbetta  all are gone except Barbetta.The cooking at many of these high-end dining rooms focused largely on the classics, embracing gastronomic barbells like bchamel-bound lasagna, fettuccine Alfredo and spaghetti alla carbonara in bounteous portions.A traditional trattoria, on the other hand, is small, family-run, assiduously local, inexpensive and features exceptional ingredients served by authentic Italian people not wearing tuxedos. Attempting to define todays urban iteration is like trying to describe the average automobile: It can be sleek, stylish and fast; modest, dependable and leisurely; or even homey.Several reputable restaurateurs took a stab at the trattoria format in the early days: at Trattoria da Alfredo, Nanni and, most notably, the celebrity clubhouse Da Silvano, which opened in 1975 and still thrives. But none rallied a culinary uprising the way Mezzaluna did.Aldo succeeded because he saw that there was a fundamental transformation going on in our society at the time, said Piero Selvaggio, owner of the luxurious Valentino restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. Mr. Selvaggio pointed to the new wave of Italian immigrants in the early 1980s.They were better educated, he said. They had a different lifestyle, different tastes, and Mezzaluna captured that. (In 1985, Mr. Selvaggio opened a trattoria called Primi, in Santa Monica, which he sold in 2001.)With a degree from one of Milans elite business schools, Mr. Bozzi joined the Alfa Romeo company in 1965. Three years later, he was dispatched to New York, where he rose to president of North American operations. During this time, he traveled the country extensively. Being a worldly epicure, he spent much time seeking out authentic Italian restaurants, a challenge akin to finding Alpine skiing in Delaware.They called everything northern Italian or southern Italian, which meant white or red, he said.In 1980, Mr. Bozzi was summoned back to the home office in Milan, a move that, if nothing else, represented a lucrative gastronomic promotion. But I never really wanted to be in the car business, he said. So I didnt go.During a two-year stint running a Manhattan-based Italian gold company, he nurtured a crazy notion that had been building for almost a decade: Why not open a restaurant?Using part of his $250,000 severance from Alfa Romeo, he assumed a lease on a 1,100-square-foot storefront on Third Avenue. With little experience but much grit, he went to work channeling the spirit of his two favorite trattorias in Milan: the fashionable Ristorante la Briciola and Paper Moon. Thus arrived a four-seat antique wood bar; elbow-to-elbow marble tables (It creates a party atmosphere every night); special terra-cotta floor tiles from Florence; and a muraled ceiling of a cerulean sky and puffy white clouds.The cynosure of the room, however, was the artwork. Mr. Bozzi commissioned a renowned Florentine architect, Roberto Magris, who enlisted dozens of artists to interpret the restaurants logo: a crescent-shaped, two-handed chopping tool called a mezzaluna. The result is a captivating collage of framed images  some whimsical, some alluringly enigmatic. In one corner, behind the bar, is a wood-fired pizza oven in the shape of a beehive, perhaps the first of its kind in the city.Mr. Bozzi laughed as he recalled the day the fire department conducted its preopening inspection. They didnt know what to make of it, he said. So they wrote on the report: fireplace.Along with his chef (and now partner), Paolo Casagranda, Mr. Bozzi built a menu around innovative pizzas, 17 in all. While they may not seem so groundbreaking today, in 1985 many were eye-opening: speck smoked with juniper or pine wood, imported broccoli rabe marinated in garlic vinegar, burrata, wild mushrooms. Many of the pastas were made with imported gragnano, a handmade dried pasta from Naples.Portions were modest, to encourage a variety of tastings. Among other firsts, Mezzaluna placed cruets of excellent olive oil on dining tables, from his small family estate outside Florence. There were no main courses, only carpacci; bright, composed salads with seafood and meats cooked in the wood oven; pastas with roasted vegetables; shellfish; and one dessert, tiramis. (The current menu is larger.)This was the forerunner of lighter and smaller plates, said Nick Valenti, the chief executive of the hospitality company Patina Restaurant Group, who was so impressed by Mezzaluna that he enlisted Mr. Bozzi as a consultant, an arrangement that continues.A savvy oenophile, Mr. Bozzi was dismayed by the poor quality of house wines in most American restaurants. With Mr. Casagrandas input, he mounted a blackboard and presented six whites and six reds by the glass from quality producers like Gaja, Antinori and Mastroberardino.Mezzaluna opened in June 1984. In characteristic New York fashion, the moment the news media ebulliently broadcast its arrival, a Pamplona scene ensued. Its 45 neighborly tables turned more than 10 times a day, while the overtaxed pizza oven devoured more wood than a paper plant in Maine.In 1987, Mr. Bozzi and a partner opened a larger trattoria, Mezzogiorno, in SoHo. It quickly became a haunt of the downtown art world. The art dealer Leo Castelli dined there seven days a week. (Mezzogiorno closed last fall, owing to a lease issue, and reopened on the Upper West Side.)The outward trek of the American trattoria gained traction in 1988, when three Mezzaluna employees fashioned a snazzy replica, just a calzones toss up Third Avenue, called Ciao Bella. Several years later, they opened Bella Blu, on Lexington Avenue, followed by others. By then, numerous trattorias of all stripes were sprouting in Manhattan with names like Le Madri, CentAnni, Coco Pazzo, Serafina and Mediterraneo.Riding on the prevailing culinary winds, trattoria spores drifted far and wide. Mr. Bozzi dabbled in licensing the Mezzaluna brand in Aspen, Colo.; Beverly Hills, Calif.; and the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles  the scene of Nicole Brown Simpsons last meal. (The latter two have closed, and Mr. Bozzi is no longer involved in the Aspen restaurant.) His biggest licensing success, and the most unlikely, has been in Turkey, where a dozen Mezzalunas are slicing up carpacci.Today, the Manhattan original thrives as a low-key favorite of chefs like Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Daniel Boulud, Thomas Keller and Bobby Flay.When Mr. Bozzi is not overseeing Mezzaluna with Mr. Casagranda, or conceiving Italian projects for Patina Restaurant Group, he spends more than a third of the year in Italy with his wife, Chiara, a retired pediatrician.At the conclusion of a long interview over tiramis and espresso, one critical question remained for this improbable pioneer: Do you drive an Alfa Romeo?I am not driving one at present, Mr. Bozzi said, pausing for the punch line. But in two weeks I will have a new nephew. His name is Romeo."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   An American airstrike on Tuesday killed dozens of fighters at a mountainous training camp used by the Yemeni affiliate of Al Qaeda, Pentagon officials said, the latest sign that the military is hastening its strikes against militants in the Middle East and Africa.The attack followed an airstrike this month on a training camp in Somalia that killed about 150 militants from the Islamist group the Shabab. They were believed to have assembled for a graduation ceremony.In the Yemen strike, officials said more than 70 fighters from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, as the affiliate is known, had been using the camp.We continue to assess the results of the operation, but our initial assessment is that dozens of A.Q.A.P. fighters have been removed from the battlefield, Peter Cook, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement. This strike deals a blow to A.Q.A.P.s ability to use Yemen as a base for attacks that threaten U.S. persons, and it demonstrates our commitment to defeating Al Qaeda and denying it safe haven.The strike occurred in the midst of a Saudi-led military campaign against Houthi rebels, who have received some backing from Iran. The United States has supported the Saudi campaign with intelligence assistance, midair refueling and other logistical support. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has exploited the conflict by taking over significant parts of southern Yemen.American counterterrorism officials have said that while the Islamic State poses a threat to the United States, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is probably more capable of carrying out a complex terrorist attack, like bringing down an airliner.The United States has struck the group many times in recent years. In 2011, Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric who had become a Qaeda leader in Yemen, was killed in an airstrike there."}

{"text": "Theres a risk here  or a collection of risks  but the magnitude of the risk depends on what infectious diseases are circulating in your community. And that, in turn, may depend on how common it is for people in your area to make the choice that your friend is making.But your 8-month-old is not yet fully protected against some diseases that are particularly dangerous  and can even be deadly  in children that young.We start giving flu shots at 6 months; a baby needs two doses, one month apart, so your baby should be protected against flu, and an 8-month-old child should also have finished the series of vaccines against rotavirus, which causes diarrhea. Thats important here, because both flu and rotavirus are certainly still in circulation and could well turn up in children who have not been immunized  both diseases are highly contagious and can be very serious in infants.Your 8-month-old will also have started the series of immunizations which will result in protection against several of the infectious diseases that still turn up regularly in the United States, including pertussis (whooping cough) and two bacteria, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B, which can cause a range of infections, from ear infections to pneumonia to meningitis. So there may be partial protection, but your baby still needs more doses.Your baby wont have any immunity against  measles and mumps or chickenpox, and there have been multiple outbreaks of all three in the United States in recent years. (The vaccines for those are recommended between 12 and 15 months.) If those are circulating in your community  which is more likely if there are a lot of vaccine refusers  your childs playmates are at high risk, and that risk carries over to your child.  A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that large numbers of those who developed measles and pertussis during outbreaks were people who had refused vaccination.Its also important to remember that no vaccine offers 100 percent protection; immunizing one child helps protect that child, but immunizing all children creates a much safer environment, through herd immunity, so that even children with incomplete immunity face reduced risk of exposure.Here's someone who's making a choice not just for their child but for your child, said Dr. Paul A. Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. He added that as more people within a community choose not to immunize, the risk of outbreaks in that population rises. At the state level or city level or community level, where more people have chosen to exempt for nonmedical reasons, there's greater outbreaks of the diseases that are the most contagious.Do you have a health question?\n\t\t Submit your question to Ask Well.For more fitness, food and wellness news, follow us on Facebook and Twitter, or sign up for our newsletter."}
{"text": "The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation will give $4.8 million to the South Street Seaport Museum, which is recovering from severe damage incurred four years ago when Hurricane Sandy flooded streets around the seaport, according to state and museum officials. That damage came as the museum was just beginning to emerge from a decade of economic difficulties.The grant is part of a package of that Governor Andrew M. Cuomo announced in recent days that will use $50 million from the development corps legal settlement with a construction company. The money will be used to finance 14 cultural, recreational and educational projects, including a new complex in TriBeCa for the Flea Theater, improvements to a Lower East Side community center run by University Settlement and the Chinatown Y.M.C.A., and several initiatives meant to increase public access to the Hudson and East River waterfronts.Jonathan Boulware, executive director of the seaport museum, said it would use the money to pay for improvements, including an elevator and new electrical, lighting, fire safety and security systems, to its five-story Thompson warehouse on Water Street and three adjoining storefronts that it owns. The grant will also go toward a new 11,000-square-foot educational community center on the warehouses upper floors.The L.M.D.C. funding is absolutely critical, Mr. Boulware said by telephone. The museum is vital to New York but has been hit very, very hard by 9-11, by the recession, by Sandy.The 2015 legal settlement stemmed from a lawsuit between the development corp and the construction company, Lend Lease Construction LMB, over costs connected to the demolition of the Deutsche Bank Tower, which was badly damaged in the attacks of September, 11, 2001. That project, which was plagued by delays, political disputes and a fire in 2007 that killed two firefighters, became one of the countrys most expensive and long-running demolitions.Earlier this month the South Street Seaport Museum opened its first exhibition since 2012. That show, Street of Ships: The Port and Its People, includes art and artifacts from the museums permanent collections related to the 19th-century history of the Port of New York, once the worlds busiest shipping hub."}
{"text": "Surely this is the first opera production to include 100 sheep among its performers. Heiner Goebbelss staging of Louis Andriessens De Materie, which originated in 2014 in Germany, arrived in the vast Drill Hall of the Park Avenue Armory on Tuesday, with dozens of sheep from the Pennsylvania countryside in its cast.If using live farm animals sounds gimmicky, it was actually a charming, even profound aspect to an audaciously imaginative production. Completed by Mr. Andriessen, the Dutch Modernist master, in 1988 and first staged the next year, De Materie (Matter) resists categorization. Its a philosophical opera in four scenes; an anti-symphonic ultra-symphony; a theatrical spectacle; a piece blithely combining text, dance and singing; or all of the above.When Lincoln Center presented a concert performance of De Materie at Alice Tully Hall in 2004, I found Mr. Andriessens eclectic, nearly two-hour score riveting. It deftly combines seemingly incongruous elements: brassy Modernist tweaks on big-band jazz; choral writing that hints at both Renaissance modal styles and the Swingle Singers; undulant riffs of the Steve Reich sort; and passing evocations of everything from Bach to boogie-woogie. But thematically, De Materie seemed frustratingly vague, no less than an exploration of the relationship between matter and spirit, using texts ranging from the 16th-century Dutch declaration of independence from Spain to excerpts from Marie Curies diaries.But Mr. Goebbelss inspired production brings out the philosophical resonances that run through the work and revels in its literary crosscurrents. And this performance  featuring two fine solo singers; the impressive eight-member Chorwerk Ruhr; a roster of dancers; and the brilliant International Contemporary Ensemble, expanded with extra players  was colorful, exciting and, during reflective episodes, raptly beautiful. Peter Rundel was the assured conductor.Opera fans and theater audiences have had some experience with works that eschew linear narratives, like Einstein on the Beach. But compositions that also involve overlapping texts and themes, like De Materie, are rarer and often discombobulating. This piece opens with a bang, 144 of them to be exact: endless iterations of a pummeling chord in the orchestra, which this score weights heavily with brass, winds, percussion and synthesizers.The chords begin at a steady pace but soon grow nervous and speed up. The ensemble finally erupts into gnashing agitation. Then the choir of eight men and women (here costumed as if out of Dutch old master paintings) sing a setting of the document of Dutch independence, rendered in block declamatory chords. This segues into a similarly chordal setting of detailed Dutch shipbuilding instructions from the 17th century. Soon a solo tenor (Pascal Charbonneau) portraying Gorlaeus, a pioneering atomic theorist who died in 1612, sings urgent, clarion phrases explaining that matter consists of infinitesimally small particles.Mr. Goebbelss stage in this first part is dominated by big white tents, under which we eventually see the shadows of workers building the parts of a ship. The music explodes at one point with sounds of hammers, like a hammering fugue. The thematic meaning comes through vividly, as staged and performed here: The parts of the ship are fused into an entity, just as atomic particles make up all matter.Part 2, the slow movement of this operatic symphony, features a soprano (Evgeniya Sotnikova) singing with warmth and tenderness as Hadewijch, a 13th-century Dutch mystic nun and poet. In ravishing music, thick with shimmering orchestral harmonies, calmly oscillating figures and long, expansive vocal phrases, she sings of an ecstatic vision of Christ. In the intensity of her craving to know and taste him, Hadewijch imagines a connection more profound than normal human attachments. The synthesis she seeks is almost akin to atomic particle bonding.The Dutch painter Piet Mondrian is the subject of Part 3, which could be the scherzo of De Materie. Its simple, ingenious scenic element involves illuminated circles that change colors, dangling from three-piece metal bars that bend and move and even seem to dance, suggesting Mondrians geometric images. The chorus sings texts by the Dutch mathematician M. H. J. Schoenmaekers about the purity of a straight line. The music becomes alive with jazzy intensity and bursts of boogie-woogie, though filtered through hard-edged Modernist harmonies, as a roster of dancers led by two men take over the stage.Our sheep friends arrive in Part 4, as the chorus sings phrases from dreamy sonnets by the Dutch poet Willem Kloos. At first, the orchestral music unfolds with alternating chords, bright yet ominous, packed with pitches, yet somehow lucid. On Tuesday the sheep, almost as if directed to do so, moved slowly, huddling and hovering in a circle, like particles spinning within an atom. And their occasional bleating lent a lovely natural touch to the score.A final scene has Curie (here Catherine Milliken, a dancer), appearing before a gathering of scientist colleagues, speaking excerpts from her Nobel Prize acceptance speech, alternated with passages from her diary that pay tribute to her dead husband. Though affecting, the scene seemed too realistic in the context of such an experimental work.Thats a small reservation. The Park Avenue Armory, once again taking advantage of its awesome space, is offering a powerful performance of Mr. Andriessens arresting piece, however you want to classify it."}
{"text": "When the news broke that the decorated pastry chef and cookbook author Mindy Segal had partnered with Illinoiss largest medicinal marijuana grower, eyebrows were raised  and not because the outspoken Chicago iconoclast would be out of place making pot pastries. Rather, the thought of being able to purchase edibles crafted by a James Beard Award-winning chef  Segal would be the pioneer  seemed more like a stoners dream come true than a legitimate business venture.And yet just a few months later, Segals first batch  aptly called Mindys First Batch  will be available in Illinois medical marijuana dispensaries starting the first week of April, with national markets to follow later this spring. Any medical marijuana card carrier can indulge. T sat down with the Mindys Hot Chocolate namesake to get an exclusive first look at her limited-edition alternative to pot brownies.How does a James Beard Awardwinning chef get into the marijuana business?About two years ago, my lawyer was handling some work for people who were working toward dispensary licenses, so he knew that the whole thing was going to happen, and he told me, You need to get in on this on the ground floor. Its perfect for you. There were lots of thoughts in my mind. The way I processed this was, at first, the way everyone else processes this: Its marijuana. Its illegal. Its a drug. And then I started thinking about all the drugs that I take  all the opiates and the painkillers and the Advil and the Zoloft and the Tylenol PM  and I started thinking, Well, what makes marijuana any different, except that its natural, its holistic? It has so many medicinal qualities to it.So I had to process all of that, and then I had to ask myself, Will this affect my reputation and whats connected to me? Will it affect my book sales? Will it affect my restaurant? And then I started thinking, Well, if it does, then thats too bad. Why am I a chef? Why do I cook? Why do I have a restaurant? Initially, the reason was, I want to make people happy. I want to make people feel good. This is just another extension of why I do what I do.How did you decide what to bake?It was very easy. Its the law that I cant do anything thats perishable. It has to be shelf-safe. And coincidentally, I already had a line of stuff that I wanted to package, which included brittles, granola bars and bites, and obviously hot chocolate.Your first batch of edibles sounds like it could have been lifted from your book, Cookie Love: dark chocolate brittle with smoked almonds and crunchy toffee bits; milk chocolate brittle with peanut butter and crunchy peanut brittle; toasted pistachios and candied citrus brittle; caramelized white chocolate brittle with graham cracker, butterscotch and crunchy blond chocolate perles My cookie recipes are very unique to me. They dont look like candy bars, and they dont look like brittle. I cant even explain them, theyre so cool. So I have these cavities, and I put chopped brittle inside first, then the almonds, then I take the candy caramel, and put it in individual places, then chocolate. Then I tap it. So when you open them up, they look weird and funky. And when you bite into them, theyre chewy and crunchy at the same time. Theyre so good.What does the edibles market currently look like? What are you up against?Most people use butane or CO2 extraction which keep the terpene in, and so when you eat them, you can taste the marijuana. Youre eating candy bars  Cheeba Chews (like Tootsie Rolls)  or EdiPure products; they buy, like, sour gummies and spray them. Were changing the landscape of edibles. Theres no question about it. We are using pure cannabis oil extracted via fractional distillation, a process that 100 percent extracts the terpene out of the cannabis so that there is no flavor. Its also very expensive.So by the nature of your high-quality product, youre weeding out the market, so to speak.Those people who are eating edibles that are young and just want to get high, theyre going to get older. And in a couple of years, theyre going to have a job and more money and a more sophisticated palate. Theres nobody thats not going to enjoy this product. Theyre higher end. No pun intended.Youre the first James Beard Awardwinning chef to cross over into the edible marijuana market. What does it mean to you?This is not a joke. Im super-excited about it. Ive really gotten into it. I mean, Im smoking so much more weed than I ever have! (laughs) But now, its about much more than the product for me. Im really into the advocacy of legalization and the education of people that are sick, of people that are doing it recreationally to do it wisely, to do it smartly. Im in deep. This has become my life. Im still in the restaurant industry and still going to write cookbooks, but I want to help people and educate them about their well-being with marijuana in their life. Im also very politically involved in it now. I want to be a spokesperson, and I want to be an advocate, and I want to be a model and a leader in the industry, and I want to approach it the same way I approach my food: with integrity and core value. And Im not just schmaltzing. Im serious. This is serious. Im very, very, very into it.This interview has been edited and condensed."}
{"text": "SYDNEY, Australia  The authorities said Thursday that two pieces of debris found in Mozambique were highly likely to have come from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which has been missing for more than two years.A third piece of debris, found in South Africa and bearing part of the logo from the engine maker Rolls-Royce, has yet to be analyzed.Darren Chester, the Australian infrastructure and transport minister, said in a statement that an investigation team from Malaysia had found that both pieces of debris were consistent with panels from a Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 aircraft.The analysis has concluded the debris is almost certainly from MH370, Mr. Chester said.Martin Dolan, a commissioner at Australias Transport Safety Bureau, said there were no serial numbers on the two parts. But we are very certain these are from MH370, he said in a telephone interview.He said drift modeling by Australian scientists had indicated that ocean currents were likely to carry debris from the southern Indian Ocean, where the plane is believed to have crashed, to the coasts of Mozambique and Runion Island. In July, beachcombers found a wing part known as a flaperon on Runion, a French island east of Madagascar; it was later confirmed to be from Flight 370.In February, Blaine Gibson, an American lawyer and adventurer, found one of the two pieces of debris discovered on Mozambiques coast, a triangular piece of fiberglass composite. Mr. Dolan said a family from South Africa, on a sailing vacation, found the other piece, and that they had taken it home to Durban before realizing it could be a part of Flight 370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, with 239 people on board.The plane vanished en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and is believed to have veered off course, flown south for several hours and crashed into the southern Indian Ocean. Four search vessels have been scouring the seabed off the remote southwestern coast of Australia for wreckage from the plane, but none has yet been found there.Mr. Dolan said that the debris from Mozambique would be analyzed in an attempt to learn more about the planes last minutes, but that any new information was unlikely to affect the ongoing search in the southern Indian Ocean. A more detailed report on the debris will be prepared in consultation with the Malaysian authorities, he said."}

He insisted that he had broken no laws during his friendship and professional partnership with his senior political adviser, Rebekah Caldwell Mason, who holds such power in Alabama that Spencer Collier, a former state law enforcement secretary, on Wednesday referred to her as the de facto governor.Mr. Bentleys public demonstration of remorse came nearly seven months after Dianne Bentley, to whom the Republican governor was married for 50 years, sought a divorce, and just hours after Mr. Collier, the recently ousted leader of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, described what he saw as a history of improper conduct between the governor and Ms. Mason. Mr. Collier said that Mr. Bentley had, in 2014, effectively acknowledged an affair, and that it appeared to be continuing as recently as last month.Mr. Bentley, 73, repeatedly signaled that he had no intention of resigning. Although the governors personal behavior has long been a subject of speculation here in the capital, it was not clear Wednesday how his admission would affect his standing among his constituents in this socially conservative state, where he easily won a second term less than two years ago.Bentley rode a white horse, said Steve Flowers, a former state legislator who is now a political columnist. The thing that has been so novel about this is that Bentley won the governors office and had high approval ratings because it appeared he was this First Baptist Church of Tuscaloosa deacon who looked like somebodys grandfather and, frankly, someones great-grandfather.Now Mr. Bentleys reputation and legacy are at risk, in large part because of his communications with Ms. Mason, a political impresario who helped engineer and maintain his rise to power. In a statement that Mr. Bentleys office distributed Wednesday, Ms. Mason did not address the nature of her relationship with the governor, but said she was proud of what I have accomplished in my professional career.She accused Mr. Collier of clear, demonstrated gender bias and said, There is no way that man would have said what he did today about another man.Ms. Mason is a controversial figure here in Montgomery, and one with seemingly unrivaled influence with Mr. Bentley. She is no longer on the states payroll  many details about her compensation are unclear  but she is a frequent presence in Mr. Bentleys suite at the Capitol.Amid Wednesdays wave of criticism and questions, the governor and Mr. Collier offered deeply divergent accounts of Mr. Bentleys relationship with Ms. Mason, who is married.Mr. Collier, who served with Mr. Bentley in the Legislature, said he first became aware of the relationship in August 2014, after a member of the governors security detail observed a text that was sexual in nature. (The security officer, Stan Stabler, who succeeded Mr. Collier as law enforcement secretary, called that account false.) Within days, Mr. Collier said he heard a recording of an inappropriate sexual conversation.The Alabama Media Group on Wednesday posted an excerpt from what it said was a recording of a telephone conversation between Mr. Bentley and Ms. Mason. In the segment, he refers to when I stand behind you and I put my arms around you and I put my hands on your breasts. Later, the governor said, If were going to do what we did the other day, were going to have to start locking the door.Mr. Collier said he ultimately learned that someone in Mr. Bentleys family had made the recording he heard, and he confronted the governor in August 2014, as they traveled to an event in Greenville, Ala.I told Governor Bentley that I loved him like a father and that there was nothing I wouldnt do for him, except lie to a grand jury, Mr. Collier said Wednesday, his left hand sometimes trembling. I made Governor Bentley aware of the recording that I heard. I told Governor Bentley there was no need to try and explain it for anything other than it was. It was very obvious that it was sexual in nature.Mr. Bentley, Mr. Collier said, simply hung his head and asked for advice on how to get out of it. According to Mr. Collier, he warned the governor that using state resources to facilitate an affair amounted to a crime. Mr. Collier said Mr. Bentley assured him that he had violated no laws.Joseph C. Espy III, a lawyer whom Mr. Collier said represented Mr. Bentley in some personal matters, did not respond to a phone call or an email. (Mr. Bentleys campaign paid Mr. Espys law firm nearly $25,000 last year, according to campaign finance records.)A spokesman for the Alabama attorney general declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Montgomery said she could neither confirm nor deny whether federal officials were investigating the governor.Mr. Bentley and his supporters moved swiftly to discredit Mr. Collier, whom Mr. Bentley fired after an internal review found a number of issues, including possible misuse of state money. Mr. Collier has denied any wrongdoing. The dismissal was announced after the men clashed last month about Mr. Colliers intention to submit an affidavit related to the pending ethics case against Michael G. Hubbard, the speaker of the state House of Representatives. Mr. Collier said the governor had asked him to lie; Mr. Bentley denied doing so.Mr. Bentley, who appeared shaken when he stood before reporters on what he described as a difficult day, was similarly unequivocal as talk of potentially criminal conduct swirled: I can assure the people of Alabama that, as their governor, I have never done anything illegal.He said that Ms. Mason had not asked him to refrain from the remarks for which he expressed contrition, but he said he had apologized to her and others.Its not just one family, the governor said. There have been a lot of people who have been hurt by all of this, and the entire state of Alabama has suffered during this time.But there were some details, it seemed, that the governor wanted to remain out of public view. He would not, for instance, describe the extent, length or contents of his inappropriate contacts with Ms. Mason.Asked if he had only erred when he was being recorded, the governor replied with a single word: No."}
{"text": "In January, I devoted every walk from my home to the train to the contemplation of work details, hoping to improve my recall of them. That was my New Years resolution, and so far Ive stuck to it.In every one of those walks I was also retracing a memorization technique known to the ancients and shown by modern science to be highly effective.The Rhetorica ad Herennium, written in the 80s B.C. by an unknown author, is the first known text on the art of memorization. (Its also the oldest surviving Latin book on rhetoric.) It teaches the method of loci, also known as the memory palace. As its names suggest, the approach involves associating the ideas or objects to be memorized with memorable scenes imagined to be at well-known locations (loci), like ones house (palace) or along a familiar walking route.You can test the method for yourself. If youre like most people, you would not easily commit to long-term memory a 10-item shopping list. But I bet you could remember it  and for more than a few minutes  if you first visualized it along a walk through your house: The entryway of your house is festooned with toilet paper; your kitchen sink is full of lobsters, dancing; a bathtub-size stick of butter melts on your dining room table; your family is singing karaoke in a swimming pool of hummus in your living room; your hallway is so full of grapes you cannot avoid crushing them with each step; your stairway has a runner of lasagna noodles slippery with tomato sauce; a mooing cow is being milked in your bedroom; stalks of corn grow down from the ceiling in the spare bedroom; a crop of multicolored mushrooms blooms in your shower.Take a few moments to burn these images and locations into your mind (adding motion, sounds, smells and tactile sense to your imagined scenes helps). Well test your memory with an imaginary trip to the grocery store at the end of this article.Joshua Foer wrote a book about how he trained to win the United States Memory Championship. He points out that were so good at forming mental maps and recalling images that we hardly notice it. Recall the last party you attended at a home you had not previously visited. Though you probably only walked through the house a few times, you can probably remember most or all of its layout and location of major furniture. Anything else distinctive you saw  like unusual or appealing pieces of art, vivid wall colors  and the faces of people you met are probably also easy to recall. Effortlessly, you retained hundreds or thousands of visual memories and spatial details.Research backs this up. After people viewed thousands of images for a few seconds each, studies found that, on average, they could correctly distinguish over 80 percent of them from images they had not seen. This remained true even when the comparison images were of the same object in a slightly different position (like the same cabinet open versus closed or the same telephone at a different angle). Another study found people could usually recall objects theyd seen even after seeing hundreds of intervening ones, demonstrating that visual memories of objects are stored long-term.It makes sense, then, that numerous studies, extending back decades, show that the method of loci improves memory. Using the approach, people who could remember only a handful of numbers  seven is the norm, give or take a few  were trained to recall 80 to 90.Another study found that the method doubled the proportion of people who could remember at least 11 of 12 grocery list items. Students who applied it in an undergraduate economics course outperformed those who did not on an exam. Medical students who used the method of loci to study the endocrine system learned more than those who did not.Patients who have had treatments known to impair recall and cognitive function  like coronary bypass surgery and surgery and chemotherapy for breast cancer  improved their memories with the method of loci. As a memory aid, its superior to rote memorization and converting items to images alone. Placing those images in a memory palace helps recall.Before books were common, the method of loci helped lawyers and others retain and recall information necessary for their jobs. The locution in the first place is a holdover from this ancient method of memorizing speeches. It works because it harnesses humans evolved skill at remembering details of locations, which helped hunter-gatherers recall what was edible and where to find it, and what was poisonous and how to avoid it.It does not take an extraordinary mind to develop an extraordinary memory. Competitors in memory championships or those seen on Foxs Superhuman  memory athletes  werent born with photographic memories. They have practiced for years using the method of loci, supercharged with other mnemonic methods. With them, some can memorize hundreds of random numbers in a few minutes or the order of cards in a deck in tens of seconds. But, as Mr. Foer learned, memory athletes memories excel only in areas theyve trained  they still misplace their keys like the rest of us.Indeed, science shows that these are normal minds after extraordinary training  the same hardware running different software. Brain anatomy of memory athletes and those without exceptional memories are the same. Because they have trained specifically to recall numbers and faces, memory athletes outperform others in doing so. But recall of magnified images of snow crystals  for which memory athletes have not trained  is identical. After observing a game for five or 10 seconds, master chess players can recall the positions of nearly all the pieces. A novice can recall only a few. The difference is training, not exceptional memory. Shown a random configuration of pieces that could not arise in a game, chess masters are no better than novices at piece position recall.My commute has become my memory palace, not for groceries, but for aspects of my work. Features of certain landmarks  specific houses and parks I pass  have become loci for them, converted to images and scenes of my own invention. I figuratively walk through my work as I literally walk to it. For example, I associated an analysis of the time patients wait for care with cars waiting at an intersection I cross.We think memorizing is laborious, boring work because weve been taught to do it by rote. You may recall, as I do, countless hours in third grade poring over multiplication tables or, in ninth grade, endlessly conjugating French (or Spanish) verbs, or in 11th grade, incessantly reciting Macbeths Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow soliloquy in the attempt to firmly place them in long-term memory. These brute-force approaches are dull because theyre devoid of any creativity.In contrast, the best memorizers place the most flamboyant, bizarre, crude and lewd images and scenes (and their actions) in their memory palaces. The more distinctive, the more easily theyre recalled. This is why the Puritans recoiled from the method of loci  they knew students were relying on impure and idolatrous imagery  and it fell out of favor as an educational tool. Today our memories are eroded by external memory devices like cellphone cameras and apps.Now, about that grocery list. In your mind, enter and walk back through your house. What do you see? Can you get all 10 items?(Separately, weve created a short interactive quiz that tests your memory. Give it a try.)"}
{"text": "Forget that parade on the avenue, Fifth Avenue.The sensation of Easter Sunday 1912 was The New York Times, which published reproductions in their actual colors of Edwin Austin Abbeys splendid suite of paintings, The Quest and Achievement of the Holy Grail, at the Boston Public Library. By The Timess own account, the special supplement was so instantaneously popular that the demand exceeded the supply by more than 50,000 copies.Within a few days, a speculator in Woonsocket, R.I., had cornered the market by buying up dozens of copies of the five-cent paper through a newsdealer (who was given a one-penny discount). In turn, the speculator was selling the papers to the public for 50 cents each  an 1,150 percent profit, as The Times reported, to its own apparent astonishment.That kind of success deserved repeating, and so the Easter Times color edition was born.Eight old masters from the collection of J.P. Morgan were featured in the 1913 Easter Times supplement. Grateful for the opportunity to show such sumptuous paintings in full color, The Times lost itself in a reverent description of the plutocrat: Mr. Morgan is a great collector, but he is even more emphatically a great man with a vast interest in humanity and the history of humanity.Abandoning any restraint in marketing the supplement, The Times showed proofs of the section to prominent artists. None less than Childe Hassam, a leading American Impressionist, was quoted as saying about the full-page rendition of Madonna and Child Enthroned With Saints by Raphael: This reproduction interests me just as much as the original.Another renowned collector, Benjamin Altman, the founder of the B. Altman & Company department store, obliged us by dying in October 1913. That provided an ideal excuse for showing some of the spectacular artwork he had bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art  including The Crucifixion, by Fra Angelico  in the Easter Times of 1914.Fast forward, eight decades.A plump green serpent by Etienne Delessert slithered across the cover of the Book Review of June 6, 1993, to begin the gradual transformation of The New York Times into a color newspaper, we reported. Our article acknowledged a bit of color printing by The Milwaukee Journal in 1891, but made no mention of the Easter Times or other color supplements of the early 20th century.How could such beautiful printing work have been lost to posterity?One culprit certainly is microfilm. This storage and reproduction system, which made it possible to condense millions of pages of newsprint into several cases of film reels, was inadvertently responsible for robbing The Times of its rich visual heritage. As shown in these comparisons, there would be no way, scrolling quickly through microfilm, to discern the lush color images that Childe Hassam compared favorably to original artwork. Over time, the groundbreaking Easter Sunday supplements were simply forgotten.Fortunately, Ryan Murphy, who works in The Timess photo archive, keeps an eye out for historical issues of the newspaper. When he found four of the eight pages from the 1914 Easter Times supplement being offered on eBay for $5, he didnt hesitate to buy them. They are now hanging in our little Timeseum.Though the display is appropriate for Easter, theres never a bad time to remember that The Times has a long history of pushing news technology to its limit and that, in this business, firsts often arent."}
{"text": "UTRECHT, The Netherlands  A pair of pink stiletto heels sprouting hair. Wool bow ties decorated with locks of human hair. Stylish coats made entirely of human hair.Go ahead, say it: Macabre. Creepy. Weird.The organizers of the exhibition HAIR!, at the Centraal Museum in Utrecht, were aware from the very beginning that there is something viscerally off-putting about using human hair as a material for art or design, especially when it ends up close to our skins. But they wanted to explore that response, and ask: Why?Something happens when hair gets separated from the body, said Harm Rensink, one of the designers of the exhibition, which runs until May 29. At the moment you dont think of it as part of the body anymore, this itchy feeling arrives. It makes you want to look, but it makes you also not want to look.Several years ago, Ninke Bloemberg, a fashion curator at the Centraal Museum, became fascinated with the common practice in the 19th century of collecting locks of a beloveds hair and asking a jeweler to fashion it into decorative jewelry, worn against the skin. The museum has a collection of such pieces.When you talk to people who are not familiar with that tradition, they always say, Ewww, Ms. Bloemberg said. Im so intrigued by that idea that you wear hair of someone else on your skin. And she was intrigued to find out if that tradition had continued in any form: What is the status of hair at this point?Ms. Bloemberg (who has long brown hair and bangs) began to research the subject of hair as an artistic material several years ago, and when she had gathered a fair amount of evidence that hair was indeed a material that contemporary artists were still exploring, she planned an exhibition. She enlisted the help of two exhibition designers, Niek Pulles (who has shoulder-length hair and a beard) and Harm Rensink (who has very short platinum blond hair), to create a dynamic flow of hair through 1,000 square meters of exhibition space.At first we wanted to focus on the repellent aspects of hair, Ms. Bloemberg said, but we thought people will bring that into the exhibition with them already. So in the end, the things we chose are all pretty attractive.The visual allure of some of the pieces, such as an elegant latticed leaf made entirely of human hair or a wood hairbrush whose bristles have been replaced with lush blond hair, can make a visitor question his or her own natural aversion. Works by other artists seem to propose hair as an untapped renewable resource, exploring how it can be employed to create something both beautiful and functional.For its project Hair Highway (2014), Studio Swine from London combined human hair with natural bio resin to invent a new composite material, from which they made objects and furniture, like a 1920s Shanghai-deco-style vanity, or dressing table, presented here.The artists, who collaborated with Pearl Lam Gallery in Hong Kong, use hair from China, noting in a project description that Asian hair grows particularly quickly, up to 16 times faster than hardwood mahogany. Its also very strong  a full head of hair can take the weight of two African elephants.The Dutch fashion and textile designer Anouk van Klaveren created an interactive performance piece, originally staged at the Salone del Mobile in Milan, in which she cut visitors hair and added it to a bow tie made of wool to create a personal bow tie. The production process was designed to mimic a factory assembly line.By combining the wool and human hair in one product, I try to make people aware of the fact that wool is also just hair, but people see it in a completely different way, she explained while installing the work in the gallery. Theres always something funny to people about using human hair, but wool is just a product to us. She added, Mass production is normal to us, but if you use human products people think about it very differently.Although there is a fashion element to the exhibition  one of the seven gallery spaces is devoted to hair in fashion  it is not a show about hairstyles. Where it does deal with hair still attached to someones head, it tends to focus on the crafting of hair into a design element, or hairs role in the exploration of identities.Almost half of the fashion room focuses on the tremendous range of the New York-based Dutch hair stylist Christiaan Houtenbos, who created many famous looks, including the singer Grace Joness signature flat-top hairstyle. The curators also put on display the styling kit that Mr. Houtenbos took to China to style Nancy Kissingers hair when she accompanied her husband, the former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, in 1979.In the same exhibition room are three family portraits by the Dutch artist Levi van Veluw from his series Natural Transfers, in which he and his mother and sister are photographed from the shoulders up, their faces obscured by hair stuck to all the contours of the face. If you look at it as a viewer, you see three portraits and think they are all the same person, Mr. Rensink said. But in the end he tricks you, because they are all different people.Some artists use single hairs as a line or thread to make intimate embroideries. For example, the Japanese-American artist Masako Takahashi, based in San Francisco, threaded strands of her own floor-length hair through a needle to stitch a diary into a Japanese silk scroll. The full scroll, about 12 meters long, will be exhibited in a narrow hallway of the exhibition. But it wont be possible to read the words, because it is written in a made-up language only she knows.One thing that is not referred to directly in the exhibition is the Nazis collection and reuse of human hair, collected before gassing victims, for example, at the Auschwitz concentration camp and sold to German companies to make household products.Everybody thinks about it, at some point when they see all this hair collected, said Mr. Pulles, one of the exhibition designers. Thats also why we made the exhibition have a darker element as well. But we wanted to also keep the frivolity and the lightness in the show, too, so its very dynamic.The Serbian artist Zoran Todorovic seems to make an oblique reference to World War II in his piece Warmth, which was originally created for the 2009 Venice Art Biennale. He collected hair from 288,000 individuals at salons, military barracks and jails across Serbia, and had the hair felted into blankets that look like gray wool. The artist also videotaped the process of collecting the hair.A pallet of the blankets is on exhibit here, and he is offering to sell them to patrons for 100 euros a piece. Probably hardly anyone will buy those, Ms. Bloemberg said. But its interesting that they can."}

{"text": "Islanders center Frans Nielsen breathed a distinct sigh of relief after his team ended a four-game winless streak, its longest of the season, with a 3-1 home victory over Ottawa on Wednesday.Then he contemplated the road ahead for the Islanders, who are still battling for a playoff spot.Ten games remain, including six in the seasons final nine days. The schedule culminates with a makeup game on April 10 against the Philadelphia Flyers, one of the teams chasing the Islanders in the Eastern Conference standings.Entering Thursdays games, the Islanders held the first wild-card spot, four points ahead of the Flyers and the Detroit Red Wings.Hopefully we keep it together, but its going to be tough, Nielsen said. Weve got to make sure to get rest where we can.The Islanders had Thursday off after the much-needed victory. They surely relished the rest, as the burden to make the most of their current opportunity is immense. For a franchise that has not won a postseason series since 1993 and is trying to make a splash in its first season in Brooklyn, the future most certainly is now.Twice in the past three seasons, the Islanders have reached the playoffs. And twice they were defeated in gripping and emotional first-round series. Nielsen said both experiences  and the grinding work required to simply reach the postseason  should prove beneficial in the weeks ahead for him and teammates like John Tavares, Kyle Okposo and Travis Hamonic.Weve come a long way, and Ive learned a lot, said Nielsen, 31, the longest-tenured Islander. You definitely learn to play with pressure.The Islanders have a two-game trip to Tampa Bay and Carolina on Friday and Saturday before returning home to play Carolina on Tuesday and Columbus on Thursday.Afterward, they have only two road games remaining: at Washington on April 5 and at the Rangers two days later. The Islanders have defeated the Rangers in all three of the games they have played this season.The Islanders have thrived at home, winning 22 of their first 35 contests in Brooklyn, with 48 home points overall. That success comes despite altered game-day routines. Since January, the Islanders have skated in the morning on Long Island before traveling to games in Brooklyn. Earlier in the season, they had tried morning skates at Barclays Center, but players ultimately did not like such long days away from home.Were starting to feel at home here with the whole routine and everything, Nielsen said. We have a lot of home games still coming up, so hopefully we can keep it up and get the points we need to get in.Wednesdays victory over Ottawa was notable for several reasons. It was only their second in eight contests (2-4-2) since the starting goaltender Jaroslav Halak went down with a lower-body injury on March 8. And it was the first time in that eight-game span in which they had a contest under control heading into the third period and held on to win.The victory provided another confidence boost for the rookie backup goalie Jean-Francois Berube. Berube, 24, who registered 13 playoff wins last spring to help lead the Manchester Monarchs to the American Hockey League championship, stopped 22 shots for his second N.H.L. win.Were hungry, said Berube, who was claimed off waivers from the Kings in October. I think we played with a little bit of desperation. We were in a little bit of a slump, but we trust the group we have here. Everyone trusts each other.The Islanders will need Berube and the de facto starter, Thomas Greiss, at their best down the stretch, especially since the team has been in an offensive funk, scoring only four goals in the four-game skid preceding the win over the Senators.Islanders Coach Jack Capuano has had three goaltenders on his roster in recent months. Halak contributed 18 wins before his injury. He recorded a career-best 38 victories last season, when the Islanders finished third in the Metropolitan Division with 101 points before losing to Washington in the first round in seven games.Greiss has played well, with 19 wins and a 2.29 goals-against average in his first season with the Islanders, but he has never started an N.H.L. playoff game. Berubes play has been sparkling recently, giving Capuano confidence heading into the seasons final weeks.When you have two guys that are battling, its all about healthy competition, he said. We have faith in both guys that if they get in there, they are going to help us do the job.For many weeks, it appeared the Islanders were on course for a first-round meeting with the Rangers, whom they have not faced in the playoffs since 1994. But with the Pittsburgh Penguins surging recently, the Islanders could also find themselves starting the playoffs against Washington, which clinched the No. 1 seed in the East this week, Tampa Bay or Florida.That remains too far ahead to conjure for Tavares, the teams captain, who leads the Islanders with 27 goals and 57 points.You move on to Tampa Bay and start with that one, he said."}
{"text": "Johan Cruyff, a brash Dutch soccer star who helped develop a style that revolutionized the way the game is played, becoming the Netherlands greatest player and later a scolding conscience of the sport, died on Thursday in Barcelona, Spain. He was 68.The cause was cancer, Cruyffs family said in a statement  on his website.Cruyff, a heavy smoker until he had heart problems in the 1990s, revealed in October that he had lung cancer. But as recently as Feb. 16 he had predicted his recovery, saying he had the feeling that I am 2-0 up in the first half of a match that has not finished yet.Widely acclaimed as one of the best players in history, Cruyff (pronounced CROYF) teamed with the famed coach Rinus Michels in the 1970s to perfect a style called Total Football, a shape-shifting system in which players switch positions effortlessly.A wiry and deceptively quick forward, Cruyff was the personification of the style, bursting forward to attack or drifting back to defend, but always ready to deliver an incisive pass or to appear in the perfect position when an opportunity to score arose.He was a proponent of beauty over efficiency, though he preferred to demonstrate both. Quality without results is pointless, he was quoted as saying. Results without quality is boring.Cruyff, though, was never boring. Supremely confident in his opinions and quick to share them, sometimes with an acid tongue, he left a trail of bitter feuds as a player, coach and executive. He quibbled about money and sponsorships, and about tactics and control. He departed his boyhood club, Ajax Amsterdam, on bad terms several times and was fired by Barcelona in 1996  four years after winning the European Cup  after a falling out with the club board.Yet the vision and adaptability inherent in the Total Football he helped create changed the way soccer was played, and lifted its adherents, notably Ajax, F.C. Barcelona and the Dutch national team, to great heights.Ajax won the first of three consecutive European Cups in 1971 with Cruyff and Michels at the controls, and the Netherlands reached consecutive World Cup finals in the 1970s, becoming known as the Clockwork Orange for the teams orange jerseys and sweeping movements.Cruyff, like Michels before him, preached Total Football at Barcelona, which Cruyff coached to its first European title in 1992 and which continues to hold to t style of play as its guiding philosophy. His influence on the clubs youth academy and players and coaches like Pep Guardiola set a foundation for Barcelonas, and Spains, recent era of trophies and championships.The former England striker Gary Lineker, who played for Cruyff at Barcelona, said, Football has lost a man who did more to make the beautiful game beautiful than anyone in history.Hendrik Johannes Cruyff was born on April 25, 1947, in Amsterdam, and grew up in a working-class neighborhood that was only a short walk from the Ajax training facility. He joined the club as a 10-year-old and made his first-team debut at 17 in 1964. Michels arrived a year later, and together they turned Ajax into one of the best teams in the world.With Cruyff directing the Total Football symphony Michels had designed, Ajax won the European Cup, the forerunner of the UEFA Champions League, three straight times, from 1971 to 1973. In 1973, Cruyff joined Michels at Barcelona for a transfer fee of about $14.1 million in todays dollars, a record at the time. A year after that they led the Netherlands to the World Cup final in Germany.The Dutch took a 1-0 lead in that game before the Germans even touched the ball, stringing together 17 passes from the opening kickoff until Cruyff won a penalty, which Johan Neeskens converted. But Germany answered with two goals, denying Cruyff and his country a title they have yet to claim.That final, like the Barcelona transfer, offered a glimpse of Cruyffs mercenary side. The Dutch federation had signed a sponsorship with Adidas for that years World Cup, but Cruyff, who had his own deal with rival Puma, refused to wear the teams official uniform, believing that to do so would be a conflict. To appease their star, Dutch officials relented and allowed Cruyff to play in a custom-made shirt bearing only two stripes on the sleeves instead of Adidass famed three.Honored as Europes best player in 1971, 1973 and 1974, Cruyff won nine Dutch League titles in Holland (eight with Ajax and one with Feyenoord at the end of his career) and another in Spain with Barcelona. He later coached Ajax and Barcelona, with whom he won four Spanish titles and his fourth European club title. But despite flirtations with the Dutch federation, he never led his national team.Cruyff retired from international soccer in 1977, missing the Netherlands return to the World Cup final in 1978 in Argentina. The reason given at the time was that he opposed the military dictatorship in Argentina; years later, however, he revealed to a Catalonian radio station that he and his family had been subjected to a kidnapping attempt in Barcelona a few months before the tournament.He left Barcelona in 1978 but returned to the game a year later when he signed a $1.4 million deal with the Los Angeles Aztecs of the North American Soccer League. At the time, he credited his comeback, at age 32, to his love for the sport and to the chance to bring the game to a new place; in reality, he acknowledged, he had lost money in a series of investments and saw the rich contract with the N.A.S.L. as a welcome payday.He played for one season with the Aztecs and another with the Washington Diplomats before returning to Europe for a brief tenure with Spains Levante and then a return to Ajax. When Ajax did not offer him a new contract in 1983, he signed with rival Feyenoord  and promptly won the league and Dutch Cup double at age 37 before retiring for good.The English journalist David Miller labeled him Pythagoras in boots for his ability to see open space and advantageous angles on a field. David Winner, in his book on Dutch soccer, Brilliant Orange, compared Cruyffs play to the perfection and organization of a Vermeer painting.His game was so sublime that he has a move named after him: the Cruyff turn, a deft sleight-of-foot maneuver in which he teased defenders in one direction before using his heel to push the ball behind him and a burst of speed to break away.There is no better medal than being acclaimed for your style, he said in 1998 after watching another eye-pleasing Dutch team try, and fail, to win the World Cup.But as much as he prized elegant play, Cruyff loathed teams that turned away from his ideals. When the Netherlands reached the World Cup final in 2010, Cruyff decried the teams bruising style as antifootball.This ugly, vulgar, hard, hermetic, hardly eye-catching, hardly football style, yes, it served the Dutch to unsettle Spain, he told a Spanish newspaper. If with this they got satisfaction, fine, but they ended up losing.Spain won the final, 1-0, playing with a possession-based style more to Cruyffs liking, and with a goal scored by a player, Andrs Iniesta, who had emerged from the Barcelona youth system Cruyff had nurtured.Cruyff is survived by his wife of 47 years, Danny Coster; two daughters, Chantal and Susila; and a son, Jordi, who followed his father into professional soccer, playing with Barcelona and Manchester United, and coaching."}
{"text": "Who says they dont make mind-bending French science-fiction animated movies like they used to? Well, very few people, if any, I reckon. But the thought  or something similar to it  crossed my mind while watching April and the Extraordinary World, a beautiful, inventive and uncannily satisfying new example of animated sci-fi from, yes, France.Directed by Christian Desmares and Franck Ekinci, adapting a graphic novel by the revered artist Jacques Tardi, April has an alternate-history peg thats irrepressibly Gallic. In the late 19th century, a scheme hatched by Napoleon III to engineer supersoldiers scientifically goes horribly awry. The result is an early 20th century of stunted technology. Instead of wars over oil, there are wars over charcoal. And every scientist who shows promise  Einstein, Fermi, you name em  disappears from public view in short order.What gives? In a sooty gray Paris with twin Eiffel Towers, April (voiced in both the French- and English-language versions by Marion Cotillard), the adult daughter of two missing scientists, seeks answers. Assisting her is a talking cat named Darwin. Among those pursuing her is a slapstick Javert of a police agent with an old grudge, aided reluctantly by a young pickpocket.April arguably belongs to the genre called steampunk, but the movies designs and contraptions also evoke Jules Verne, the Czech animator Karel Zeman, Fritz Langs Metropolis and more. Influences aside, the movie so teems with delightful detail and has such an exuberant sense of play that it feels entirely fresh. While it bears little overt resemblance to the 1973 French animated marvel Fantastic Planet, for me, at least, April bestows a similar sense of otherworldly exhilaration.April and the Extraordinary World is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for action and peril, including gunplay, some thematic elements and rude humor."}
{"text": "Health savings accounts offer a rare, triple-tax benefit to those who are able to contribute and who qualify to save for future medical needs  which, among other things, means having a health insurance plan with a deductible of at least $1,300. Money goes into an H.S.A. tax-free, grows tax-free and is withdrawn tax-free, if spent on eligible medical costs.Yet some people find it difficult to commit to building up an H.S.A. to save for health needs. At the end of last year, there were nearly 17 million accounts with balances totaling more than $30 billion, according to the H.S.A. tracking firm Devenir. But most of the money sits in savings accounts, paying anemic interest rates; just 14 percent of the total was in investment accounts with more growth potential (and, of course, the possibility of loss).H.S.A.s have been around for more than 10 years, but many still confuse them with workplace flexible spending accounts, or F.S.A.s, another tax-favored saving tool. F.S.A.s are available only through employers. Workers cant take the money with them if they change jobs, and they cant invest the funds; the accounts are meant to be spent on current costs, and in some cases the funds are forfeited if they arent spent by an annual deadline.Some savers may not have the minimum balance needed to invest, or may need money now to pay for care; some may not like the investment options their H.S.A. offers. But its frustrating that many people arent using the accounts to their full potential, said Laura Scharr-Bykowsky, a financial planner in Columbia, S.C.That money will never be taxed, she said. Why wouldnt you want to max out that gift the I.R.S. has given you?The reasons are likely to include not only a lack of understanding about how the accounts work but also mental or emotional stumbling blocks. While saving for retirement in a 401(k) or an I.R.A. may evoke pleasant images of travel, hobbies and time spent with grandchildren, saving for medical costs might inspire a sense of dread, said Michael Herndon, vice president of financial resilience with AARP.Marty Martin, a psychologist in Chicago who counsels clients of the Planning Center, a financial planning firm, said one factor in saving for the future was hyperbolic discounting  the tendency to favor smaller rewards now over potentially larger rewards in the future. Theyd rather spend money on whats here today, he said.An individuals perceived vulnerability, or perception of risk, comes into play, too: Youre less likely to save for something that you think wont happen, he said. Often, its not until people have a health scare themselves, he said, or see a family member have one, that the possibility of future health costs hits home.The uncertainty of just how much people may need to spend is another barrier.People dont feel like they can predict their health care needs, said Eric Dowley, senior vice president of the H.S.A. business at Fidelity.Fidelity attempts each year to project health care costs in retirement, and the estimate can be daunting. Fidelitys latest estimate is that an average heterosexual couple retiring in 2015 at age 65 will need $245,000 to cover health costs in retirement, if they have health coverage under traditional Medicare. (The estimate assumes the man lives to age 85 and the woman to age 87; it doesnt include dental services or long-term care). Other estimates of health costs in retirement are even higher.To help consumers get an idea of how much they should target for savings long-term, financial advisers suggest two online calculators, theAARP health care costs calculator, prepared with OptumHealth Financial Services, and Living to 100, a life expectancy tool.A health savings account is available to employees and independent workers, and the money follows workers from one job to another. Theres no use it or lose it deadline with an H.S.A. and, while the money can be spent on current costs, it also may be saved for long-term expenses because it rolls over each year, an aspect that financial planners prefer.However, only people with specific kinds of health insurance can contribute to an H.S.A. The accounts must be paired with health plans that meet strict criteria, including a high deductible (at least $1,300 for an individual and $2,600 for a family, in 2016), and an out-of-pocket maximum of no more than $6,550 for an individual and $13,100 for a family.Ms. Scharr-Bykowsky said that even clients who could afford to do so often resisted her advice to pay for current health costs with other funds and let the H.S.A. grow.Users also dont realize, planners say, that they can reimburse themselves from the account in the future for costs incurred today.Limits on annual contributions to health savings accounts are relatively low. For 2016, the maximum contribution is $3,350 for an individual and $6,750 for a family. (People age 55 or older can add an extra $1,000 as a catch-up contribution.)If H.S.A. money is spent on nonhealth care needs before turning 65, youll pay a 20 percent penalty on the funds spent, in addition to regular income tax. But after age 65, the penalty goes away, and funds, then taxable, can be spent on nonhealth needs.If you look at estimates of retirement health care costs as being in the quarter-million-dollar range, its hard to think you could oversave for that, said David Armes, a financial planner specialized in health care in Long Beach, Calif."}

{"text": "Since National Sawdust opened in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in October, it has been an intimate, adaptable space for modest-size concerts. While it is no place for traditional opera, a performance on Wednesday night demonstrated that it might be ideal for productions that revitalize the art form at a time when it could use some shaking up.Under the auspices of National Sawdust and the Manhattan School of Music, the inventive director and visual artist Doug Fitch and the superb countertenor Anthony Roth Costanzo presented Orphic Moments, a pairing of a new dramatic cantata by the young composer Matthew Aucoin with an innovative staging of Glucks Orfeo ed Euridice, with Mr. Aucoin conducting the Manhattan School of Music Chamber Sinfonia.Mr. Aucoins work, The Orphic Moment, probes the psychology of the crucial turning point from the myth of Orpheus in an anguished 16-minute dramatic scene. We find Orpheus leading his beloved Eurydice from the realm of the dead back to life on earth, struggling to uphold the command of the gods that he not look at her during the journey. But this Orpheus does turn around, on purpose.The piece suggests that Orpheus, a celebrated singer, knows that loss and heartbreak are the most moving subjects for song. Maybe he covets deathly separation as a spur to inspiration. In Mr. Aucoins pulsing, fitful score, the orchestra simmers with rattling ostinatos and darting lines. The vocal writing is impassioned and fiery, sometimes to the point that some of Mr. Aucoins poetic text  the complex thoughts of a distraught lover and complex artist  was lost. In an affecting touch, Eurydice was portrayed by a dancer (Bobbi Jene Smith) and a violinist (Keir GoGwilt), who often stood back to back.The Orphic Moment ends at the very instance when Orpheus loses Eurydice for a second time. Then, in a novel twist, audience members had a minibanquet: little servings of food placed on long wood panels poised on our knees. As we partook in this wedding feast for Orpheus and Eurydice, Mr. Aucoin conducted the orchestra in selected dance episodes from the opera. Meal over, Glucks Orfeo began.Mr. Fitchs gripping production of a trimmed version of the opera made a virtue of the spaces smallness. (In this arrangement, it had seats for just 145 people.) The orchestra players sat by the back wall. Above them was a wood platform, which became the stage for both dramas. It was thrilling, even sometimes frightening, to be so close when Mr. Costanzo, who combines a powerful voice with a charismatic presence, sent phrases soaring in both works.Mr. Costanzo, a magnificent Orfeo, was joined by the sweet-voiced soprano Kiera Duffy as Euridice. The soprano Jana McIntyre, appearing in the balcony, was the god Amor. The chorus sang from National Sawdusts entrance area. The performance stopped cold at the very instance in the opera at which Orfeo looks back, then an unearthly little coda for violin and orchestra by Mr. Aucoin provided a grimly dramatic end to the evening.This modest production presents a vivid new spin on operatic performance. But why does it run for just two consecutive evenings, and for fewer than 300 people?"}
{"text": "AN interesting obituary appeared in The New York Times recently, though the death of its subject last month was largely unnoticed beyond his family and friends.Thats not surprising. Delmer Berg wasnt a celebrity. He wasnt someone with great wealth or influence. He had never held public office. He was a Californian. He worked as a farmhand and stonemason. He did some union organizing. He was vice president of his local N.A.A.C.P. chapter. He protested against the Vietnam War and nuclear weapons. He joined the United States Communist Party in 1943, and, according to The Times, he remained an unreconstructed Communist for the rest of his life. He was 100.He was also the last known living veteran of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.Not many Americans younger than 70 know much about the Lincoln Brigade. It became the designation given to the nearly 3,000 mostly American volunteers who fought in the Spanish Civil War in 1937 and 1938. They fought on the Republican side, in defense of the democratically elected leftist government of Spain, and against the Nationalists, the military rebels led by Gen. Francisco Franco.The Nationalists claimed their cause was anti-Communism and the restoration of the monarchy, and the Republicans professed to fight for the preservation of democracy. Fascists led the former, while Communists, both the cynical and nave varieties, sought control of the latter. And into the Republican camp came idealistic freedom fighters from abroad.The Lincoln Brigade was originally called a battalion, one of several volunteer units that were part of the International Brigades, the name given the tens of thousands of foreign volunteers who came from dozens of countries, and were organized and largely led by the Comintern, the international Communist organization controlled by the Soviets. Francos Nationalists were supported by Nazi Germany and Mussolinis Italy.Spain became the theater where the three most powerful ideologies of the 20th century  Communism, fascism and self-determination  began the war that would continue, in some form or another, for more than half the century until the advocates of liberty, and their champion, the United States, prevailed.Not all the Americans who fought in the Lincoln Brigade were Communists. Many were, including Delmer Berg. Others, though, had just come to fight fascists and defend a democracy. Even many of the Communists, like Mr. Berg, believed they were freedom fighters first, sacrificing life and limb in a country they knew little about, for a people they had never met.You might consider them romantics, fighting in a doomed cause for something greater than their self-interest. And even though men like Mr. Berg would identify with a cause, Communism, that inflicted far more misery than it ever alleviated  and rendered human dignity subservient to the state  I have always harbored admiration for their courage and sacrifice in Spain.I have felt that way since I was boy of 12, reading Hemingways For Whom the Bell Tolls in my fathers study. It is my favorite novel, and its hero, Robert Jordan, the Midwestern teacher who fought and died in Spain, became my favorite literary hero. In the novel, Jordan had begun to see the cause as futile. He was cynical about its leadership, and distrustful of the Soviet cadres who tried to suborn it.But in the final scene of the book, a wounded Jordan chooses to die to save the poor Spanish souls he fought beside and for. And Jordans cause wasnt a clash of ideologies any longer, but a noble sacrifice for love.The world is a fine place and worth the fighting for, Jordan thinks as he waits to die, and I hate very much to leave it. But he did leave it. Willingly.Mr. Berg went to Spain when he was a very young man. He fought in some of the biggest and most consequential battles of the war. He sustained wounds. He watched friends die. He knew he had ransomed his life to a lost cause, for a people who were strangers to him, but to whom he felt an obligation, and he did not quit on them. Then he came home, started a cement and stonemasonry business and fought for the things he believed in for the rest of his long life.I dont believe in most of the things that Mr. Berg did, except this. I believe, as Donne wrote, no man is an island, entire of itself. He is part of the main. And I believe any mans death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.So was Mr. Berg. He didnt need to know for whom the bell tolls. He knew it tolled for him. And I salute him. Rest in peace."}
{"text": "Ken Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney, dropped a memorable line at the end of his letter this week recommending no prison time for Peter Liang, the former New York City police officer convicted of manslaughter last month in the fatal shooting of an unarmed man in a housing project stairwell.There are no winners here, he wrote.Mr. Thompson was referring primarily to the two chief players in the tragic drama: Mr. Liangs victim, Akai Gurley  a completely innocent man who lost his life for no reason  and Mr. Liang himself, who has already lost his job and who stands to lose his freedom when he is sentenced next month.But along the way the case has had winners, and losers, though it has at times been hard to tell them apart. When Mr. Thompsons letter was released on Wednesday, Mr. Gurleys family and criminal-justice reform activists expressed outrage, just several weeks after having applauded Mr. Liangs conviction, and before that his indictment. In a stark but mirroring contrast, the citys police unions and many in its Chinese-American community denounced the indictment and conviction, but they are now praising prosecutors and cheering the prospect that Mr. Liang, who is of Chinese heritage, might avoid prison.If the best settlements are those in which each side leaves unhappy, then it could be that Mr. Thompson has himself emerged a winner, if a battered one, near the end of the sort of polarizing police misconduct case that can define a district attorneys career. A first-term prosecutor with electoral potential, he had much to lose by even pursuing the case, which was fraught from the start with legal hurdles and political pitfalls.A blameless man had been killed by the police, but the officer was not one with a history of violence or who had obviously acted out of malice. Instead, he was a rookie officer on a dangerous assignment who had only recently left the Police Academy.In the end, Mr. Thompson has arguably managed to get the best he could: praise and fury from nearly everyone involved.What is all but impossible to divine is how, or even whether, Mr. Thompson, a Democrat, weighed the unofficial but unavoidable considerations: the politics of a diverse borough that made him the first black district attorney in Brooklyns history; the tension that prosecutors face in weighing justice and mercy; and the powerful influence of the Police Department, whose officers work closely with him and his staff and which once counted his mother among its ranks.Or perhaps, Mr. Thompson, who declined to be interviewed for this article, just went with his gut.Prosecutors face enormous pressure, said Representative Kathleen M. Rice, a Democrat who once served as the Nassau County district attorney. If youre not prepared to be disliked by one or both sides in a criminal case, then being a D.A. is probably not the job for you.From the moment in November 2014 that Mr. Thompson learned of Mr. Gurleys death  by a ricocheting bullet in a dark stairwell of the Louis H. Pink Houses in East New York  he found himself confronting bedeviling facts: the innocent victim, the broken lights in the notoriously dangerous housing project, and the inexperience of Mr. Liang and his partner.On the other hand, as Mr. Thompsons prosecutors pointedly noted at the trial, Mr. Liang and his partner failed to assist Mr. Gurley even after they realized the bullet had actually struck someone.Politically, Mr. Thompson faced a mix of competing constituencies, none of which were timid in expressing their opinions. Much of the police force, which carries out most of the investigative legwork for a district attorneys prosecutions, said Mr. Liang should not be indicted. Large swaths of the citys growing Asian-American population expressed the same sentiment.At the same time, the shooting came only four months after the death of Eric Garner, another unarmed black man, who was killed in an encounter with the police on Staten Island. The case fueled protests in New York and across the country, especially after a grand jury declined to indict the officer who had placed Mr. Garner in a chokehold, which was a cause of his death.Adding to the already considerable pressure was Mr. Thompsons own biography: He was both Brooklyns first black district attorney, who had campaigned as a reformer promising to restore a sense of fairness to communities of color, and the son of a police officer who understood, from personal experience, the exigencies of police work.He was in an extremely difficult spot because he had to reconcile a number of different interests, said Alan Vinegrad, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Mr. Thompson in the late 1990s on the Abner Louima police brutality case. Forget about the politics, strictly from a do-the-right thing perspective, it was hard to achieve justice for the victim.For nearly a year and a half, Mr. Thompson has been saying that his decisions in the Gurley case have been driven by the evidence, not politics. And yet it remains that the office of district attorney is an elected one. Even many of his loudest critics, including those, like Mr. Liangs lawyer, who thought that an indictment should never have been brought, have said his sentencing decision was at the very least reasonable.Mr. Thompsons letter is only a recommendation, and the final sentencing decision rests with Justice Danny K. Chun of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, who could give Mr. Liang as much as 15 years in prison.But by urging only probation and a brief period of house arrest, Mr. Thompson, wittingly or not, has created a situation in which a sentence that includes any time behind bars could seem a tough penalty and perhaps mollify some of those who opposed his recommendation.Whatever political fallout there is from his decision is likely to emerge only in time as he seeks re-election or tries for higher office. As People v. Liang returns again to the courthouse for the sentencing on April 14, legal questions will take precedence.Did the officer win? No, Mr. Vinegrad said. Did the victim win? Obviously not. Did the various communities on either side win? Not really. Who was the winner? You could argue it was the justice system."}
{"text": "I LEARNED to drive a manual transmission in a first-generation Honda Civic when others in my drivers ed class turned up their noses at such a puny machine. It came to the United States market in 1973 with a 50-horsepower engine.My classmates preferred training on the Oldsmobile Cutlasses and Pontiac Grand Ams. Who could have guessed those American brands would disappear and that sprout from Japan would flourish?Honda has wheeled out Generation 10 of its Civic, correcting some of the material and design missteps of the last one. (For me, the evolving generations are sobering reminders of which high school reunion is on the horizon.)This is a formidable competitor to the likes of the Toyota Corolla, the Mazda 3, the Ford Focus and the Chevy Cruze. More powerful, comfortable, spacious, fuel-efficient and stylish, the Civic runs on a new platform. The car is some three inches longer and two inches wider than the previous model, yet it weighs around 70 pounds less. Kudos to the engineers.A new Touring model features technology that even the higher-end Accord lacked a few years ago, such as adaptive cruise control, auto braking and an aggressive assist system to keep the car in lanes. Its wired for Android Auto and Apple Car Play, too.Throw in heated leather chairs and a 450-watt sound system, and this package as tested has a price of $27,335. Base LX models start at $19,475 with a 2-liter, 4-cylinder engine coupled to a 6-speed manual transmission.The Civic Touring scoots briskly, powered by a 1.5-liter turbo 4 with 174-horsepower and 162 pound-foot of torque on standard-grade gas. It is rated by the E.P.A. at 31 city and 42 highway; I got 29 miles per gallon in mostly city driving, though I tend to drive aggressively.The turbo is coupled to a continuously variable transmission that mercifully banishes most of the common elastic C.V.T. dynamics. A sport mode? Yes, but no manual-shift ability. It can go from zero to 60 m.p.h. in just under seven seconds, according to Car and Driver. But drivers in rainy climates like Seattle take note: The Firestone tires dont clutch well on wet pavement.Hard cornering reveals some understeer, but the Civic is sprightly with brake torque vectoring and road feel through the steering wheel. Although driving enthusiasts will turn to Mazda or the coming Civic Si for handling, the Civics quiet, comfortable dynamic is what most car buyers want.Slim A pillars offer terrific visibility for drivers. Signal right, and the LCD screen reveals blind spots on the highway, but some may find this function distracting in city driving.The previous two-tiered dashboard seemingly inspired by Jean-Luc Picards captains chair has been banished to the neutral zone. Materials and finish are a solid step up from the last generation. Attention Honda: I still plead for a knob for the sound systems volume. The touch surface is dreadful.My wife used to know a Honda seat blindfolded, though not in a positive way, but the improved chair contours get her approval. The touch-screen user interface is fine, but a bit busy.Theres no need to upgrade to the Accord for decent back-seat room. The Civic allows most small families to live large. The rear is spacious enough for two average-size adults, and three shouldnt be much of a squeeze. The Touring gets heated seats in back, though Kia and Hyundai have long featured this.Honda once again manages to bend the space-time continuum to expand its trunk room. On average, the Corolla, Mazda 3 and others in this class swallow five warehouse-sized packages of toilet paper. Seven slide into the Civic trunk (though its hinge arms will squeeze the Charmin). If split-folding seat backs dont offer enough flexibility, a hatchback model is returning. Huzzah!The Civics silhouette has a vague resemblance to the discontinued Honda Crosstour but dresses far more fashionably. C-shape taillamps bridge into the trunk lid, and the rear pillar gets a dimensional flourish.Civic owners are plentiful and loyal. A car this good gives them no reason to stray and should draw many new owners  perhaps my former classmates  to the fold."}
{"text": "The National Football League was on the clock.With several of its marquee players retiring early after a cascade of frightening concussions, the league formed a committee in 1994 that would ultimately issue a succession of research papers playing down the danger of head injuries. Amid criticism of the committees work, physicians brought in later to continue the research said the papers had relied on faulty analysis.Now, an investigation by The New York Times has found that the N.F.L.s concussion research was far more flawed than previously known.For the last 13 years, the N.F.L. has stood by the research, which, the papers stated, was based on a full accounting of all concussions diagnosed by team physicians from 1996 through 2001. But confidential data obtained by The Times shows that more than 100 diagnosed concussions were omitted from the studies  including some severe injuries to stars like quarterbacks Steve Young and Troy Aikman. The committee then calculated the rates of concussions using the incomplete data, making them appear less frequent than they actually were.After The Times asked the league about the missing diagnosed cases  more than 10 percent of the total  officials acknowledged that the clubs were not required to submit their data and not every club did. That should have been made clearer, the league said in a statement, adding that the missing cases were not part of an attempt to alter or suppress the rate of concussions.One member of the concussion committee, Dr. Joseph Waeckerle, said he was unaware of the omissions. But he added: If somebody made a human error or somebody assumed the data was absolutely correct and didnt question it, well, we screwed up. If we found it wasnt accurate and still used it, thats not a screw-up; thats a lie.These discoveries raise new questions about the validity of the committees findings, published in 13 peer-reviewed articles and held up by the league as scientific evidence that brain injuries did not cause long-term harm to its players. It is also unclear why the omissions went unchallenged by league officials, by the epidemiologist whose job it was to ensure accurate data collection and by the editor of the medical journal that published the studies.In 2013, the N.F.L. agreed to a $765 million settlement of a lawsuit in which retired players accused league officials of covering up the risks of concussions. Some players have appealed the settlement, asking for an examination of the committees concussion research.Some retired players have likened the N.F.L.s handling of its health crisis to that of the tobacco industry, which was notorious for using questionable science to play down the dangers of cigarettes.Concussions can hardly be equated with smoking, which kills 1,300 people a day in the United States, and The Times has found no direct evidence that the league took its strategy from Big Tobacco. But records show a long relationship between two businesses with little in common beyond the health risks associated with their products.In a letter to The Times, a lawyer for the league said, The N.F.L. is not the tobacco industry; it had no connection to the tobacco industry, which he called perhaps the most odious industry in American history.Still, the records show that the two businesses shared lobbyists, lawyers and consultants. Personal correspondence underscored their friendships, including dinner invitations and a request for lobbying advice.In 1997, to provide legal oversight for the committee, the league assigned Dorothy C. Mitchell, a young lawyer who had earlier defended the Tobacco Institute, the industry trade group. She had earned the institutes highest praise for her work.A co-owner of the Giants, Preston R. Tisch, also partly owned a leading cigarette company, Lorillard, and was a board member of both the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research, two entities that played a central role in misusing science to hide the risks of cigarettes.The N.F.L.s concussion committee began publishing its findings in 2003 in the medical journal Neurosurgery. Although the database used in the studies contained numerical codes for teams and players, The Times decoded it by cross-referencing team schedules and public injury reports.The N.F.L.s concussion studies have faced questions since they were published, but even the leagues harshest critics have never suggested, and no evidence has ever arisen, that the underlying data set could be so faulty.One of the rules of science is that you need to have impeccable data collection procedures, said Bill Barr, a neuropsychologist who once worked for the Jets and who has in the past criticized the committees work.By excluding so many concussions, Mr. Barr said, Youre not doing science here; you are putting forth some idea that you already have.In an introduction to the first of the concussion committees papers, the leagues commissioner at the time, Paul Tagliabue, acknowledged the need for independent scientific research to better understand the risks of concussions.As we looked more deeply into the specific area of concussions, we realized that there were many more questions than answers, Mr. Tagliabue wrote.The committees chairman, Dr. Elliot Pellman, the team physician for the Jets, emphasized that his group aimed to produce research that was independent and meticulous.In fact, most of the dozen committee members were associated with N.F.L. teams, as a physician, neurosurgeon or athletic trainer, which meant they made decisions about player care and then studied whether those decisions were proper. Still, the researchers stated unambiguously  in each of their first seven peer-reviewed papers  that their financial or business relationships had not compromised their work.The committee said it analyzed all concussions diagnosed by team medical staffs from 1996 through 2001  887 in all. Concussions were recorded by position, type of play, time missed, even the brand of helmet.The committees statements emphasized the completeness of the data.It was understood that any player with a recognized symptom of head injury, no matter how minor, should be included in the study, one paper said.And in confidential peer-review documents, the committee wrote that all N.F.L. teams participated and that all players were therefore part of this study.Those statements are contradicted by the database.The Times found that most teams failed to report all of their players concussions. Over all, at least 10 percent of head injuries diagnosed by team doctors were missing from the study, including two sustained by Jets receiver Wayne Chrebet, who retired several years later after more concussions. Dr. Pellman, the Jets physician, led the research and was the lead author on every paper.According to the research papers, team physicians were to fill out forms specially designed for the studies to submit information about concussions  a system that went well beyond the leagues standard injury-reporting protocols. In one paper, the committee wrote, The Commissioner of the N.F.L. mandated all team physicians to complete and return forms whenever they examined a player with a head injury.But after The Times described how it had identified missing concussions, the N.F.L. said this week that the studies, in fact, never purported to include all concussions.Teams were not mandated to participate, the league said, only strongly encouraged. And some teams, a spokesman said, did not take the additional steps of supplying the initial and/or follow-up forms. He did not explain why some teams had not included all concussions identified by medical personnel.The league explained, as did the papers, that some concussions went undiagnosed in the first place because players are known to occasionally hide their symptoms of concussion from team doctors; that symptoms of concussion can be so brief that no one notices; and that doctors might have used different criteria to make concussion diagnoses.But the vast majority of omitted concussions identified by The Times were included in the N.F.L.s public injury reports, meaning that medical staffs had made the diagnoses and reported them to the league. Some of the omitted concussions were reported by the teams to the news media after a game but do not appear on the injury reports, presumably because the players status for the next game was not in doubt.The database does not include any concussions involving the Dallas Cowboys for all six seasons, including four to Mr. Aikman that were listed on the N.F.L.s official midweek injury reports or were widely reported in the news media. He and many other players were therefore not included when the committee analyzed the frequency and lasting effects of multiple concussions.Several other teams have no concussions listed for years at a time. Yet the committees calculations did include hundreds of those teams games played during that period, which produced a lower overall concussion rate.A Cowboys spokesman, Rich Dalrymple, said the team had participated, but he declined to say how many cases were reported and which players were involved. He said he did not know why the Cowboys data did not appear in the studies. A San Francisco 49ers spokesman did not return messages seeking comment about Mr. Young.Dr. Robert Cantu, one of the peer reviewers who at the time criticized the committees analyses, said, It should be an unmistakable red flag that a team does not report any concussions over multiple years.Some injuries were more severe than what was reflected in the official tally. According to committee records, St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner sustained a concussion on Dec. 24, 2000, that healed after two days. But Mr. Warners symptoms continued, and four weeks later he was ruled out of the Pro Bowl with what a league official described as lingering symptoms of that head injury.The N.F.L. declined to make Dr. Pellman available for an interview. The studys epidemiologist, John Powell, who no longer works on behalf of the league, did not respond to interview requests. Michael L. J. Apuzzo, editor of Neurosurgery when the papers were published, did not respond to interview requests.The committee and the N.F.L. have long claimed that the papers were vetted through a rigorous, confidential peer-review process before publication, which legitimized their methods and conclusions. But more than a dozen pages of anonymous back-and-forth between reviewers and the committee show some reviewers almost desperate to stop the papers publication while the authors brushed aside criticism.One reviewer wrote, Many of the management of concussion suggestions are inappropriate and not founded on facts. Another said the committees assertion that the league was handling concussions too cautiously was not proved and was therefore potentially dangerous.An author of the N.F.L. studies responded, If the truth is dangerous, then I suppose our results are dangerous.In 1992, amid rising concerns about concussions, Mr. Tisch  the Giants and Lorillard part owner  asked the cigarette companys general counsel, Arthur J. Stevens, to contact the N.F.L. commissioner at the time, Mr. Tagliabue, about certain legal issues.Mr. Stevens was not just any tobacco lawyer; he was a member of the industrys secretive Committee of Counsel, which helped direct tobacco research projects. In a letter obtained by The Times, Mr. Stevens referred Mr. Tagliabue to two court cases alleging that the tobacco and asbestos industries had covered up the health risks of their products.In one case, the family of a dead smoker sought internal documents that the tobacco industry had withheld on the grounds of lawyer-client privilege  which does not apply if invoked to cover up a crime. The judge in the case reacted angrily after reading those internal records.The documents speak for themselves in a voice filled with disdain for the consuming public and its health, the judge, H. Lee Sarokin of Federal District Court in New Jersey, wrote earlier in 1992. Tobacco lawyers succeeded in having Judge Sarokin removed from the case.Why an influential tobacco lawyer would recommend legal cases to the N.F.L. is not known, because neither Mr. Stevens nor Mr. Tagliabue would agree to be interviewed. Mr. Tisch died in 2005.Joe Lockhart, a league spokesman, said that the cases involved potential bias of judges and that there was no evidence that the letter was taken seriously.Even so, records show that, in the legal arena, the league and the tobacco industry sometimes intersected.Before joining the N.F.L., Ms. Mitchell, a young Harvard Law School graduate, had been one of five lawyers at Covington & Burling who had provided either lobbying help or legal representation to both the N.F.L. and the tobacco industry, sometimes in the same year. Mr. Tagliabue had been a partner at the firm before becoming the N.F.L.s commissioner.In 1992, Ms. Mitchell defended the Tobacco Institute against a smokers lawsuit. She also worked on behalf of the institute in a landmark secondhand smoke case, as well as for other nontobacco clients. Ms. Mitchell said she was not responsible for legal strategy in the tobacco cases.At the N.F.L., said Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman, Ms. Mitchells work for the concussion committee was administrative. She did not have any responsibility or any role in directing the research, he said.Dr. Waeckerle, the concussion committee member, offered a different view.He said Ms. Mitchell asked committee members: How can this affect us? How can this be studied? How should we view it? Is this a legitimate concern, or is this part of somebodys zeal, and do we need to be concerned?Dr. Waeckerle praised her for bringing a nonmedical voice that made members consider the risks, benefits and what are the intended and nonintended consequences of whatever we were discussing. He said, for example, that she wanted to ensure that the committees work applied only to the N.F.L., not to college or youth football.Ms. Mitchell said in an interview that she left the N.F.L. after six years for personal reasons, unrelated to her work, and that she did not recall much about the committees work.I dont think I saw any reports, she said. It was in the early stages.Ms. Mitchell added that, as the leagues assistant secretary, she had broad responsibilities beyond health and safety issues.Her contributions to the concussion committee won her thanks in five research papers  three by the N.F.L. and two by a Canadian company that did contract work for the N.F.L. The committee wrote that she worked tirelessly to initiate its research and that her efforts paved the way for successful completion of the research.On at least two occasions in the 1970s and 1980s, the N.F.L. hired a company whose client list included the Tobacco Institute to study player injuries. The league also hired a company  for a matter unrelated to player safety  that had performed a study for the tobacco industry that played down the danger of secondhand smoke.The N.F.L.s ties to tobacco are reflected in other ways. When Congress was considering legislation that dealt with when a team owner could relocate a franchise, Joe Browne, a league official sought lobbying advice from a representative of the Tobacco Institute.I would like to take the opportunity to sit down and discuss this bill with you further, Mr. Browne said in a 1982 letter to the institutes president, Sam Chilcote.Neil Austrian, a former N.F.L. president, had previously run an advertising agency that under his leadership reversed its ban on taking tobacco clients. He called Philip Morris an honorable company that sets high standards. It was during his tenure at the N.F.L. that the concussion committee was created.Years later, when the committees work drew criticism during the peer review process, its members pushed back.We are aware the findings from the N.F.L. confront some popular opinions, they wrote, but believe this study stands on its merits based on the physician evaluation of injury and quality assurance of the data."}
{"text": "The leading scorer on the Kentucky womens basketball team that will compete at home (sort of) Friday night in a round-of-16 game in the Lexington Regional was almost a one-and-done player, in the gravest sense.In contrast to the men, and especially the Kentucky men, the womens college game is where the stars stick around to write a running narrative along with a competitive legacy. In the case of Makayla Epps, the Wildcats 5-foot-10 junior guard, the storys hook is a family history that was proudly made, a tragedy that was narrowly averted and a career that has since flourished.She lived to tell about a car accident during her freshman season, in December 2013, two days after a victory at DePaul. Returning from a funeral, a car in which Epps was a passenger spun out of control on the Bluegrass Parkway and flipped several times.Sitting on the side of the road, waiting for help with her friend, who was shaken but not seriously injured, Epps was in disbelief that she was even alive. After being treated for cuts, bruises and a strained neck, Epps played in a game the next day  albeit in something of a fog  against East Tennessee.I remember it like it was yesterday, and I could still show you the spot on the road, Epps said in a telephone interview from Lexington. There, the Wildcats will play Washington in a rare appearance at Rupp Arena, home of Coach John Caliparis mens team, whose season ended with a loss to Indiana last weekend. And if you had looked at that vehicle, you would have said there was no way anyone could have walked away from it.Her father, Anthony Epps, concurred that the car was a nightmarish vision for a parent, even after the acceptable outcome.Unbelievable, he said. Somebody was looking out for her on that road that night.Makayla Epps grew up in Marion County, about an hour from Lexington, where few people of a certain age would walk past her father on the street without flashing a smile. Winning a national championship at Kentucky is akin to becoming a made man in the mob. Anthony Epps was the starting point guard on the Rick Pitino-coached Wildcats team that won the 1996 title in the New Jersey Meadowlands over Syracuse after defeating Massachusetts in the semifinals.Yes, that Massachusetts team, coached by Calipari, now the power broker of a Kentucky program that has most actively promoted  if not invented  a recruiting policy encouraging the best high school players to drop by for a season on their way to the N.B.A.In this intricately woven bluegrass tapestry, Pitino eventually moved on to become Caliparis not-so-friendly in-state rival in Louisville, where the successful womens coach, Jeff Walz, was one of many who rolled out a welcome mat for Makayla, a McDonalds all-American.She had played part of her high school career for her father at Marion County, running the point, making the plays. His only objection to her possibly attending Louisville was in what he would or would not wear.I had no problem with her going there, he said. But I said she wouldnt see me in anything red at the games. Im too much a part of Big Blue Nation.On his smartphone and in his home is a photo of him holding a 21-month-old Makayla, the first of his six children, on his Senior Night in 1997. When the 1996 team was invited back to Rupp Arena for a ring ceremony in 2013, Anthony Epps bent down and kissed the interlocking U.K. at midcourt.He did not pay the womens program much mind during the years he was establishing a career in education and coaching, mainly out of habit. Back when he played, Tennessee ruled the Southeast Conference, and the Kentucky women were so inconspicuous that even Makayla called herself a fan of Candace Parker, who led the Lady Vols to national titles in 2007 and 2008.Only when Mitch Barnhart, the Kentucky athletic director who had worked at Tennessee, reached out for Coach Pat Summitts longtime assistant, Mickie DeMoss, in 2003 did the university finally join the late 20th century surge in investing in womens teams.Susan Lax, the Kentucky womens sports information director at the time, said the most symbolic gesture was Barnharts vacating a renovated administrative wing of Memorial Coliseum, the old arena that housed the athletic department and team offices at the time, for DeMoss.Before that, you had the men in one wing, the athletic department in the other and the women downstairs, kind of in a dungeon, Lax said.In 2007, DeMoss left Kentucky, but not before beating No. 1 Tennessee in her third season, lifting the Wildcats program competitively and seeing its attendance dramatically increase.Matthew Mitchell, her successor and one-time assistant, has raised the bar with a string of seasons with 20-plus wins and six appearances in the round of 16 in eight years.Growth is one thing. Competing with the mens statewide monolith is another. The women still play most home games at the Memorial Coliseum. This season, they averaged 6,454 fans, including games against Louisville and Duke at Rupp, which drew a combined 31,575.Having played its first two N.C.A.A. tournament games in Lexington at Memorial Coliseum, it is possible for the Wildcats to make the Final Four in Indianapolis without leaving town.I expect with our men out that well have great support at Rupp, said Makayla Epps, although Evan Crane of the Kentucky sports information office tamped down expectations, explaining that the womens regionals often struggle to draw crowds and that with local high schools on spring break, many people have left Lexington for vacation.Anthony Epps will be at Rupp, in blue, watching his daughter, who has averaged 16.6 points this season while playing 35.2 minutes and shooting 47.1 percent from the field.Shes not as quick as she was when she played for me, he said. You know, the weight room and all, but she can still go around the bigger guards and muscle the smaller ones.If the Wildcats can beat Washington, the winner of top-seeded Notre Dame and Stanford would await them. More of a womens aficionado now, Anthony Epps sighed at the mention of those traditionally strong programs and said, Notre Dame is Notre Dame, and Stanford is Stanford.But his daughter has already lived through one miracle as a college basketball player. So why not recall that he won his national title as a junior and that this is the 20th anniversary? Why not dream that Makayla might as a junior be able to lead the Cats to the Final Four?Or, as she told him before the start of the tournament, Hey, at least were not in UConns bracket."}
{"text": "It didnt take long for Garry Shandling, who died Thursday at the age of 66, to ask the audience what they thought of his hair. As a stand-up comic, he led with his neuroses, telling dark and cuttingly self-deprecating jokes in between wide, needy grins. Im dating a homeless woman, goes the setup to one joke. It was easier talking her into staying over.If his anxiety could become shtick  his production company was called Hows My Hair?  he turned it into something grander and even tragic in The Larry Sanders Show, his singular, scathingly funny HBO series which not only anticipated the current golden age of television but also a more ambitious strain of brutally honest comedy. As tender as it was cynical, it was a show about friendship and betrayal and loneliness  the King Lear of talk-show satires.And it wasnt even his first groundbreaking television series. In the mid-1980s, he starred in Its Garry Shandlings Show, a deconstructionist sitcom (created with Alan Zweibel) that destroyed the fourth wall, then played with the rubble. Mr. Shandling played a stand-up comic who constantly interrupted scenes by talking to the audience about being in his own show. His opening theme song underlined the self-references: This is the theme to Garrys show, the theme to Garrys show the jingle started. Garry called me up and asked if I would write his theme song.With its formal playfulness and meta-commentary, this show did for the network sitcom (it began on Showtime but was picked up by Fox in 1988) what David Letterman achieved for late-night talk shows. Of course, Mr. Shandlings comedy, on stage and screen, was always inward looking, even self-obsessed. He was a gifted writer who could inhabit disparate voices, and his early stand-up, where he was part of the storied Comedy Store scene in Los Angeles of the 1970s, along with Andy Kaufman, Mr. Letterman and Robin Williams, displayed skill at observational humor. Its no accident that on his greatest triumph he wrote about a world that he knew well: the late-night talk show.When Mr. Shandling started as a guest host for Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show  rotating with Jay Leno, a Comedy Store colleague, as the Monday night host every other week for a stint in the late 80s  he did not look or act like a traditional host. His Jewish anxiousness and self-deprecating sexual jokes were far more common in comedy clubs than on talk shows where most hosts were coolly reserved Midwestern stoics like Johnny Carson or Jack Paar.In Larry Sanders, he stripped his own persona bare, moving from the smooth on-screen monologues to the awkward and nasty offstage politicking that examined the main characters every insecurity and narcissistic tendency. In one of the funnier episodes, Sanders engages in a heated Hollywood battle with Ben Stiller (who plays himself) over finagling a spot in People magazines annual sexiest-man-of-the-year issue. When Mr. Stiller appears on the show, amiable jokes on air turn to insults during a commercial. The two characters one-up each other in stinging put-downs until Sanders says: If you could see how Jewish you look right now.Its an ugly and ridiculous moment, a twisted parody of Jewish self-hatred that touches several raw nerves. At the same time, it involves the vainest men in the pettiest fight. Yet Mr. Shandling performs the hurt with nervy realism, finding the pathos in this silly man. Hes still the guy worried about his hair, but this time, the insecurity he displays is more (and less) than funny."}
{"text": "According to a recent survey by the Federal Reserve, 52 percent of adult smartphone owners use mobile banking services. Its easy to understand the appeal of these financial apps, as they give us the ability to get real-time updates on our account balances and spending. Research I conducted with Yaron Levi has shown that such updates can deliver real benefits, helping people cut their spending by 15.7 percent.However, many financial apps now go far beyond the delivery of information. They also allow us to perform a breathtaking range of actions. We can sell stocks, borrow money from a friend and cash out our 401(k)s, all without interacting with another person.My concern is that these so-called smartphones could encourage decisions that are not so smart, especially when it comes to our finances. I recently conducted a pilot study with John Payne of Duke University that looked at this question. We found that people did significantly worse on a test of financial literacy  we asked them questions about such things as inflation and interest rates  when they took the test on a smartphone, at least when compared with those who used pen and paper.This new data builds on a large amount of evidence outlining the potential decision-making hazards posed by digital technology. As numerous studies have found, these devices fragment our attention, leading us to multitask and to understand less of what we read. They can even encourage shortsighted choices: One study found that people ordering their pizzas online chose those with 33 percent more toppings, 20 percent more bacon and 6 percent more calories.Taken together, these studies suggest that we should be careful about making important decisions on mobile devices. Because smartphones can encourage us to tap and swipe quickly, we might neglect the long-term consequences of our behavior. A pizza smothered in bacon might taste delicious, but its probably not good for our diet. Likewise, selling stocks on a phone when markets sneeze might temporarily ease our panic, but is it good for our financial future?This research has led me to avoid making any major financial decisions on my smartphone, whether its rebalancing my 401(k) account or making an offer on a house. Im no Luddite, but I dont think mobile devices are the best medium for making major money decisions.Its worth pointing out that the retirement industry is moving in the opposite direction, introducing apps that enable us to execute nearly every conceivable financial transaction on our phones. Im particularly worried about the rush to make our retirement savings available on mobile devices.Do we really want people to be able to cash out their lifetime savings with one click while shopping at the mall? The extra money might give us a jolt of excitement. But have we thought through the tax implications? Its at moments like this that the ease and speed of smartphone decision-making can backfire.The smartphone is here to stay, consuming ever greater amounts of our mental bandwidth. The question is how we can use these remarkable devices to help us think better, not worse. Perhaps the first step is realizing that not every decision benefits from taking place on a small touch screen."}
{"text": "DOHA, Qatar  In culture, as in many things, the Middle East is a region of extremes. While Qatar and Abu Dhabi are projecting themselves into the future with state-of-the-art museums, in Syria and Iraq militants of Islamic State attack the past through the destruction of heritage sites.Those contrasting realities were highlighted at a three-day International New York Times  conference, Art for Tomorrow, in Doha last week. The conference examined the role of cities and 21st-century technology on culture in general and on artists in particular.Los Angeles is experiencing a rebirth thanks to a vibrant art scene, conference participants heard. Salford, England, long among the poorest cities in Europe, has rebounded since the opening in 2000 of The Lowry,  a cultural center, and hosts a BBC production hub. And Hong Kong is on track to get the cultural landmark it lacks with the planned opening in 2019 of the M+ Museum.Yet the theme that overshadowed all others  through its sheer urgency  was that of cultural destruction. Attendees were starkly reminded that, in August 2015, Islamic State extremists demolished temples and tombs in the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra.Culture and cultural property is always a victim of war, said Professor Peter Stone of Newcastle University. He recalled that the coalition forces that invaded Iraq in 2003 were so little aware of heritage issues that 99 percent of the damage that was done in Iraq to cultural property was either done by the coalition or enabled by the coalition.Turning to Syria, he showed a black-and-white aerial image of the Roman site of Apamea,  riddled with looters holes. The one crumb of comfort that the Islamic State has brought is that cultural protection is now firmly on the international agenda, he said. He called for an international campaign to help all countries at risk to prepare for the worst by establishing digital inventories, catalogues and detailed records of their archaeological sites, museum collections and archives.Another panelist, Martin Roth, director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, emphasized the need for sharing information. Museums have to work together  we need more intelligence, we just dont talk to each other, he said. If the major museums had more joint forces, it would help a lot.Presiding over the symposium was the woman who is helping to shape the Middle Eastern museum of tomorrow: Sheikha al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, sister of Qatars emir.  She is chairwoman of Qatar Museums, and oversees institutions including Dohas Museum of Islamic Art, which was designed by I.M. Pei and inaugurated in 2008.She and her team have also put on attention-grabbing shows by such artists as Takashi Murakami and Damien Hirst.In 2013, Mr. Hirst exhibited 14 giant bronze sculptures tracking a fetuss development from conception to birth  an unusual exhibit for a conservative society. The same year, a 15-foot-high outdoor sculpture of the soccer star Zinedine Zidane by the French-Algerian artist Adel Abdessemed was removed after sparking criticism for promoting violence. The sculpture referred to Zidanes World Cup head butt.Sheikha Mayassa, a speaker at the conference, was asked if she feared a backlash against her art choices. As a nation thats growing very quickly and embracing global culture and joining in the narrative of global art, its quite obvious for us to bring in contemporary artists, she replied. It doesnt mean that were trying to create controversial moments.The point was to inspire young artists, she said. Not everybody can travel around the world, but we can organize exhibitions from the world.Panel discussions were interspersed with visits to art displays and architectural sites. One was the opening of a sprawling exhibition of Chinese contemporary art curated by Cai Guo-Qiang, called What About the Art? Among the works on display was Freedom (2009), an installation by Sun Yuan and Peng Yu consisting of a huge fire hose jumping around in a transparent water-filled tank, emitting deafening sounds.Every artwork there, you could get lost in, the American artist Jeff Koons said at the conference, praising the abrasiveness and disruptive quality of the water hose work.Another panelist, the Dubai-based writer Sultan Sooud al-Qassemi, said, I would rather this money were spent on Middle Eastern artists.Mr. Qassemi, who set up the Barjeel Art Foundation in Sharjah to promote Arab artists, acknowledged that Qatar wanted to expose the local public to world art. But he said regional art deserved as much if not more help, because I feel like we need to safeguard our creativity, which is under threat.In the next year or two, Doha is expecting to inaugurate the National Museum of Qatar, designed by the French architect Jean Nouvel, who is also completing the Louvre Abu Dhabi. Mr. Nouvel gave a group of conference attendees a hard-hat tour of the site  its facade a cluster of slanted disks shaped like a desert rose, the crystal formations found in areas such as the Qatari desert.Another panelist, Deyan Sudjic, the director of Londons Design Museum, said in an earlier discussion on the building of museums that Its important to not use a museum as an alibi. You need to build a museum because you care about what its going to do and what its going to have in it.The new Qatar museum will contain objects relating to Qatari history and heritage, including archaeological finds and arts and crafts.Mr. Nouvel called for the contents to be expanded. Here in Doha, we are practically in a new city. If we look back 50 years, whats happened in terms of development is absolutely extraordinary, he said. The memory of this development has to be preserved, and thats the role of the National Museum of Qatar.Yet Qatar has a shortage of archives documenting the recent past, he noted. We absolutely have to find a way of telling the extraordinary story of a desert that has become a completely global urban hub, he said. How? Art is an exceptional instrument for that."}

Were at the point now where we want a fresh approach.The field has been narrowed to 20 architects, Mr. Wardropper said, and the Frick hopes to have a selection by the end of the year, with initial designs by 2017.While the Frick abandoned its earlier renovation plan, designed by Davis Brody Bond  which called for a six-story addition that eliminated the gated garden on East 70th Street  its space constraints have remained the same, if not become more pressing, Mr. Wardropper said, as evidenced by its current popular van Dyck exhibition.We need more facilities in order to mount a major show like that, without taking down the permanent collection to do it, Mr. Wardropper said. Were essentially a house thats been retrofitted as a museum and the flow of our visitors is something thats always been a problem."}
{"text": "While Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson filmed their 94th episode of Elementary, the CBS detective series, on the Upper East Side in Manhattan on Friday, a real-life homicide mystery took a new turn just one block away.The case has stymied New York City police detectives for more than a week now, after a 78-year-old man was found dead in his apartment on the top floor of a prewar apartment building on East 64th Street. The man, Christopher Cooley, was discovered on March 17, seated on a couch, his necktie looped, but not knotted, around his neck, a throw pillow over his face and a broken lamp at his feet, the police said. His hair was matted with blood.The police have not yet publicly declared the case a homicide, but in a brief interview on Friday, the citys chief medical examiner did just that, indicating that a cord of some sort had been used to strangle Mr. Cooley and that the case was not a suicide. The cause of death is ligature strangulation, and the manner of death, homicide, the medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, said. She declined to say what was used to kill him.The homicide has left many residents anxious at the thought of a killer on the loose and others annoyed at the sudden intrusion of detectives and reporters.Some have begun locking their doors, after years of keeping them unlocked and relying on doormen to keep them safe.So far, the case has yielded few clues. Mr. Cooley had long lived alone in his 11th-floor apartment. Younger neighbors knew Mr. Cooley, a Yale graduate, as little more than a friendly face in the elevator. He apparently did not regale neighbors with stories, although he clearly had some good ones.While living in Venice as a younger man, Mr. Cooley had gotten to know Ezra Pound, the poet who was indicted on a treason charge for his wartime support of Fascist Italy, and even attended the poets last birthday party, days before Pounds death, according to one book.Reached by telephone, a sister of Mr. Cooleys, Clare Cooley Edwards, declined to speak about his death.Mr. Cooleys frequent vacations were one reason his death went unnoticed for some time, a doorman, who gave his name as Alex, said in an interview. By the time he was found, newspapers dating to March 5 had piled up at his door. But Alex, speaking while on a cigarette break, said he and the other doormen had not suspected anything because Mr. Cooley often vacationed in Europe and didnt tell the building that he was leaving.The first person to worry about his absence was an out-of-state sister, who called the building after being unable to reach her brother, the police said. At the sisters request, the buildings superintendent opened Mr. Cooleys apartment through a back door. The tenant was found dead, the police said.The superintendent quickly called the police, and officers discovered no signs of a break-in or robbery. The door to Mr. Cooleys apartment was locked, the police said, and $190 cash was found in his pockets."}
{"text": "PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla.   Ruben Tejada ranged over to field a high-bouncing ground ball, but he took his eye off the ball for an instant, and it bounced around his glove. Rather than boo, some Mets fans at Tradition Field chuckled.After spending his entire career with the Mets, Tejada was playing his first game with the St. Louis Cardinals.In a span of a few years he was deemed the Mets shortstop of the future, criticized for his poor work ethic, benched, demoted and then celebrated as a fan favorite after he hung in on a double-play attempt during the 2015 playoffs and had his leg broken by the Los Angeles Dodgers Chase Utley.The Mets released Tejada during spring training when it appeared he would not be playing much behind the veterans the Mets had acquired this winter. Tejada promptly signed with the Cardinals.I turned the page to another history, another chance, another day, Tejada, dressed head to toe in Cardinals red, said Friday. Thats why I stay happy and stay the same, stay focused.For Tejada to land with the Cardinals was a stroke of luck. Their regular starting shortstop, Jhonny Peralta, sustained a broken thumb this spring and is expected to be out for at least half the season.With his athleticism and my athleticism, we can kind of make some fun things happen, second baseman Kolten Wong said of Tejada. Im excited to see how we mesh together.In an odd coincidence, since Tejada signed a one-year deal with the Cardinals about a week ago, the Mets have not won a single spring training game. They have lost seven consecutive games, including both of their split-squad games on Thursday.And when Jeurys Familia blew a two-run ninth-inning lead on Friday, the game ended in a 5-5 tie, and the Curse of Ruben Tejada seemed to be gaining steam.Noah Syndergaard had pitched a gem, striking out nine batters and holding the Cardinals to two runs in six innings; his spring training E.R.A. is 2.04.Matt Reynolds drove in three runs, and, playing at first base, Wilmer Flores had two hits and scored two runs.When Familia entered the game, his sinker lacked its signature movement. Familia allowed four consecutive hits, which tied the game, and then intentionally walked the bases loaded, hoping for a double-play ball, only to walk home the go-ahead run. It was the second time this spring that Familia had pitched on back-to-back days.Ive seen it in the past, Manager Terry Collins said, where guys whove accumulated a lot of work and a lot of innings, like last year, it takes a little while for their arms to bounce back.As long as hes healthy, as long as he feels good, hell get there.Told about Collinss comments, Familia said: Everythings good, man. My arms 100 percent."}
{"text": "PHILADELPHIA  It might well be the most fearsome college basketball team in the country, but in the vulnerable moments before tipoff, North Carolina relies on a routine of flying elbows and gyroscopic hips.The Tar Heels like to dance. In the tunnel, they form their huddle and turn it into an impromptu dance-off, with two players twirling in the center and the rest clapping and laughing.We try to stay loose, the sophomore forward Justin Jackson said.They were loose on Friday night, hailing points against fifth-seeded Indiana at Wells Fargo Center in a statement game. The first half approached flawlessness. The second left no doubt, ending with a 101-86 win.North Carolina, the top seed in the N.C.A.A. tournaments East Regional, will face Notre Dame on Sunday in the Tar Heels first regional final appearance since 2012. Marcus Paige led the Tar Heels with 21 points, while Brice Johnson added 20 and Kennedy Meeks had 15.Paiges six 3-pointers tied North Carolinas team record for the most in an N.C.A.A. tournament game.When we knock down shots, were tough, he said.Indiana Coach Tom Crean agreed.If they play like that, even remotely close to that, then theyre going to be very, very hard to beat, he said.The pregame talk was heavy on history because these two programs had made a lot of it. Indiana and North Carolina are among the sports titans.Each owns five national titles, and they have 26 Final Four appearances between them, so it seemed a bit strange that such iconic programs had met only 13 times before. Their last meeting was in another N.C.A.A. tournament regional semifinal, in 1984, the last collegiate game for Michael Jordan. The Hoosiers won, just as they had done three years earlier, in a national title game played in Philadelphia.Still, much of the history was lost on the millennials who were playing Friday night.Ten years ago my guys thought Michael Jordan invented the game, North Carolinas coach, Roy Williams, joked on Thursday. Now they dont even know who Michael Jordan is, if it werent for the Hanes commercials.North Carolina attacked the paint on almost every possession, putting the ball in the wide hands of Meeks, Johnson and Isaiah Hicks. In the second half, the Tar Heels quickly put Indiana in foul trouble. The Hoosiers picked up eight fouls in the first five minutes.Success for Indiana is all relative, but the Hoosier faithful was undoubtedly antsy this past fall for more N.C.A.A. tournament success, given that the team had tumbled out of the tournament in the first round last season after missing it altogether in 2014. There was pressure on Crean to redirect a program that had dealt with several disconcerting off-court problems. And when the team lost by 20 at Duke on Dec. 2, its third loss in five games, the chorus of critics grew louder still.Looking back, Crean considered the Duke game a watershed moment for the team. The Hoosiers won the next 12 in a row en route to claiming a 13th Big Ten title.What we learned from that game was we need to be more aggressive, Crean said Thursday.On Friday, Indiana played without Robert Johnson, the teams fifth-leading scorer, who has an ankle injury. But it is hard to know how Johnson could have helped against North Carolinas shooters, who came out blazing from far away. The team that likes to play in the paint drained its first seven 3-point attempts.No one was hotter than Paige, who scored 12 of North Carolinas first 14 points in the opening minutes by going 4 for 4 from 3-point range. With Paiges torrid start, the Tar Heels shot 62.1 percent from the field in the first half, taking a 52-41 lead into the break.When youve got guys like that with a team like North Carolina, its a tough train to stop, Indianas Max Bielfeldt said.Indiana, trying to reach its first regional final since 2002, struggled to contend with North Carolinas size and athleticism. Indiana is an excellent 3-point shooting team, but the Hoosiers opened just 4 of 12 from deep. Meanwhile, North Carolinas many weapons wore down Indianas defense.Five players scored in double figures, and the Tar Heels finished with 11 3-pointers and never ceded the lead.As a result, they have a chance to write more history."}
{"text": "JERUSALEM   The Israeli military said on Friday that a soldier who shot a Palestinian assailant in the head as he lay motionless on the ground was being investigated on suspicion of murder. The announcement was highly unusual and underscored the seriousness of the case, which was filmed and quickly spread over social media.An additional three officers  a company commander and two platoon commanders  were reprimanded because they did not treat the wounded man,Yusri al-Sharif, 21, after the confrontation on Thursday, said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an army spokesman.Palestinians said the episode was unusual only because it had been filmed and had generated outrage. They said that since a surge of attacks began in October, there had been several similar episodes in which assailants were shot dead even after they did not pose a threat, and in which wounded Palestinians were left untreated.Palestinians have killed about 30 Israelis, two Americans and a Palestinian bystander since the near-daily stabbings, shootings and vehicular attacks began last fall. Israeli forces or civilians have shot dead 180 Palestinians during the same period. Most were either attempting attacks or were suspected of doing so.Thursdays clash began when two Palestinian men stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier at a checkpoint near a Jewish settlement enclave in the West Bank city of Hebron. Both were shot.Video then emerged showing a soldier cocking his rifle and shooting Mr. Sharif for a second time as he lay on the road, as other soldiers and an Israeli ambulance crew milled about. The Israeli military swiftly condemned the episode as a grave breach of its values, and detained the soldier.The soldiers lawyers say he acted appropriately, because Mr. Sharif still had the intention and ability to harm soldiers.The announcement that the soldier was being investigated on suspicion of murder came after a court hearing on Friday to extend his detention by four days. The court barred the publication of the soldiers identity.It is unusual, Colonel Lerner said of the case. It goes to show the severity of the issue from the outset.Colonel Lerner said he could not recall the last time a soldier had been investigated on suspicion of murder, nor the last time a soldier had been charged with murder.Sarit Michaeli, a spokeswoman for BTselem, a human rights organization based in Israel, noted an investigation would not necessarily lead to a murder charge, which in Israel must cross a high threshold. Ms. Michaeli said a murder charge would be even more unlikely in a system that Israeli rights groups say is lenient on soldiers.As an example, another Israeli rights group, Yesh Din, reported that of 33 investigations the military opened in the West Bank into the deaths of Palestinians in 2014, only one indictment was issued, for manslaughter. Neither Yesh Din nor Colonel Lerner could say if a murder charge was considered in any of those 33 cases."}
{"text": "Real-estate reality shows seem to have reached some kind of parody tipping point. Theyre Watching, a mildly amusing horror movie released on Friday, is about a reality TV crew that goes to Moldova to film an expatriates fixer-upper story and stumbles into the occult. But if you want to see this annoying genre lampooned especially mercilessly, the caustic new Bajillion Dollar Propertie$, on the Seeso streaming service, is the destination for you.The series, which had its premiere last week and offers a new episode each Thursday, is shot in the gushy, irritating style of all those reality shows that feature real estate agents and their customers fawning over bathroom fixtures and wine cellars. The agents of this (fake) Beverly Hills real estate firm are noteworthy mostly for their incompetence, and their potential clients are straight out of the Realtors Worst Nightmares Handbook.The agents include Victoria King (Mandell Maughan), a slick dresser with a ruthless streak; Amir Yaghoob (Dan Ahdoot), whose best skill is sycophancy; and  go ahead, say the name out loud  Chelsea Leight-Leigh (Tawny Newsome), whos addicted to social media. Funniest and ickiest of all are Baxter Reynolds (Drew Tarver) and Andrew Wright (Ryan Gaul), who work as a team and are way too close for two guys who, they assert, are not gay lovers. A new office manager (Tim Baltz) only magnifies the ineptitude around him.In the opening episode, the firms founder (Paul F. Tompkins) dropped a bombshell: He was planning to name a partner, which set the agents into a frenzied competition to land clients and score Brownie points. The client-landing part is complicated by the fact that the customers these agents find  buyers and sellers  tend to have odd ideas and habits. A potential seller wants to part with only certain rooms in his house. A buyer claiming to be a dentist shows up with far more semiautomatic weapons than a dentist needs.Well-chosen guest stars turn up in every episode, none funnier (so far) than Jason Mantzoukas, who in Episode 2 plays a pretentious photographer hired to take new portraits of everyone to spice up the firms website. Victoria was a little put off when he started sniffing her.I have to change the settings based on smell, he explained, adjusting his camera. When people look at this picture, theyre not just going to see you, theyre going to smell you.Seeso, a comedy streaming service that NBC began in January, needs some sharp original programming to stand out in a crowded landscape. This addictively ribald series will help."}
{"text": "Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice has been ripped apart by critics. The movie had sunk to a 31 percent on Rotten Tomatoes as of this writing, joining other critically disparaged superhero films like the Fantastic Four reboot of 2015 (9 percent) and Green Lantern, from 2011 (26 percent).One critic said moviegoers would leave feeling drained and depressed. Another called it the least compelling franchise come-on since The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The Times critic A.O. Scott wrote that the film was about as diverting as having a porcelain sink broken over your head.It remains to be seen whether fans will be convinced that the clash between DC Comics mightiest heroes is a spectacle worth skipping. Critics who have panned the film have been met with fury online, with angry fans sneering at their reviews, their writing and even their motives.Some experts have speculated that the superhero movie is nearing the end of its dominance in theaters, but other films of the genre still retain appeal for moviegoers. Just last month, Deadpool took in a record $135 million in North American theaters during its opening weekend, the biggest domestic opening for an R-rated movie.But Deadpool was a triumph of budget filmmaking, costing 20th Century Fox only $58 million, garnering positive reviews and taking plenty of potshots at its own genre. With an estimated production budget of $250 million, Batman v Superman was significantly more expensive for Warner Bros. (which owns DC Comics).Neither Fantastic Four nor Green Lantern was able to escape reviewers indictments. Of course, icons like Batman and Superman carry more weight with comics fans than the lesser heroes featured in those films.Shawn Robbins, a senior analyst at BoxOffice.com, predicted that die-hard fans would not be dissuaded by negative reviews of the latest superhero mash-up.Those fans have waited decades to see Batman and Superman together on the big screen, he wrote in an email. Even in the age of social media and Rotten Tomatoes watchers, thats the kind of loyal anticipation that isnt easily nullified.But Mr. Robbins said that others less devoted to the caped crusader and the big blue boy scout might be deterred by bad reviews. Even if the film proves to be critic-proof this opening weekend, he said, there are concerns about the films long-term staying power at the box office.Even before the reviews emerged, Batman v Superman had already attracted strong interest from fans. According to the ticketing site Fandango, the movie sold more tickets before its release than any other superhero movie in the sites history, beating out The Dark Knight Rises, from 2012, and Avengers: Age of Ultron, from 2015. And fans who had seen the movie were far more pleased with it than critics, giving it a 79 percent on Rotten Tomatoes.Those same fans are likely to turn out for next months Captain America: Civil War, another film that features an epic face-off between heroes, this one involving Captain America and Iron Man.Deadline, a movie website, reported that Batman v Superman was predicted to make $350 million globally in its opening weekend, though it acknowledged that bad reviews could hurt its numbers domestically. According to Variety, the film is also expected to do well in China, the worlds second-largest film market, though not quite as well as recent blockbusters like Fast and Furious 7.If the bad reviews do limit the films appeal at the domestic box office, it could implicate the married couple serving as the shepherds of DCs cinematic universe, Zack and Deborah Snyder. The director and producer of Batman v Superman are set to take on the same roles in two coming Justice League films. They are both involved in the production of a Wonder Woman spinoff, this summers Suicide Squad and a gang of other DC titles.Mr. Robbins said that if fans reviews of Batman v Superman match those of critics, the Snyders control over the franchise could be jeopardized.Zack Snyder hasnt gotten to this point in his career without building a fan base of his own, he wrote. But it is difficult to imagine the studio not rethinking its creative strategy for DC films if moviegoer word of mouth lines up with the critics opinions on Batman v Superman."}
{"text": "RYE BROOK, N.Y.  The United States has many colossal dams, hydroelectric power generators like Hoover and Grand Coulee so monumental in scale and purpose that they have been celebrated in song by Woody Guthrie and others.The Bowman Avenue Dam in this low-key suburban village in Westchester County is not one of those. Its opening is about the width of a modest living room, and the 20-foot-tall dam itself essentially keeps a babbling creek, the Blind Brook, from flooding basements and ground floors in houses downstream.Yet, according to the authorities, it was the computer-guided controls of this dam that seven Iranian computer hackers chose to penetrate on behalf of that countrys Revolutionary Guards Corps, as part of a plot that also breached or paralyzed 46 of the nations largest financial institutions and blocked hundreds of thousands of customers from accessing their bank accounts online. The cyberattacks were disclosed in an indictment that Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch announced on Thursday.Its ridiculous how little that dam is, how insignificant in the grand scheme of things, said Paul Rosenberg, the villages mayor. Were not talking about something vital to the infrastructure of the country.The mayor, despite being puzzled by Rye Brooks role in the alleged plot, had several theories about why the villages sluice-gate dam had been singled out. One was that the Iranian hackers had confused the structure with another named Bowman  the Arthur R. Bowman Dam on the Crooked River in Oregon, which is 245 feet tall and 800 feet long, and is used to irrigate a large swath of local farms.Mayor Rosenberg also speculated that the hackers had gone after the Rye Brook dam in a dry run for a more disruptive invasion of, say, a major hydroelectric generator or some other grand and indispensable element of the nations power grid.Any attempt to remotely manipulate the Bowman Avenue dam would have failed because it was under repair and offline at the time that the authorities say the Iranians were trying to take it over. American investigators were nevertheless disturbed because the attempt indicated that hackers could take control of computer-operated infrastructure.Despite being unsung, the dam  which is less than 15 miles north of the Bronx and is in a thicket of brush and boulders near Interstate 287, a shopping center, a local middle school and hundreds of homes  has a history dating to the early 1900s. In those pre-refrigeration days, what is now the Upper Pond was used to produce ice; there was a quarry, since closed, on what is now the Lower Pond.In 1941, according to a 2008 engineering study, the dam collapsed and was rebuilt on the brooks ledge rocks as a reinforced concrete dam with a fixed timber door. While the door kept the waters of the Blind Brook at bay and flowing gently toward Long Island Sound, it did not prevent high water from spilling over the dam during major storms like Hurricane Agnes in June 1972 and Hurricane Eloise in September 1975. Homes, yards and streets were sometimes badly damaged.On April 15, 2007, a once-in-a-century noreaster pummeled the Westchester County seaboard with eight inches of rain in a 24-hour period. Low-lying portions of towns like Mamaroneck and Rye were particularly hard hit. Indian Village, a Rye neighborhood with more than 200 residents where the streets are named for Indian tribes and 3,000- to 5,500-square-foot homes sell for over $1 million, was severely damaged, Mr. Rosenberg said.The 2008 study, by the Charles H. Sells Inc. engineering firm in Briarcliff Manor, showed that Indian Village had filed 113 of the 273 claims for insurance losses in the City of Rye caused by the storm. (The city is a separate municipality from the town of Rye, which includes two villages, Rye Brook and Port Chester.) Officials of Rye Brook and the City of Rye, which owns the dam, decided after conducting flood-mitigation studies to build a sluice gate that could be raised or lowered depending on the volume of water flowing.Costing $2 million and containing an orifice 15-feet wide by 2.5-feet high, the sluice gate began operation in 2013. Its computer program processes a complicated array of data sent by sensors in the brook that measure, among other things, water levels and temperature, and then adjusts flow rates accordingly. It was that computer program, which Mr. Rosenberg said was accessible through a cellular modem, that had been penetrated. The indictment identified the key Iranian involved in the breach as Hamid Firoozi, 34, employed by two Iranian companies sponsored by the Revolutionary Guards.Mr. Rosenberg said he and other local officials learned of the intrusion in 2013 but were asked not to discuss it.They tried to get into it, Mr. Rosenberg said of the hackers, but they did not activate the sluice gate. Still, he said, we have to be cognizant of what infrastructure gets hooked up to the Internet."}
{"text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon   One admirer of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria compared him to Charles de Gaulle, the French leader stubborn and confident enough to defy a more powerful ally, the United States, even after its decisive help against Nazi Germany.His critics offer another analogy: the fable of the scorpion that persuades a frog to carry it across the river, then stings it, drowning both. Russia, having rescued Mr. Assad with its air force, is the frog. Now it is swimming for a political settlement to the Syrian war, hoping to cement its renewed status as a global power  but given Mr. Assads history, he may very well sink the negotiations and explain, as several diplomats put it, that making deals is not in his nature.Ever since President Vladimir V. Putins surprise announcement last week that Russia was scaling back its aerial bombing campaign in Syria, speculation has swirled about whether Mr. Putins next move is to force Mr. Assad to make a substantive political compromise to end the war.But while Mr. Assads dependence on Russias military, money and political influence has only grown during Mr. Putins six-month aerial assault in Syria, the campaign has also bolstered Mr. Assads confidence and ambitions as it has shored up Syrian government forces.Putin apparently thinks Syria needs Russia more than the other way around, said David W. Lesch, an Assad biographer and professor at Trinity University in San Antonio. But Assad and his inner circle probably arrogantly think it is quite the reverse.Mr. Assad inherited the presidency in 2000 from his father, who governed for 30 years. He relies on a small, cohesive ruling coterie, mostly members of his family and security officials. While Mr. Putins withdrawal appeared to take Syrian officials briefly by surprise, they quickly told diplomats that Russian support was undiminished and dismissed any notion that they were under pressure.Bushra Khalil, a Lebanese lawyer who has longstanding contacts with Syrian government insiders and has met several times in recent weeks with senior officials, including the interior minister and a powerful intelligence chief, Ali Mamlouk, described their mood as buoyant.Mr. Assads advisers believe not only that he has passed the risky period and will remain the president of Syria, she said in a recent interview, but also that his ability to stand up to the whole world will make him more prominent than ever as a leader in the region.They insist that Russia is steadfast, she added, but they also hold an insurance card: their even closer relationship with Iran and their ability to juggle two very different allies.They are like a man with two wives, said Ms. Khalil, best known for defending Saddam Hussein in his war crimes trial in Iraq. There is something you like in each one.Ms. Khalil, who compared Mr. Assad to de Gaulle, is a longtime supporter of his, with a flair for flamboyant statements, and her meetings with officials were not about the war but about a court case involving a son of Muammar el-Qaddafi, the deposed Libyan dictator.But her description of the inner circles mood and modus operandi was echoed by many others, both supporters and detractors, who have met with Mr. Assad or his advisers and allies in recent months. They include scholars, humanitarian officials, Syrian associates, diplomats and officials with the pro-government alliance that includes Iran, Russia and Hezbollah. Most of them spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to preserve their access to government officials or to avoid reprisals.Over and over again in separate interviews, these people described a leadership that is expert in playing allies off one another; often refuses compromise, even when the chips appear to be down; and, if forced to make deals, delays and complicates them, playing for time until Mr. Assads situation improves.Mr. Putin seems bent on capping a triumphant return to the world stage by presiding over a political solution for Syria, hand in hand with the United States. Several diplomats said that Russia defined victory as a negotiated solution that would leave Mr. Assad in power  showing that Western aspirations for regime change had failed  but that Mr. Putin might back a deal that would ease the Syrian leader out later or diminish his power.While Iran appears more attached to keeping Mr. Assad in power, it is becoming clear that without Russian air power, Iranian support is not enough to help Syrian government forces advance, despite thousands of ground troops from Hezbollah and other Iran-backed militias.So Mr. Assad most likely realizes that he has to engage in some kind of political process, at least to satisfy Mr. Putin, said Mr. Lesch, the biographer, who regularly visited Mr. Assad from 2004 to 2009 and has met with high-level Syrian government officials and opposition members since the civil war started in 2011.But the Syrian government could drag out and complicate the process, Mr. Lesch said, and say no 49 times until saying yes on the 50th. He added that Mr. Assad probably figures he can game the system in a way that preserves the existing core in power.Another problem, analysts say, is that Mr. Assad and his father before him deliberately created a system dependent on a single leader, without strong institutions or deputies. Some believe it is so brittle that even the slightest compromise is likely to bring it down  the assessment that led Mr. Assad to crack down on protesters rather than accede to political changes in the first place.Mr. Assad has proved to be the ultimate survivor. He has held on through five years of upheaval, beginning with political protests that seemed to have the momentum of a widespread Arab revolt and American support, and devolving into a proxy war that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced half of Syrias population.His opponents, domestic and international, have time and again underestimated not just Mr. Assads readiness to use violence to preserve his authority, but also the staying power of his inner circle and core loyalist forces.Mohammad al-Shaar, the interior minister, sleeps in a paper-stacked office, still working long hours despite three attempts on his life  a poisoning and two bombs, one of which damaged his right hand  said Ms. Khalil, a longtime friend.Mr. Assads brother-in-law, Asef Shawkat, died in a bombing in 2012 along with three other top security officials; Mr. Assads brother Maher was maimed but remained a powerful general. Yet Mr. Assad still holds meetings in his ceremonial palace overlooking Damascus with only minimal visible security, leading several recent visitors to joke that they could have walked in with a gun.Opponents also miscalculated the willingness of a critical mass of ordinary Syrians, including many who dislike Mr. Assad, to remain quiescent for fear of uncertain alternatives.Mr. Assad excels at running the clock. His officials show up at peace talks but essentially refuse to negotiate. They broadly promise humanitarian aid access while denying the vast majority of specific requests. Mr. Assad agreed in 2013, under threat of United States military action, to destroy Syrias arsenal of chemical weapons, yet conventional attacks on civilian areas, and accusations of chlorine gas use, remain routine.As time passes, the rise of the Islamic State and the refugee crisis spilling into Europe have shifted Western priorities away from Mr. Assads ouster. Washington no longer insists he step down at the beginning of a transition.Mr. Assad and his allies believe that the West has concluded it needs him to control Syrias borders to fight the Islamic State and stem the flow of refugees, said an official with the pro-government alliance.Those who support Mr. Assad are counting, in part, on the fractured nature of the conflict, saying they do not believe Russia will be able to find a set of opposition figures who are both willing to share power with Mr. Assad and are acceptable to all parties.At the same time, Mr. Assad and his circle often test the patience of badly needed allies, according to a Syrian who, while deeply critical of the president, supports the government over the opposition. This Syrian, who speaks often with officials, said the government had tangled with Iran over bills, with Hezbollah over turf and with Russia over military performance.That is nothing new. A diplomat with long experience in the region recounted that in the 1980s, a British diplomat asked the Soviet ambassador about the superpowers relationship with Mr. Assads father, Hafez.They take everything from us, the Soviet said, except advice.Many Syrian officials, steeped in Arab nationalism and often educated in Moscow, feel comfortable with a secular Russia and its emphasis on preserving state institutions. But many also value a theocratic Iran for its commitment to a long fight in Syria and its confrontational policy toward Israel.Several prominent pro-Assad insiders have also sought to woo the United States. But a Western scholar and former official who met Mr. Assad and his advisers last spring said the Syrians demonstrated unrealistic hopes and had failed to grasp how brutal they appeared to Washington.But Western officials who hoped for a split inside the inner circle were also unrealistic, this scholar said. Russias aid has now most likely squelched any fears for their personal fate that could have tempted Mr. Assads closest confidants to leave.Mr. Lesch, the biographer, said that some advisers believed some decentralization of authority was needed, but that it remained to be seen if they can form a critical mass to convince Assad to negotiate seriously."}
{"text": "BRUSSELS  As a dragnet aimed at Islamic State operatives spiraled across Brussels and into at least five European countries on Friday, the authorities were also focusing on a narrower but increasingly alarming threat: the vulnerability of Belgiums nuclear installations.The investigation into this weeks deadly attacks in Brussels has prompted worries that the Islamic State is seeking to attack, infiltrate or sabotage nuclear installations or obtain nuclear or radioactive material. This is especially worrying in a country with a history of security lapses at its nuclear facilities, a weak intelligence apparatus and a deeply rooted terrorist network.On Friday, the authorities stripped security badges from several workers at one of two plants where all nonessential employees had been sent home hours after the attacks at the Brussels airport and one of the citys busiest subway stations three days earlier. Video footage of a top official at another Belgian nuclear facility was discovered last year in the apartment of a suspected militant linked to the extremists who unleashed the horror in Paris in November.Asked on Thursday at a London think tank whether there was a danger of the Islamic States obtaining a nuclear weapon, the British defense secretary, Michael Fallon, said that was a new and emerging threat.While the prospect that terrorists can obtain enough highly enriched uranium and then turn it into a nuclear fission bomb seems far-fetched to many experts, they say the fabrication of some kind of dirty bomb from radioactive waste or byproducts is more conceivable. There are a variety of other risks involving Belgiums facilities, including that terrorists somehow shut down the privately operated plants, which provide nearly half of Belgiums power.The fears at the nuclear power plants are of an accident in which someone explodes a bomb inside the plant, said Sbastien Berg, the spokesman for Belgiums federal agency for nuclear control. The other danger is that they fly something into the plant from outside. That could stop the cooling process of the used fuel, Mr. Berg explained, and in turn shut down the plant.The revelation of the video surveillance footage was the first evidence that the Islamic State has a focused interest in nuclear material. But Belgiums nuclear facilities have long had a worrying track record of breaches, prompting warnings from Washington and other foreign capitals.Some of these are relatively minor: The Belgian nuclear agencys computer system was hacked this year and shut down briefly. In 2013, two individuals managed to scale the fence at Belgiums research reactor in the city of Mol, break into a laboratory and steal equipment.Others are far more disconcerting. In 2012, two employees at the nuclear plant in Doel quit to join jihadists in Syria, and eventually transferred their allegiances to the Islamic State. Both men fought in a brigade that included dozens of Belgians, including Abdelhamid Abaaoud, considered the on-the-ground leader of the Paris attacks.One of these men is believed to have died fighting in Syria, but the other was convicted of terror-related offenses in Belgium in 2014, and released from prison last year, according to Pieter Van Oestaeyen, a researcher who tracks Belgiums jihadist networks. It is not known whether they communicated information about their former workplace to their Islamic State comrades.At the same plant where these jihadists once worked, an individual who has yet to be identified walked into the reactor No. 4 in 2014, turned a valve and drained 65,000 liters of oil used to lubricate the turbines. The ensuing friction nearly overheated the machinery, forcing it to be shut down. The damage was so severe that the reactor was out of commission for five months.Investigators are now looking into possible links between that case and terrorist groups, although they caution that it could also have been the work of an insider with a workplace grudge. What is clear is that the act was meant to sow dangerous havoc  and that the plants security systems can be breached.This was a deliberate act to take down the nuclear reactor, and a very good way to do it, Mr. Berg, the nuclear agency spokesman, said of the episode in a recent interview.These incidents are now all being seen in a new light, as information is mounting from investigators that the terrorist network that hit Paris and Brussels may have been in the planning stages of some kind of operation at a Belgian nuclear facility.Three men linked to the surveillance video were involved in either the Paris or the Brussels attacks.Ibrahim and Khalid el-Bakraoui, the brothers who the authorities say were suicide bombers at the Brussels airport and subway station, are believed to have driven to the surveilled scientists home and removed a camera that was hidden in nearby bushes. The authorities believe they then took it to a house connected to Mohammed Bakkali, who was arrested by the Belgian police after the Paris attacks and is accused of helping with logistics and planning. The police found the videocamera during a raid on the house.Belgium has both low-enriched uranium, which fuels its two power plants, and highly enriched uranium, which is used in its research reactor primarily to make medical isotopes, plus the byproducts of that process. The United States provides Belgium with highly enriched uranium  making it particularly concerned about radioactive materials landing in terrorist hands  and then buys isotopes.Experts say the most remote of the potential nuclear-related risks is that Islamic State operatives would be able to obtain highly enriched uranium. Even the danger of a dirty bomb is limited, they said, because much radioactive waste is so toxic it would likely sicken or kill the people trying to steal it.Cheryl Rofer, a retired nuclear scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and editor of the blog Nuclear Diner, said Belgiums Tihange nuclear plant has pressurized water reactors, inside a heavy steel vessel, reducing the danger that nuclear fuel could leak or spread. She said that the Brussels bombers explosive of choice, TATP, might be able to damage parts of the plant but that the damage would shut down the reactor, limiting the radiation damage.And if terrorists did manage to shut down the reactor and reach the fuel rods, they would have to remove them with a crane to get the fuel out of them, Ms. Rofer said. And then the fuel would still be too radioactive to go near  it would kill you quickly.While experts are doubtful that terrorists could steal the highly enriched uranium at the Mol reactor without alerting law enforcement, some nuclear scientists do believe that if they could obtain it, they could recruit people who know how to fashion a primitive nuclear device.Matthew Bunn, a specialist in nuclear security at Harvards John F. Kennedy School of Government, said another worry was the byproducts of the isotopes made at Mol, such as Cesium-137.Its like talcum powder, he said. If you made a dirty bomb out of it, its going to provoke fear, you would have to evacuate and you have to spend a lot of money cleaning it up; the economic destruction cost could be very high.The discovery of the surveillance video in November set off alarm bells across the small nuclear-security community, with fresh worries that terror groups could kidnap, extort or otherwise coerce a nuclear scientist into helping them. The official whose family was watched works at Mol, one of five research reactors worldwide that produce 90 percent of the radio isotopes used for medical diagnosis and treatment.Professor Bunn of Harvard noted that the Islamic State has an apocalyptic ideology and believes there is going to be a final war with the United States, expects to win that war and would need very powerful weapons to do so.And if they ever did turn to nuclear weapons, he added, they have more people, more money and more territory under their control and more ability to recruit experts globally than Al Qaeda at its best ever had."}
{"text": "BEIRUT, Lebanon  After days of raging battles with Islamic State militants, Syrian Army units and allied government militias backed by intensive Russian airstrikes on Friday recaptured the strategically important citadel in Palmyra, Syrian state television reported, citing a military source.The army has been edging closer to Palmyra as its units continue fighting ISIS terrorists in the vicinity of the ancient city establishing control over Palmyra Castle after inflicting heavy losses on ISIS terrorists, said the state news agency, SANA.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based monitoring group, confirmed the reports, noting that the government forces had reached the ancient castle with the help of Russian special forces and Al Fatimiyen, a brigade made up of Afghans who were living in Iran.Some opposition activists were dubious of the reports from government-dominated news media. Nothing proves they took the castle yet, said Khaled al-Homsi, a Palmyra native who is an anti-government activist related to an archaeology expert and former official who was killed by the Islamic State when it overran the city.He added that if the reports proved to be true, then the government almost certainly will have retaken the city. If the regime forces reached the citadel, which overlooks the whole city, that means that Palmyra is under the regimes control.Another activist, Bebars al-Talawy, who communicates with contacts in the Islamic States media offices via Skype, said that ISIS forces now are pulling out all their equipment from the city and planting land mines everywhere.A government soldier reached in Palmyra sent a text message from the battlefield saying, We recaptured the citadel two days ago but delayed the announcement until we dismantle the land mines.He added, We will declare Palmyra a safe city in the upcoming days, and hopefully you can visit the place soon."}
{"text": "A Navy tugboat that disappeared after it sailed from San Francisco in 1921 has been found by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researchers in shark-infested waters about 30 miles west of San Francisco, putting an end to a 95-year-old mystery.The tugboat, the U.S.S. Conestoga, left California with 56 officers and crew members on board, bound for Tutuila, American Samoa, by way of Hawaii. When the ship failed to arrive, the Navy carried out an expansive air and sea search, but only a battered lifeboat with the letter C on its bow was ever found, hundreds of miles off the expected course.The whereabouts of the ship had since been one of the Navys greatest puzzles, but on Wednesday the N.O.A.A. and the Navy announced the mystery solved.In 2009, the N.O.A.A. Office of Coast Survey spotted an uncharted shipwreck near the Farallon Islands, a forbidding cluster of sharp rocks known for shipwrecks and a large population of great white sharks. Video from an investigation in 2015 using remotely operated vehicles shows the shipwreck under nearly 200 feet of water, encrusted in rust but largely intact, festooned with colorful sea anemones, rockfish and eels.Using the video, the N.O.A.A. and Navy researchers confirmed that the wrecks distinctive propeller and deck-mounted gun matched the long-lost tugboat.After nearly a century of ambiguity and a profound sense of loss, the Conestogas disappearance no longer is a mystery, Manson Brown, a deputy N.O.A.A. administrator, said in a statement.Weather logs indicate that soon after leaving California, the tugboat hit high winds and rough seas. A garbled radio transmission relayed later by another ship stated that the tug was battling a storm and that the barge she was towing had been torn adrift by heavy seas.Researchers said they believed that the boat had sunk as the crew members tried to reach a protected cove on the Farallons.This would have been a desperate act, as the approach is difficult, the N.O.A.A. report on the discovery noted. However, as Conestoga was in trouble and filling with water, it seemingly was the only choice to make.The exact location of the wreckage was not announced, to prevent unauthorized diving or looting, the agency said."}
{"text": "SAN FRANCISCO  The resounding win by a Google artificial intelligence program over a champion in the complex board game Go this month was a statement  not so much to professional game players as to Googles competitors.Many of the tech industrys biggest companies, like Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft, are jockeying to become the go-to company for A.I. In the industrys lingo, the companies are engaged in a platform war.A platform, in technology, is essentially a piece of software that other companies build on and that consumers cannot do without. Become the platform and huge profits will follow. Microsoft dominated personal computers because its Windows software became the center of the consumer software world. Google has come to dominate the Internet through its ubiquitous search bar.If true believers in A.I. are correct that this long-promised technology is ready for the mainstream, the company that controls A.I. could steer the tech industry for years to come.Whoever wins this race will dominate the next stage of the information age, said Pedro Domingos, a machine learning specialist and the author of The Master Algorithm, a 2015 book that contends that A.I. and big-data technology will remake the world.In this fight  no doubt in its early stages  the big tech companies are engaged in tit-for-tat publicity stunts, circling the same start-ups that could provide the technology pieces they are missing and, perhaps most important, trying to hire the same brains.Fei-Fei Li, a Stanford University professor who is an expert in computer vision, said one of her Ph.D. candidates had an offer for a job paying more than $1 million a year, and that was only one of four from big and small companies. On the candidates list, one of the biggest technology companies was ranked lowest, in terms of both money and excitement, she noted dryly.At the University of Toronto, IBM pursued a start-up called Ross Intelligence that makes a smart legal assistant, and extended a free offer to use its A.I. software, called Watson. For IBM, the financial payoff would come if start-ups like Ross generated sales, followed by a revenue-sharing arrangement. No upfront costs at all, said Andrew Arruda, chief executive of the start-up, which moved last year to Silicon Valley.For years, tech companies have used man-versus-machine competitions to show they are making progress on A.I. In 1997, an IBM computer beat the chess champion Garry Kasparov. Five years ago, IBM went even further when its Watson system won a three-day match on the television trivia show Jeopardy! Today, Watson is the centerpiece of IBMs A.I. efforts.Now, Googles A.I. program is drawing additional attention and pointing to a consolidation among techs biggest companies.By 2020, the market for machine learning applications will reach $40 billion, IDC, a market research firm, estimates. And 60 percent of those applications, the firm predicts, will run on the platform software of four companies  Amazon, Google, IBM and Microsoft.In January, before the Google softwares latest Go victory, the scientific journal Nature published an article describing how the program had beaten a European Go champion in five consecutive matches, overshadowing an effort by another tech giant, Facebook, to promote its own powerful Go-playing A.I. software. Googles software went on to beat the Go grandmaster Lee Se-dol 4-1 in South Korea this month.IBM is making the broadest entry into A.I. Its Watson unit, set up as a separate division in early 2014, is both a software and a services business, with technology tailored to specific industries. More than 80,000 developers have downloaded and tried out the software, and the Watson division has 500 industry partners, including big companies and start-ups.Its early days, but the long-term goal is to have hundreds of millions of people use Watson as self-service A.I., said David Kenny, general manager of the Watson division.In 2015, Amazon and Microsoft both added machine learning capabilities to their cloud software platforms, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. The companies are using machine learning software to help customers spot patterns and make predictions in vast amounts of data.Microsoft offers 18 machine learning services, including face recognition, text analysis and product recommendations. More A.I. capabilities, analysts say, should be announced at the end of the month, when Microsoft hosts a large conference for software developers in San Francisco.Google is opening its A.I. technology to outsiders, seeking to attract developers. Last November, Google made the core of the machine learning technology its engineers use, called TensorFlow, available as free-to-use open-source software.This week at a conference in San Francisco, Google showed off a new speech-to-text transcription service. The company also said its recently introduced vision software for identifying images would be broadly available soon, and it introduced new tools and training aids to help developers build machine-learning applications more easily.Intelligent software applications will become commonplace, said Jeff Dean, a computer scientist who oversees Googles A.I. development. And machine learning will touch every industry.At Facebook, the A.I. vision is, at least for now, limited to its products.Mike Schroepfer, the chief technology officer, noted that Facebooks image-recognition software was now used to select what pictures or videos to show in a users news feed, based on a persons friend network and interests.Before, the photo was a black box to us, he said. And thats the most likely form this takes  a lot of things that add up to make the service steadily better on Facebook.If products come first, a platform strategy typically takes shape later for the big consumer web companies. There are millions of Facebook app developers worldwide. Today, only about 1 percent of all software apps have A.I. features, IDC estimates. By 2018, IDC predicts, at least 50 percent of developers will include A.I. features in what they create.Its where the market is headed, said David Schubmehl, an IDC analyst.The question remains, how quickly? To some, the rush to build platforms is taking place long before the technology has matured. What is more, they are still focusing on niches, said David B. Yoffie, a Harvard Business School professor. None of them have the opportunity to be as ubiquitous as an operating system became in the PC era,  Mr. Yoffie said.Some start-ups, like Diffbot in Palo Alto, Calif., are willing to jump into the fray with industry giants under the assumption that there is still plenty to figure out.The company, which was founded by Mike Tung, a Stanford computer science graduate student, in 2008, recently raised $10 million to compete directly with Google. Even though Diffbot is still being run out of a home near the Stanford campus, Mr. Tung is thinking big.Our goal is to capture all human knowledge, he said. I would like for Diffbot to build an iconic company around data. There are companies focusing on computing, but there is no Amazon of data."}
{"text": "CHICAGO   Mayor Rahm Emanuel has been publicly subdued in recent months, his caustic temperament largely under wraps as Chicago struggles through problems on all sides: a crime wave, financial troubles, public distrust and a struggle over civil rights.But one local issue, pitting environmentalists against a Hollywood director and local power brokers in a battle over lakefront land, has drawn out signs of the old and combative Mr. Emanuel. And it has turned a faded parking lot of crumbling asphalt into one of the most fiercely contested pieces of land here.The filmmaker George Lucas envisions that lot as the site of an undulating, futuristic showpiece of a museum devoted to narrative art, with three theaters and a 4,200-square-foot library.Local activists see it as a precious piece of Chicagos waterfront, a place of open views and public ownership. They have sued to block plans to build the museum.Mr. Emanuel has sided with Mr. Lucas, portraying the museum as a prize for Chicago, a singular cultural attraction and a shiny new addition to Chicagos expansive lakefront that he hopes will give the city an economic boost.He has been cautious in his public comments since the release of a video in November depicting the shooting of a black man, Laquan McDonald, by the police. The video set off furious dissent that reached as far as the streets outside Mr. Emanuels home on the North Side.But he has reacted to the lakefront dispute vigorously and, at points, sarcastically, mockingly dismissing Friends of the Parks, the group that filed suit to block the project, as Friends of the Parking Lot. On a recent radio show he denounced the group, saying it was endangering the project by forcing a legal fight to preserve a parking lot.I know where I stand, Mr. Emanuel said. I would like the lawsuit to go away so we can turn a parking lot into a museum. Its not that great a parking lot, trust me.The plan has hit a nerve in Chicago, where in 1836 it was mandated that the lakefront be public ground to remain forever open, clear and free.We think its ridiculous that the city of Chicago would essentially give away such an amazing public asset, said Juanita Irizarry, the executive director of Friends of the Parks. Our lakefront is our jewel. Many folks really appreciate that and value that.In the tradition of powerful Chicago mayors, Mr. Emanuel has already shepherded the project through the City Council. The Chicago Park District and the city Plan Commission have all approved plans for the museum, and construction was scheduled to begin this spring.But in February, Judge John W. Darrah of United States District Court refused to dismiss a 2014 lawsuit filed by Friends of the Park against Chicago to block the project. The suit argues that leasing the land to the museum is illegal.For Mr. Lucas, creator of the original Star Wars series, the battle is a bit of a sequel. In 2014, he pulled back from building his museum in San Francisco amid another furious community battle and after local officials rejected a proposal to construct the building on a prime piece of bayside land in the Presidio.Once San Francisco encouraged the project to go elsewhere, Mr. Lucas and his wife, the businesswoman Mellody Hobson, moved to bring the museum to her hometown.The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art would hold items from Mr. Lucass art collection, Norman Rockwell illustrations, paintings and photography. It would also explore the history of film and host screenings, lectures and workshops, museum officials said.Few people object to the content. It is the lakefront location that has them up in arms.There is this great historic legacy of the lakefront as a public amenity, which really is deeply embedded in the consciousness of Chicago, said Philip Bess, an architecture professor at the University of Notre Dame. At the same time, its in keeping with the history of Chicago that what happens on the lakefront depends on who has the power and authority. Its Chicago clout politics.Friends of the Parks would like to see the land turned into a natural sanctuary. Ms. Irizarry said she was especially irked that the museum was offered the land practically free, a 99-year lease for $10, with the option to renew twice.The museums planners have argued that the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art would be built in an area of the lakefront that is already heavily developed  within walking distance of Soldier Field, the Shedd Aquarium, the Field Museum and the Adler Planetarium. One of the hulking structures of McCormick Place, a large convention center, is just to the south of where the museum would be built.Its hardly an inviolate landscape anyway, said Henry S. Bienen, a former Northwestern University president who is a member of the museums board. Youre talking about a huge amount of buildings that are already there, some right on the lake. Georges museum would not obscure views of the lake. He described the museums chances of being built in Chicago as seriously endangered by the lawsuit.An increasingly frustrated group of people have recently argued that the museum should pick another site within the city. Thomas Hickey, a Chicago architect, even independently produced rough plans that would move the museum to the other side of Lake Shore Drive, which runs behind the land on the waterfront.Mr. Emanuel sees the museum as no threat to lakefront access, nor a blight on the waterfront.The Lucas Museum will offer incredible educational, cultural and economic opportunities in addition to adding more green space to the city, Shannon Breymaier, a spokeswoman for Mr. Emanuel, said in an email. Mayor Emanuel will continue to fight to ensure the museum and those benefits stay here in Chicago.Friends of the Parks and the city are expected back in court in April. As for the mayors Friends of the Parking Lot comment, the group has been restrained.There is a parking lot on it at the moment, Ms. Irizarry said. But we see it as an opportunity to someday have beautiful green space."}
{"text": "SEOUL, South Korea   The man drove Ju Chan-yang to a mountain overlooking North Koreas border with China. He looked around, making sure they were alone. Then he dialed his Chinese cellphone and handed it to her.On the other end was Ms. Jus father in South Korea. It was the first time they had heard each others voice since her father fled there two years earlier.We barely spoke 10 minutes before the connection was suddenly lost, Ms. Ju, 25, said, describing the 2009 episode during a recent interview. My father lost sleep that night, fearing that I might have been caught by North Korean soldiers.Smuggled-in Chinese mobile phones, which enable North Koreans near the border with China to gain access to its mobile networks, are an increasingly vital bridge between the North and the outside world.They connect North Koreans to relatives who have defected abroad, mostly to South Korea. North Koreans also flee their repressive country, as Ms. Ju eventually did, through a smuggling operation arranged by mobile phones.But the bridge has become increasingly precarious under Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.In 2014, Mr. Kim ordered his government to tighten mosquito nets to block foreign information from slipping in and prevent his people from communicating with outsiders and fleeing. The number of North Korean defectors arriving in South Korea, once as high as 2,914 in 2009, plummeted to 1,276 last year.Mr. Kim also strengthened a crackdown on mobile phones smuggled from China, deploying more soldiers and modern surveillance devices along the border to jam signals or trace them to those using the banned phones.In a 57-page report titled Connection Denied, Amnesty International said this month that North Koreans caught making calls on the phones could face criminal charges. If they call someone in South Korea or other countries labeled enemies, they could face charges of treason as well as incarceration in prison camps.Nothing can ever justify people being thrown in detention for trying to fulfill a basic human need  to connect with their family and friends, said Arnold Fang, the author of the report, which relied on interviews with experts and 17 recent defectors from North Korea.Mr. Kims clampdown on phones linked to Chinese mobile networks also heightens the risk for those who help bring news about his totalitarian country to the outside world. North Koreans use the phones to talk or send text messages and even photos to reporters and activists in South Korea and elsewhere.If they are caught by officials from the North, bribes are virtually the only way to avoid prison, or worse.When my sources call me, they shut the doors of the house and keep a lookout outside, said Kang Mi-jin, a reporter for Daily NK, a news website based in Seoul that focuses on the North. I tell them to have a place to quickly hide their phone and carry bribe money, usually 2,000 Chinese yuan, with them, always. It can decide whether they live or die.Thanks to her sources in North Korea, Ms. Kang, 48, broke some of the most talked-about news on Mr. Kims secretive government in recent years. She was the first to report that Mr. Kims wife, Ri Sol-ju, was pregnant in 2012 and that the leader was limping in 2014 because of ankle surgery.The people I talked to in the North are thirsty for outside news  asking as many questions of me as I do of them, said Ms. Kang, herself a defector. They want to know how defectors live in the South, how much a South Korean worker makes a month, whether its really true that South Korean housewives have so many pieces of clothes they throw some away.North Korea runs its own mobile phone network. Started in 2008 as a joint venture with the Egyptian company Orascom, the network, Koryolink, has more than three million subscribers. But it does not allow international calls. For ordinary citizens, landline calls are monitored and mostly confined to domestic connections.Internet access is also restricted to foreign visitors and a select elite. North Koreans are also not permitted to exchange letters, emails or telephone calls with people in South Korea.Thus, for ordinary North Koreans, virtually the only means of communicating directly with outsiders is to travel to the border with China and use cellphones that have been smuggled in.North Korean traders began using them during a famine in the 1990s to help illegally bring food and other goods from China.But North Koreans who have fled to the South since the famine also started hiring smugglers to send Chinese phones and SIM cards to relatives left behind. Defectors and Amnesty International said the illicit trade in Chinese mobile phones in the North was growing.In 2008, Choi Hyun-joon, 51, a North Korean defector in Seoul, hired a middleman in China. The middleman called his contact in North Korea on his Chinese cellphone and told him to find Mr. Chois daughter, Choi Ji-woo, in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.It took two months for the middleman to get his daughter to the border for a call with Mr. Choi. He first had to forge a travel permit for her; in North Korea, travel from town to town is closely monitored.Later, Mr. Choi wired his daughter 8 million won, or $6,700, in a transaction made possible by the Chinese mobile phone. Each year, defectors in South Korea send millions of dollars to their families in the North through intermediaries in China and North Korea who use Chinese mobile phones to arrange the transactions.By the time the money reached her, the sum had shrunk by half, the rest deducted as brokers fees for the middlemen.You lose 30 to 50 percent of the money, but still it is the only way to send money to our loved ones, said Mr. Choi, who managed to get his daughter out in 2010.Ms. Ju remembered the day that the middleman her father had hired appeared at a workers restaurant in Chongjin, a port city in northeast North Korea, where she was working in 2009.He discreetly showed Ms. Ju a code word only she and her parents knew, a combination of her and her mothers names.I knew I could trust him, Ms. Ju said. He said I should go to the border to make a phone call with my parents in the South.In the summer of 2010, her father called her to the Chinese border for the last time. There, she was handed over to a North Korean guard who was part of a smuggling operation. He helped her swim across a rain-swollen river to China. Once there, he used his cellphone to call another middleman to come pick her up  and pay his fee.The soldier had his Chinese cellphone wrapped in plastic and between his teeth when he swam across the river, said Ms. Ju, who arrived in South Korea in 2011. The phone is what links North Korea to the outside world."}
{"text": "Growing up in the Indian Himalayas, I saw a steady stream of professionals  doctors, engineers, lawyers  leave their careers and live in ashrams and caves near my village. I never fully understood their motives. But 20 years later, I had the same strong urge to spend an extended time in silence and find a deep center of stillness within me after my mothers untimely death from cancer.My wife and I had also been contemplating taking time off from our jobs to write novels. Wed been balancing writing with corporate jobs for a decade and felt we were falling short of excellence in both. As a result, starting in late 2012 we decided to take a full year off from our jobs and go on a spiritual and creative sabbatical.At the time, I was leading the Capri Sun and Kool-Aid brands as a director for Kraft Foods in New York, and my manager responded to my initial request for an unpaid sabbatical with a bewildered silence. Eventually, I convinced her  I think because I had the same specificity in my sabbatical goals as I had in my work goals. Rather than a general pitch of needing one year to find myself, I explained that I wanted to do a structured yoga teachers training for six weeks, spend one month in silent meditation, write for three months and so forth, all of which were emotionally urgent for me and would help me return more centered and effective.Paradoxically, though, we began our sabbatical by consciously letting go of our goals. Trained as an engineer, Ive always liked numbers, and over the years Ive used left-brained, analytical models to make most decisions at work. Even in writing fiction, I tend to be heavily outline-driven, planning out character and story trajectories in microscopic detail over months before I write the first word. I wanted to experience a glimpse of transcendence in my writing by becoming more intuitive.We went from Europe to India by road over three months with no plans and no bookings, deciding each day what to do next. On paper, this was a romantic idea; in reality, it meant a lot of nights sleeping in bus stands and train stations, and walking for miles with our heavy backpacks as we passed through small towns in places like Bulgaria and Turkey with no public transportation on weekends.We committed to spending the year in bare accommodations and choosing the cheapest modes of transportation. For a couple of years, Id been feeling that Id lost the simplicity of my life. Too many of my conversations were revolving around organic food, dinner reservations and Off Broadway shows. We wanted to start our journey by stripping ourselves of superfluous material noise.On reaching India, we learned yoga at a forest ashram in the south and meditation in the Himalayas. I was more agitated than calm in this period, mostly because I struggled with losing my independence while living on the ashrams tight clock. You had to wake up at 5 a.m. as soon as the morning bell rang; youd be marked absent from the yoga teachers training course if you were more than five minutes late for class. You couldnt speak during mealtimes; every minute of the day was rigidly scheduled.I was surprised by how discomforting it was to be a beginner again. For six months, I wasnt a director at a big company in New York. I was just someone whod barely done any yoga and meditation before and was reprimanded by gurus for being inflexible and restless. Slowly, I found a measure of stillness in the daily routine of the ashram, and I suspect that had as much to do with the gradual dissolution of my concepts and labels about myself, as it had to do with the practice on the mat.We spent the last three months of the sabbatical writing our novels in a small Portuguese village. I meditated and did yoga every day, and for the first time, I wrote without outlines, structures and detailed character trajectories, trying to just become a medium for my characters to tell their stories. Like much of the sabbatical, it was outside my comfort zone, yet deeply rewarding.Much to Krafts surprise, I did return to my job one year after I left. I thought Id be calmer after spending much of the year practicing yoga and meditation, but I constantly fell short of my expectations in dealing with the usual stressful work situations.Still, since my return, Ive become much less rigid than before. Perhaps as a result of losing control for much of the year, I find myself more comfortable with trying out ideas on bursts of inspiration and spontaneity, mine or others, versus linear, return-on-investment-driven models. Shortly after my return, for instance, I approved an advertising campaign that had nothing to do with the strategy I had planned, and it did better than anything Id done before.Ive also become more open about my career paths. Not everyone is on a straight line from director to president to C.E.O. In the past, at work I kept to myself my deepening interests in meditation and writing so they wouldnt be perceived as distractions from my career. Now I view them as one integrated stream of constant learning.Id expected to be passed over for promotions because Id taken a year off. Instead my career accelerated after the sabbatical, and I quickly moved to a more senior position at Kraft. Then I left Kraft to become the chief marketing officer at a start-up. However, I have enough deeply entrenched memories of sleeping on ashram floors and falling over while in headstands never to take the titles too seriously."}

The screen goes black, and there is the sound of an explosion. This Belgian filmmakers last film, No Home Movie, which will be released on April 1, is a documentary about losing her mother, set largely in her mothers Brussels apartment.In one scene, the two sit at the kitchen table, eating potatoes that Ms. Akerman has prepared, telling her mother that even she, the peripatetic artist, has mastered a few domestic skills. Its not hard to see the moment as a reference to a memorable potato-peeling scene in Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles, Ms. Akermans masterpiece from 1975 that depicts, in exacting detail and repetition, the daily routine of a Brussels housewife (Delphine Seyrig), up to an unexpected, violent climax.The way that kitchens  as much as bedrooms  can confine women but also provide intimate spaces for connection and conversation and serve as a backdrop to the drama and trauma of daily life is a recurring motif in her work. Her features and documentaries will be the subject of a retrospective at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, as well as tributes at Film Forum, Anthology Film Archives, and the Museum of the Moving Image, starting this month and running through April, offering New York audiences a fresh look at a highly influential avant-garde figure, who died in October at 65.Her cinema dealt a lot with confinement  how we close ourselves in and how we find ways to escape this prison that our spirit can build, that our body can build, said Marianne Lambert, whose documentary on Ms. Akerman, I Dont Belong Anywhere, opens Wednesday, March 30. That was connected to the history of her mother and of the Shoah.Ms. Akermans mother, Natalia Akerman, who died at 86 in 2014, was a Polish Holocaust survivor whose parents died at Auschwitz, and the specter of the Holocaust haunted the directors vision. I realized that my mother was at the center of my work, Ms. Akerman says in an interview in I Dont Belong Anywhere. Because now that my mother is no longer there, theres nobody left.The documentarys title is both existential and literal. Though Jewish and gay, Ms. Akerman shunned labels and turned down invitations to participate in Jewish, gay or womens film festivals. No, she says decisively in the film. I want to take part in regular film festivals.With an approach more instinctive than intellectual, Ms. Akerman had an outsized influence on other directors. Sofia Coppola has said she watched Jeanne Dielman in making her 2010 film Somewhere, and wanted to experiment with filming in real time. Somewhere, set in the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles, and her 2003 film, Lost in Translation, set in a Japanese hotel, also have echoes of Ms. Akermans 1978 feature, The Meetings of Anna, about a film director (Aurore Clment) traveling to promote a film  a study in stylized anomie, set largely in hotel rooms.In I Dont Belong Anywhere, the director Gus Van Sant explains how he modeled the cinematography of Last Days (2005) on that of Jeanne Dielman. Film critics have also cited the influence of the film on The Seventh Continent, Michael Hanekes first feature, which is built on the repetition of daily tasks. Others have spotted Ms. Akermans influence in the work of Richard Linklater, whose Boyhood, filmed over 12 years, pushed the use of real time in new directions.The director Kelly Reichardt said in an email that before making a movie, she always rewatched Jeanne Dielman and News From Home (1977), in which Ms. Akerman reads out loud letters from her mother in Brussels  loving, banal, domestic  over images filmed in gritty New York. They help clear the mind of all the nagging small moving parts and let you look at some clean lines, Ms. Reichardt said.In Jeanne Dielman, Ms. Reichardt said she was drawn to Ms. Akermans pacing, the way she lets things move through a frame and how her sound design might incorporate the rhythm of traffic or room tones. Ms. Reichardt added that she had studied Too Far, Too Close, a book of stills from Akerman films, while making Certain Women, scheduled for release this year. I would spend time alone in a room with just my viewfinder and my Akerman book and try to imagine how she might approach the space, Ms. Reichardt said.The French actress and director Mawenn, who had lamented the lack of a tribute to Ms. Akerman at Frances Csar film awards in February, said by email that she had recently discovered Jeanne Dielman, and described it as a revelation. At first look, you think: Nothing is happening, the shots are very long, she said. But once youve watched it, the film stays with you. It lives with you deep inside.Its hard to imagine Lena Dunham and Girls and their offshoots without the trail blazed by Ms. Akerman, who often turned the camera on herself, sometimes naked, in unexpected and unflattering poses. Just as its hard to imagine the lesbian sex scenes in Abdellatif Kechiches Blue Is the Warmest Color (2013) without the lesbian sex scene in Ms. Akermans Je Tu Il Elle (1975), which shows the director in bed with a girlfriend.I can think of no other film that is, in its sex scenes, as profound and playful a meditation about how we see sex in the movies, by being entirely what erotic experience in the movies is, for the most part, not, said Jennie Livingston, the director of the 1991 documentary Paris Is Burning, about gay and transgender dance culture.The sex scene in Je Tu Il Elle is a bit boring, yet fascinating as such, Ms. Livingston said. Incredibly beautiful, but beautiful like a puzzle or a painting or a river or a pair of acrobats, rather than beautiful like the wildly predictable series of clichs that make up the majority of onscreen sex.In her 1993 documentary DEst, (From the East), Ms. Akerman filmed the faces of people waiting for buses and trains in Eastern Europe with a slow, steady observational camera that transforms the everyday into the metaphysical. (In I Dont Belong Anywhere, Ms. Akerman said those scenes evoke people waiting for death.)Arun Chaudhary, the videographer for the Bernie Sanders campaign and previously President Obamas official White House videographer, has written that DEst influenced his videos. In between casual, home-movie-like shots of President Obama are the Akerman shots: the slow pans around the Oval Office, the tracking down long corridors and through open doors, the frames within frames, the crowds both engaged with and ignorant of the camera, Mr. Chaudhary wrote in The Forward in October.By making these extraordinary situations ordinary, by letting them be observed at length and letting the democratic forces of geometry and geography dictate the shot, I felt like I was practicing the Akerman ideal, he added.Kent Jones, the director of the New York Film Festival, singled out DEst and No Home Movie for elevating the seemingly insignificant. Thats the thing thats so amazing about her. Every element counts, he said. In a lot of other peoples movies, you have a hierarchy: There are things on the screen that the director is paying attention to, but sort of not. In her movies, everything matters.Inspired by seeing Godards Pierrot le Fou at 15, Ms. Akerman dropped out of film school in Belgium and lived in New York from 1970 to 1972. There, she was a regular at Anthology Film Archives, which showed classics as well as works by avant-garde filmmakers like Michael Snow. She was very obsessed, because she came every day, the filmmaker Jonas Mekas, a founder of Anthology, recalled.The film critic Amy Taubin said Ms. Akerman was the only filmmaker who absorbed the radical time structures of American avant-garde film combined with its commitment to personal work and employed all that in narrative art films. Ms. Taubin added: What was personal for her was the mother-daughter bond and how it played out in all the characters in her films. She didnt create female-centered work out of political concerns or expedience; it was simply the place where she lived.Ms. Lambert recalled how, after her documentary was shown at the Locarno Film Festival in August, some filmgoers thanked her for introducing them to Ms. Akermans work. A young woman approached me and said, When you see a woman like that, we feel that everything is possible, Ms. Lambert said. She had an inner force, which is very inspiring. I think these young people felt it."}

Concussion Studies Found to Have Deep Flaws, March 24: The N.F.L.s continuing efforts to obfuscate the concussion-science debate are predictable. Because the league has the resources to manufacture consent through so-called safety and education programs, beat back litigation and influence regulators, little will change. Backed by billions in profits and corporate welfare provided by cities and states, the league will continue to protect the shield. Its monopolistic power largely unchecked, the N.F.L. will continue to use and dispose of thousands of injured players with minimal regard for and support of their long-term health.

Thats how he came across to this childhood listener of radio broadcasts of St. Louis Cardinals games, where he worked alongside Harry Caray and Jack Buck.

No one calls for equal pay for the two as they sell their wares and succeed, or not, based on fan support. Who should make more at Grand Slam tennis tournaments, Novak Djokovic or Serena Williams? If women were bringing in substantially more revenue than men, the womens No. 1 would be the first to be asking for more money. There would be no speeches about egalitarianism or the long-ago struggles of Billie Jean King then.Novak Djokovic has offered an apology for comments he made regarding equal pay. He did not, however, retract his assertion that men bring in more revenue at Grand Slam events.

Any of the 110,194 ticket holders at Madison Square Garden would tell you that the competition and the story lines were nothing short of thrilling. While I was happy to see that The New York Times dedicated about 70 words to the tournament in the Sports Briefing section on March 20, it hardly did justice to the complexity and enthusiasm of this well-run tournament.ESPN broadcast the tournament on Friday and Saturday nights. The Times would have done well to dedicate more print to this event at the expense of oversize photos of the early rounds of N.C.A.A. basketball.DAN SCHAEFER, Maumee, Ohio"}

{"text": "THE VIOLET HOURGreat Writers at the EndBy Katie RoipheIllustrated. 306 pp. The Dial Press. $28.At the age of 12, Katie Roiphe developed pneumonia. She didnt want to admit how sick she was, and so she insisted on struggling to school, doing her homework feverish, waking drenched in sweat. When she began to cough up blood, she concealed it from her parents. Eventually she was hospitalized and had half a lung removed. During this alarming, exhausting period, she became death-fixated, soothing herself by looking directly at the threat that faced her. She developed a particular obsession with books about genocide, gorging herself on images of dead children.The desire to confront death stayed with her through the decades, quickening more recently when her beloved father died of a heart attack on the marble floor of his building, at the age of 81. What does it mean to die? How should one face it? Is there a good way of dying, as the medieval Ars Moriendi suggested, or should it be resisted at all costs?The Violet Hour is Roiphes impassioned attempt to answer these questions, by way of forensic investigation into the final months of six writers: Susan Sontag, Sigmund Freud, John Updike, Dylan Thomas, Maurice Sendak and James Salter. Ive picked people, she writes, who are madly articulate, who have abundant and extraordinary imaginations or intellectual fierceness, who can put the confrontation with mortality into words  and in one case images  in a way that most of us cant or wont.Sontag is the pugilist of the group. She twice survived terminal diagnoses of cancer, successfully pursuing the then unusual strategy of aggressive treatment. I am gleaming with survivorship, she wrote, and this ability to stare down death became part of her formidable myth, her intellectual glamour.The third diagnosis came in March 2004: myelodysplastic syndrome, a lethal blood cancer. This time, the odds were off; this time, it was harder to dismiss the pain, or convince herself that she was inching upward, toward health. She suffered through radiation, followed by a bone-marrow transplant. The treatment was agonizing. Worse, it wasnt working.One by one, members of Sontags support team realized she wasnt going to survive. But Sontag refused to accept that she was headed toward the end, an absolute denial that caused intense feelings of conflict for those who cared for her, a disparate group that included family members, friends, lovers and paid assistants.Sontags wholehearted resistance is unusual. Most of the writers here had more complicated, ambivalent relationships to their own dying. Take Freud, in exile in London during the Second World War. He was suffering from mouth cancer, but couldnt bring himself to give up smoking.As Roiphe observes, this is an exemplary illustration of his own concept of the death drive, the way a person can long in some quarter of herself for annihilation or extinction. Roiphe, the daughter of psychoanalysts, is subtle and incisive with this kind of material, at ease with ambiguity, capable of grasping how a man who has begun to reek of rot might still wish to inhale the pleasure-giving poison of his beloved cigars.And then theres Dylan Thomas, madly vital, hurtling greedily toward death. Roiphe tracks his rackety last days, reeling around New York in the fall of 1953. Is he suicidal, slamming down whiskeys in the White Horse Tavern, or is he clinging to the last joyous vestiges of life, gleefully sleeping with the hostess of a party while his mistress waits downstairs? Like many alcoholics, he wanted two things at once. The spectacle of him lying bloated and unshaven in a bed at St. Vincents Hospital, while half of literary New York watched him from behind a glass partition, is one of many indelible scenes here.Roiphes book Uncommon Arrangements dealt with complicated marriages and mnages  trois, and she is beady and generous on the aftermath of adultery, the blended families and shifting, complicated loyalties. Endearingly, a friend of Maurice Sendaks hired life models on Craigslist so the artist could have the pleasure of drawing naked men in his last years. But not everyone behaves with such thoughtfulness. Death doesnt always draw out generosity.One of the more distressing deathbed tales concerns John Updikes first wife, Mary, who visited as he lay dying in the house he shared with his second wife, Martha. Mary stood at the end of the bed, holding his feet through the covers, but didnt kiss him goodbye or have the final conversation she longed for because she assumed shed be coming back. She asked to return, only to be told by Martha that this was her last visit.The intensity of these passages  the depth of research, the acute sensitivity for declarative moments  is deeply beguiling. The rich excitement of dusk, Roiphe writes in an afterword on her research method, which involved long, rambling conversations with the surviving witnesses to her casts final months. Shes especially good at viewing a death through the lens of a lifes work, a mode that culminates in an illuminating reading of Sendaks masterpiece In the Night Kitchen.In her introduction, Roiphe writes almost hungrily of her desire to look at death unsentimentally, without romance. But in this Im not so sure shes been successful. These deaths kind of reassured me, Roiphe tells Salter, in the conversation before his unexpected passing, adding later: The beauty was what ambushed me.This is undeniably cheering, but it comes at the expense of a grave omission. Almost every writer here was intensely aware of mass death, meaningless death, death in which the individual is absolutely erased. They lived through wars, and they grappled with the specter of cruelty and annihilation in their own work with near-reckless courage.Roiphe is not especially interested in all that. There are brief mentions of Nazis and bombing raids, but as the book draws on it becomes increasingly clear that her project is to redeem death, to make it palatable, even a little glamorous.A single example. While she does mention that Sendaks relatives were killed in the Holocaust, her focus is far more personal in scope, mapping the damage inflicted by his angry, unloving mother and by the accidental death of a childhood friend. Among the biographical details that go untold is a story he recounted in a late interview, about how his father attended Maurices bar mitzvah the same day that he heard his entire family had been killed in the camps. Even as a very old man, Sendak remained haunted by the memory of his fathers vivid, livid face as the crowd sang For Hes a Jolly Good Fellow.Roiphe certainly read this interview, since she quotes from it approvingly that Sendak wanted to have a yummy death. We all do, of course, but death is not yummy, or sweet, or tame or even dignified. The livid, traumatized face of Maurice Sendaks father testifies to that: to all the vicious, violent, unspeakable things that death can be. This is a beautiful book, absolutely, but perhaps not quite as fearless as its author might have hoped."}

{"text": "The color is a fashion statement during these first weeks of spring, most noticeably on coats. Although the formal Easter parade (and its requisite flower-laden hats and orchid corsages) has long disappeared, fashion has rejuvenated the color for today. An interesting note is the orchid blossom: Originally the orchid was plucked from a plant and worn on Easter on its own, but in the 1920s, florists started adding ribbons, and by the late 30s and 40s, the single blossom got mucked up with pink tulle and glitter. Today, the beautiful orchid has returned to its natural state. The plants shown here at the Union Square Saturday Greenmarket are from Silva Orchids, which has been passed down through three generations of growers, who have grown many of the same plants for decades.Related column"}
{"text": "RE: THE MUSIC ISSUEThe special issue brought together 27 writers to examine where pop is now and where its going next.What will the future of music look like? The New York Times Magazine published an ambitious multimedia feature on Thursday that purported to answer that question, and apparently the answer is: pretty masculine. ... The writers who contributed are talented and diverse, and the selected songs include many written and performed by people of color  an extremely important factor, especially given how often black performers and artists have been written out of music history, and still are to this day. ... But one imbalance remained glaring: Out of 25 artists given the primary credit on the track noted, only four were women. ...The music industry has never been accused of being excessively gentle to women. In the past few months alone, the rampant sexual harassment and assault problem has made headlines, with female artists and music-industry workers speaking out about men within the field who have allegedly victimized women with impunity. ...None of this is remotely in the same category as the NYT Magazine lists far more mundane failure, but the current spotlight on womens struggles in the industry would, one would hope, be a reminder that female musicians face significantly greater obstacles to being viewed as serious artists as opposed to sexual objects and/or dilettantes among serious male professionals. Claire Fallon, on The Huffington PostTheres actually a lot to celebrate in this list. Theres some really beautiful, impassioned, engaged music writing from some talented writers talking about some equally talented artists. The pitfall, really, is in the lists delusions of grandeur: not only in its (probably winking) billing as a a one-time spectacular but also in its attempt to predict the future of something as broad as music in the space of 25 tracks. The resulting list is a nice summary of some of the bigger songs of the now (and Lionel Richie), but it turns a blind eye to the underground or experimental side of music, one of the areas where innovation has always historically taken seed. Angus Harrison, on Thump, a Vice site.I enjoyed many of the essays in your 25 Songs issue, but I was surprised by the parochial outlook it displayed toward the universe of human musical expression. An aesthetically narrow slice of current American pop hardly tells us where music is going.The miracle of the Internet is not that it allows us all to dissect Beyoncs Formation simultaneously, but that it offers access to some guy in Uzbekistan playing a dutar, Native American songs recorded within living memory of Little Bighorn, a techno-yoiker from subarctic Finland and Cambodian pinpeat music played on a leaf (the whole melody, on pitch). The shelf life of Justin Biebers newest hit is likely to be measured in weeks, but the future of music is embedded in traditions that have sustained culture for thousands of years. Fashion is fine and fun, but humans interaction with music is exponentially more substantial and enduring. Bau Graves, ChicagoJudging from the artists profiled, commercial success seems to be the only attribute that matters to any of these writers. Instrumental music of any kind is categorically disregarded. If it doesnt have a beat and a vocal, its not prequalified as music anyone could possibly like.Why not tell us about artists no one has heard of? Because its not about the music. The music only matters after the artists have been approved by the feedback loop of industry notoriety. Its reassuring to know that coolness and cuteness are still such essential elements for acceptance.As to where popular music is going? Thats easy, just follow the hype. Eric Klein, Montclair, N.J.The 25 Songs feature is an absolutely brilliant design solution. The font family that was used for the opening spreads was perfect, and the intermixing of type weights from normal to condensed was so effective. It had such an emotional connection with music in a way I cant explain. Jim Lienhart, Tucson"}
{"text": "SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.  David Peralta had a dream and a problem. His dream was to play baseball again. His problem was that he could not afford it.Peralta told his story the other day before practice at the Arizona Diamondbacks spring training complex. He would bat cleanup and play right field in their game that night, and with another season or two like last year  when he batted .312 with 17 home runs  Peralta will be very wealthy.Five years ago, he was poor. Peralta was trying to revive his career, which had fizzled in rookie ball as he pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals organization. In two seasons, Peralta had two wins, six losses, a 5.69 E.R.A. and a damaged shoulder. His 92-mile-an-hour fastball was useless because he could not throw it without pain. The Cardinals released him.Injuries and all that stuff, thats part of the game  its tough, but you have to deal with it, said Peralta, 28, who had two shoulder operations. But when they call you into the office and say, Hey, we have to let you go, thats tough to recover.His father, also named David, thought his son might have a future as a trainer. But he also remembered how well his son had once hit, how quickly he could whip his wrists to slash line drives. He had honed his sons swing by making him practice near a wall. If young David leaked back with his elbow, he would scrape the wall. He needed to be still, on time, and let those wrists attack.Peralta was not supposed to be a pitcher, anyway. But the Cardinals had happened to see him in his native Venezuela in a rare appearance on the mound, and Peralta threw five smooth innings.Weve got tons of hitters out there, Peraltas father said, quoting the scouts. Lefty pitchers with control, theres a lot less, so hes got a better shot of making it as a pitcher.It made sense, and Peralta accepted a $35,000 bonus. But it was also risky.If a position player stops hitting but can still throw hard, organizations might let him pitch; nobody wants to lose a promising arm. But failed pitchers rarely resurface as hitters. With so much specialization now in the amateur game, pitchers often never bat. And the low minors use the designated hitter, obscuring any batting skills a pitcher may have.Once you get into professional sports, you perfect one or the other, said the Hall of Fame manager Tony La Russa, now the Diamondbacks chief baseball officer.Peralta tried to perfect one, and went nowhere. With his familys encouragement, he went to work on the other, first in a government-run independent league in Venezuela. Peralta then returned to the United States  he lives in Stuart, Fla., with his wife, Jordan  and acted as his own agent, arranging for a tryout with Eddie Dennis, who managed an independent league team.Peralta made the team, which led to his big problem: The team  the Rio Grande Valley WhiteWings  was in Harlingen, Tex., in the now-defunct North American League.It was a long drive for me from Florida to Texas, Peralta said. It was like $600 to fly, and I didnt have that kind of money. I needed money for the gas.A friend was the manager of a 24-hour McDonalds in Stuart, and gave Peralta a job. He made fries and took orders, he said, sometimes working an overnight shift from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. He got paid, drove to Texas, hit .392 and resolved to never work at McDonalds again.There is honor in that job, Peralta knows. But it was not for him, not when he could still play baseball.Those people work hard every day, and for the money you make, thats not that much money, he said. Youre just making the minimum. And Im like, No. That kind of motivated me, like: This is not what I want. I want something better for me and for my wife and for my life and for my family. So that put me in the situation where I say, I have to keep going and not come back.In 2012, Peralta played for a different independent team, in Kansas, the Wichita Wingnuts. He batted .332. In 2013, it was back to Texas with the Amarillo Sox. He batted .352.By then, Peralta had drawn notice from Chris Carminucci, a Diamondbacks scout who had played and managed in independent ball, and even co-owned a team with Van Schley and the actor Bill Murray. Generally, Carminucci said, teams sign players from independent leagues simply to fill rosters in the minors. But those players bring an edge.When those guys come in, they want to rip your head off, Carminucci said. They are not there to make friends or hang out for a little bit and wear the uniform. They know if they dont get it done soon, theyll be gone.Peralta worked out privately for Carminucci, who was impressed by his bat control, strength and ability to hit to all fields. The Diamondbacks did not have an opening, he said, but he told Peralta to keep in touch.Peralta did as instructed. Every day, he would call or text the scout with an update on his performance. Carminucci was not annoyed. He was smitten by the skills and the unwavering confidence.Part of the reason was his tenacity, Carminucci said. This kid would not be denied. He was different. Some guys say they really want to be in the big leagues, but really what theyre saying is that they kind of want to be great. This kid was going to get there from the minute I saw him.A spot never really opened, but Mike Bell, the Diamondbacks player development director, decided Peralta had earned a chance. Carminucci bought his contract for about $3,000 in July 2013. What took you so long? Peralta told him.From there, Peralta rose quickly. He batted .346 at Class A Visalia (Calif.) the rest of that summer, and the next spring, it was clear the Diamondbacks had an impact prospect. He batted .297 at Class AA Mobile (Ala.).He cared about his secondary leads, he cared about how hard he ran from first to third, he cared about every fine detail, said Andy Green, the Mobile manager. He wanted to learn everything.La Russa joined the Diamondbacks that May and immediately toured their minor league system. He was startled to discover that Peralta had played in the Cardinals organization while he had been the major league manager. The sweet-swinging outfielder before him had never crossed his radar as a sore-armed pitcher.When I saw Rick Ankiel hit the first time, La Russa said, referring to the pitcher-turned-outfielder he managed in St. Louis, I thought: Stan Musial. Not the stance, but the finish of his swing was like Stan Musial. And when I saw Peralta, he was a made hitter.By June 1, 2014, Peralta had reached the major leagues. Green, who now manages the San Diego Padres, will never forget Peraltas reaction to the promotion.Blown away, Green said. Incredulous. Just didnt believe it at all, like, Youre lying to me. By the time it sunk in, he was literally curled up on the ground in a fetal position, crying.Injuries ravaged the Diamondbacks that season, but players like Peralta took advantage. He hit .286 in 88 games and earned a full-time job last season. Production from players like Peralta helped persuade the Diamondbacks  baseballs youngest team last season  to sign starter Zack Greinke, trade for starter Shelby Miller and take their best chance at competing in the National League West.He kind of epitomizes the way we play, Manager Chip Hale said of Peralta. He just plays hard all the time. Hes like a Labrador retriever out at the beach. You throw it in the water and hes just going to keep going to get it until you have to stop him. Hes the Freight Train.That is Peraltas nickname, which he wears with pride on a T-shirt in the Diamondbacks clubhouse. He plays with the same relentless abandon that got him to the majors, and said he would never stop.All I ask for is an opportunity, because for me, I just got one shot, Peralta said. Its do good or go home.The Diamondbacks took the player out of the independent league. But the independent league spirit lives on in the player."}
{"text": "JERSEY CITY  Anxious parents may wonder how a major school system like Newarks could overlook lead in the drinking water of 30 schools and 17,000 students. The answer: It was easy. They had to look only a few miles away, at the century-old classrooms of the schools here, across the Hackensack River.The Jersey City Public Schools district discovered lead contamination in eight schools drinking fountains in 2006, and in more schools in 2008, 2010 and 2012. But not until 2013 did officials finally chart a comprehensive attack on lead, which by then had struck all but six schools.This winters crisis in Flint, Mich., has cast new attention on lead in water supplies. But problems with lead in school water supplies have dragged on for years  aggravated by ancient buildings and plumbing, prolonged by official neglect and tight budgets, and enabled by a gaping loophole in federal rules that largely exempts schools from responsibility for the purity of their water.Children are at greatest risk from lead exposure, and school is where they spend much of their early lives. But cash-starved school administrators may see a choice between spending money on teachers or on plumbing as no choice at all.They feel its almost better not to sample, because youre better off not knowing, Marc Edwards, a Virginia Tech civil engineering professor who has fought for lead safety nationwide, said in an interview.The problem is persistent and widespread. Baltimores public schools switched entirely to bottled water in 2007 because ripping out the lead plumbing would have been impractical. Sebring, Ohio, found elevated lead levels in August after workers had stopped adding an anti-corrosion chemical to the water supply.The Los Angeles Unified School District allotted $19.8 million in September to retrofit or remove its 48,000 drinking fountains to erase a small but tenacious lead threat. Ithaca, N.Y., schools switched temporarily to bottled water in January after water tests found elevated lead levels at two schools.Congress could easily have cracked down on lead in schools. In fact, it once did. The 1988 Lead Contamination Control Act required schools to scrap lead-lined water coolers, test drinking water and remedy any contamination they found. But a federal appeals court struck down part of the law affecting schools in 1996. And while some states have devised their own lead-testing rules, federal lawmakers have yet to revisit the issue.The only regulation left is a 1991 rule by the federal Environmental Protection Agency requiring periodic tests for lead and copper by most public water systems, whether the supplier is a big utility or a well in a trailer park or campground.But although schools and day care centers are the main sources of water for children on most weekdays, only the few schools that operate their own wells fall under the rule. The vast majority of schools use treated water from utilities.And while the utilities test their water, virtually all lead contamination occurs inside schools  in lead pipes, water-cooler coils and linings, and in leaded-metal fountains and taps.If youre a mom-and-pop coffee shop in Sparta, New Jersey, and have a private well, youre required to certify every quarter, said Robert Barrett, the chief executive of Aqua Pro-Tech Laboratories, a New Jersey environmental testing laboratory. But if youre a school, you dont have to do anything.Mr. Barrett, whose firm tests water in 13 states, said the Newark and Flint revelations prompted reassessments by schools and other institutions that had not scrutinized their plumbing in years, if ever.No one was testing, he said. Now all of a sudden theyre all going crazy.In Newark, where school officials disclosed elevated lead levels earlier this month, Mr. Barretts firm began testing water systemwide on March 19. Students at the 30 schools now drink bottled water, and the youngest students were offered free blood tests.There, as in Los Angeles, high lead levels persisted even though workers flush the water pipes every weekday to push out lead that accumulates overnight. Nor did some filters on Newark school fountains reduce contamination sufficiently.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says children whose blood lead content exceeds five micrograms per deciliter  50 parts per billion, or less than a millionth of an ounce in a pint  should see a doctor. High blood lead levels can stunt a childs mental development and damage a range of organs. But even smaller amounts can affect childrens intellectual development, and the agency says no level of lead is safe.The E.P.A.s 1991 lead rule  the one that requires most public water systems to periodically test for lead and copper  limits the amount of lead in drinking water to no more than 15 parts per billion. The rule is being revised, though, and that limit could soon be lowered. Even though the rule does not apply to most schools, districts that do monitor drinking water generally use it as a guideline.Tainted water is not the biggest source of lead exposure in humans; on average, the E.P.A. says, it makes up about a fifth of contamination. Pregnant women working in schools are at greatest risk because fetuses are most profoundly affected by contamination. Women face an increased risk of miscarriage, along with potential organ damage and developmental problems in the baby.Schools built before 1986, when an amendment to the Safe Drinking Water Act banned lead plumbing, pose the greatest hazard. Fountains may be fed water through lead pipes commonly used in the early 20th century. Older water coolers may have lead linings and components.But even newer buildings can face a threat. Under industry pressure, Congress defined lead-free in the amendment as no more than 8 percent lead. Plumbing hardware like faucets and connectors often contained that much lead until 2013, when the permissible level fell to near zero.Los Angeles school officials learned of the 8-percent rule the hard way. In the 131 schools built over the last decade, the district installed thousands of water fountains with long-lasting brass fittings to reduce maintenance costs. They later discovered that the leaded brass fittings tainted the water in some fountains beyond the E.P.A.s lead standard.The districts $19.8 million lead initiative seeks, in part, to correct that. The approach were taking now is to get rid of anything with a brass fitting, Roger Finstad, the districts maintenance and operations director, said.In New York City, officials have uprooted and replaced all lead pipes leading from water mains into schools, swiftly replaced equipment when tests showed high lead levels, and ordered weekly pipe flushing at any school with a violation. All schools water is regularly tested. The result? Only 1.3 percent of nearly 90,000 water tests have exceeded the citys lead threshold. The program is a model for the nation, said Dr. Philip Landrigan, an expert on lead and a professor of preventive medicine and pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.That scorched-earth approach is the surest way to control lead threats, but few school systems have the money or knowledge to pursue it. Many instead follow a whack-a-mole strategy, testing a sample of water sources, then fixing or disabling ones with excessive lead concentrations.That can be ineffective, because the levels at any fountain or tap can swing wildly as residue breaks loose in lead plumbing. Dr. Edwards, the Virginia Tech specialist, recalled testing a single tap 10 times. Eight tests judged the water perfectly safe. The other two showed astronomical amounts of lead, he said, like eating five to 10 paint chips.This is like Russian roulette, he said.So it was in Newark, where the E.P.A. sampled water in 2003 as part of an outreach program on lead, and found contamination in three schools. The district began replacing school water fountains and installing filters on violating water sources, but never got ahead of the problem. From 2012 through 2015, nearly one in eight water samples exceeded the E.P.A.s 15 parts-per-billion threshold.Did we know we had a problem? Yes, said Marion A. Bolden, Newarks superintendent early last decade.  Did we think we had adequately remediated the problem? Yes.Here in Jersey City, the public schools are classic candidates for a lead problem. Two-thirds are over 80 years old, and a third more than a century old. The system had been under state control since 1989 because of poor management and low test scores; only recently, with Marcia Lyles as the superintendent, did the state agree to return control to local officials.Jersey City taps and fountains went untested until the E.P.A. took samples in 2006, again part of the federal outreach program, and turned up lead concentrations up to 60 times the federal threshold at eight schools. Not until early 2008, after more tests found fresh contamination at six of the schools, did the superintendent at the time, Charles T. Epps Jr., switch those students to bottled water.Jersey Citys mayor then, Jerramiah Healy, declared the matter closed. We believe this is a situation that is isolated to the affected schools and to certain water fountains within those schools, T he Jersey Journal newspaper quoted him as saying.Mr. Healy was wrong. The district tested all its fountains and taps in mid-2008 and found that water in 27 more schools was as much as 80 times higher than the E.P.A.s lead threshold. Under pressure from advocates, the district tested selected water sources at 38 buildings in 2010 and found yet more lead. In a 98-year-old school, Nicolaus Copernicus Elementary, 16 of 19 water fountains and coolers were found above permissible levels.That school and some others were switched to bottled water, and fountains and taps were turned off. But that was not the end.A 2013 retest of all 2,000-plus water sources found yet more contamination, including one fountain whose water tested 853 times the accepted maximum. Among those water sources were 10 in prekindergarten classes where daily tooth brushing was part of the regimen.Any fountains in this building, they dont even work, the Nicolaus Copernicus principal, Diane Pistilli, said this week. Parents were concerned, and rightly so."}
{"text": "THE NESTBy Cynthia DAprix Sweeney353 pp. Ecco/HarperCollins, $26.99.If only we all had problems like the Plumbs: the four adult beneficiaries of their familys $2 million trust fund. Mere months before the money is theirs, Leo, the oldest  loaded on martinis, antidepressants and truly excellent cocaine  makes off with a 19-year-old waitress and crashes his Porsche. A chunk of the inheritance is used to pay for the womans injuries, and each Plumbs share is reduced to a paltry $50,000.This story of first-world problems proves to be an enjoyable comedy of manners as Sweeney artfully skewers family dynamics, the publishing world and New York society at large. The Plumbs are Jack, a struggling antiques dealer; Bea, a former Glitterary Girl who has long failed to deliver the manuscript of her novel; Melody, a mother who can barely afford her mortgage payments; and the brother they begrudgingly lionize, the aptly-named Leo, the founder of a Gawker-like media empire. Each Plumb was banking on the inheritance to pull them out of financial, as well as personal, bogs. If only they had spared a thought for the legacy behind the trust fund: their fathers invention of a synthetic polymer batting used in maxi-pads and the quilted square of revolting plastic that still sits beneath every piece of slaughtered meat or poultry in the supermarket  designed to sop up a bloody mess. Just one example of the humor and delightful irony that abound in this lively first novel.13 WAYS OF LOOKING AT A FAT GIRL By Mona Awad214 pp. Penguin, $16.The universe is against us, which makes sense, Lizzie tells us as she sits in a suburban McDonalds with her best friend, Mel. So we get another McFlurry and talk about how fat we are for a while. Mel convinces Lizzie to proposition a nearby table of middle-aged suits, and here begins our protagonists descent into finding validation  mostly through the male gaze.We follow her many transitions: from adolescence to mature womanhood; from Lizzie to Beth to Elizabeth to Liz; from plus-size to very salady. She sheds her shapeless black Goth rags in favor of punishingly tight cocktail dresses. Some sections jump into other points of view, like those of a wannabe rocker who calls Lizzie only for a late-night hookup, and Tom, the husband who misses her heavier body: He is still getting used to the severely pared-down point of her chin, the now visible web of bones in her throat, how all the once-soft edges of her have suddenly grown knife-sharp. How they seem pointed at him in perpetual, quiet accusation.The book feels less like a traditional novel than a collection of 13 moving portraits of Lizzie at different cross-sections of her life, fulfilling the promise of its title  and the prophecy the teenage Lizzie makes in McDonalds: Im going to grow into that nose and develop an eating disorder. Ill be hungry and angry all my life, but Ill also have a hell of a time.THE PORTABLE VEBLEN By Elizabeth McKenzie430 pp. Penguin Press, $26.Veblen Amundsen-Hovda and Paul Vreeland meet in a Stanford research lab, over cafeteria coffees and neuro-techie chitchat. Veblen, named after the Norwegian-American economist who coined the term conspicuous consumption, is an Amlie-like Manic Pixie Dream Girl: a smart but spacey, undervalued woman with the handmade clothes and self-cut hair. Paul is a Brooks Brothers-clad neuroscientist who invents the Pneumatic Turbo Skull Punch  a pistol-like instrument for reducing brain trauma, clamored after by major suitors in pharma and the military. (Like Chekhovs gun, the Skull Punch will, of course, go off by the final act.)All seems to go well for the happy(ish) couple  right down to the fairy-tale proposal with a diamond the size of a horse pill. That is, until a squirrel begins to cast his foreboding two cents on the union, like a bushy-tailed Greek chorus. The fights between the couple begin to escalate  over wedding plans and family and the squirrel itself. Through the course of the novel, the question persists: Is the critter real or simply an extension of Veblens lavish imagination?A literary novel with a squirrel subplot may sound improbable, yet McKenzie adroitly skirts the line between the plausible and the absurd. Veblen, the books heart and spirit, wins us over with her sense of wonder about the natural versus the man-made world  a wonder that suffuses the entirety of this quirky, engaging novel.AMERICAN HOUSEWIFEBy Helen Ellis188 pp. Doubleday, $24.These stories of American housewives begin benignly enough: They grocery shop. They host co-op board soirees. They invite rule-breaking doormen to lunch and dismember them. They bid on estate sale jewelry that could be filled with teaspoons of cyanide. They dabble in taxidermy. Macabre does not even begin to describe this collection steeped in the Southern Gothic tradition. Flannery OConnor would turn green with equal parts sick and envy.Southern Lady Code and How to Be a Patron of the Arts are conduct manuals parceling twisted bits of advice like When a guest says your meatloaf looks like a football, dont tell the woman that her husband is obviously gay. Despite an outlandish premise, Dumpster Diving With the Stars, the books highlight, has real heart: A struggling novelist retreats into housewifery until she decides to compete on a reality television show against John Lithgow, a Playboy Playmate and Mario Batali.The book is riddled with pop culture allusions  from Beyonc to Miley Cyrus to Lululemon. But these topical references might date the book and risk alienating readers unfamiliar with whats trending on TMZ. It is a critique raised only because this dark, deadpan and truly inventive collection is one youll wish to relish long after its sell-by date."}

Ethereum, a rival to Bitcoin, has soared in value and climbed 1,000 percent over the last three months,\nNathaniel Popper reports in DealBook. Ethereums rise has attracted attention from giants like JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and IBM.At the same time, Bitcoin has struggled as its community has been riven with divisions, which has slowed down transactions and driven businesses toward alternative currencies.Ethereum, like Bitcoin, is built on a blockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly, offering the possibility of money and assets being exchanged more quickly and cheaply. Ethereum has also won fans with additional promises to provide a way to create online markets and programmable transactions known as smart contracts.The capabilities of the system have made it fascinating to executives  many corporations have created their own Ethereum networks with private blockchains, independent of the public system, which could detract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system, known as an Ether.The value of an Ether has soared as high as $12 from about $1 since the beginning of the year, bringing the value of all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times.The first full public version of the Ethereum software was recently released, but it could yet face the same technical and legal problems that have affected Bitcoin.Advocates for Bitcoin have argued that Ethereum will face more security problems because its software is more complex.

{"text": "Its been nearly 160 years since we Homo sapiens, or wise people, first got an inkling through Charles Darwin and the discovery of Neanderthal remains that we are just another evolving species on this planet. In recent years, the pace of new discoveries  made possible by advances in a broad array of disciplines, including biotechnology, genetics and paleontology  has increased.In 2010, scientists found that our ancestors not only crossed paths with other hominids on a similar evolutionary track, but mated with them. They discovered that modern humans interbred with Neanderthals because many people, mostly outside of Africa, carry DNA that matches material from the Neanderthals, our heavy-browed evolutionary relatives.Now a new study of global genomes, published this month in the journal Science, reports that our ancestors also crossed paths and interbred with another distinct hominid species known as the Denisovans.Like all the previous studies, the latest one raises at least as many questions as it answers. It found, for example, high levels of Denisovan ancestry in Oceania, thousands of miles from the Siberian cave where the species was discovered less than a decade ago. Does that mean the Denisovans wandered far and wide, or that they crossed paths somewhere else with modern humans who later settled in Melanesia?Another tantalizing discovery was that some regions of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA became more common in modern humans as generations passed, suggesting that it proved useful for survival, perhaps by supplying genes that bolstered immunity. But Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA was totally absent from four regions of the modern human genome, suggesting that there were areas in which our ancestors found better and unique evolutionary solutions.As discoveries and scientific methods multiply, we will become more familiar with our distant ancestors of all kinds and species. What is already evident is that our ancestry cannot be defined by a tidy genealogical tree, but is an ever-evolving, mysterious and wonderfully diverse tangle of roots and branches."}

{"text": "Outside, the daffodils have blossomed, and new leaves are unfurling from the trees. But inside the performance space Jack in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, blizzard conditions prevail. During William Burkes sometimes interesting and sometimes exasperating Pioneers!#goforth, swirling snowflakes coat the hair, bags and sweaters of the assembled crowd.Of course, this isnt snow, exactly. Its shreds of plastic that cascade from cradles in the ceiling and then are blown about by fans. This ersatz weather fits the speeches uttered by the actors Nikki Calonge, Ugo Chukwu and Zo Geltman and the songs composed and sung by Catherine Brookman. They describe futile searches for authenticity and originality, in which half-remembered commercials and blearily recalled photographs seem somehow more real than actual lived experience.This sense of artificiality is echoed in the script as well, a series of monologues with occasional pauses, which Ms. Calonge introduces as a ripped-off version of what could happen, of what happened. She explains this while dangling in a rope net strung above the audience. (A deliberately uncomfortable set, it abrades the actors and invites neck strain in the audience, but it also perhaps suggests the suspension young artists may feel when unable to commit to a work or a life.)Mr. Burke, a writer and director whose previous work includes the food was terrible and Comfort Dogs: Live From the Pink House, likes to meddle with, and sometimes excise, elements taken for granted in traditional theater: character, plot, stage space. His ideas are nearly always marvelous, the execution less confident. Though the actors are lively and distinct, their long monologues arent especially compelling, which Mr. Burke seems to acknowledge in a speech that the actors give twice: This is like the most boring thing. This is like a phone conversation. This is not theatrical.There are flashes of comedy here and sometimes pathos, too. Its hard to be young, its hard to create original work, its hard to hang from a net and keep your shirt from riding up. But more than an hour spent craning, covered in layers of debris, erodes our sympathies. Its a relief to finally shake off that fake snow and escape back into spring."}
{"text": "Rafael Callejas, a former president of Honduras who was accused of taking bribes in his role as president of that countrys soccer federation, pleaded guilty on Monday in the United States world-soccer corruption case.In federal court in Brooklyn, Mr. Callejas admitted he had solicited and accepted bribes from businessmen who sought media and marketing rights to matches played by the Honduran national team. Mr. Callejas paid much of that bribe money forward, he said, to delegates of his countrys soccer federation to ensure his re-election.Pleading guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and racketeering conspiracy  each of which can be punished by up to 20 years in prison  Mr. Callejas became the 16th defendant convicted in the United States governments continuing case.I abused my position of trust and authority, Mr. Callejas, 72, told Judge Robert M. Levy in United States District Court on Monday. I knew that it was wrong for me to ask for and accept such undisclosed payments.Mr. Callejas spent 13 years as president of Fenafuth, the Honduran soccer federation, after his four-year term as president of the Republic of Honduras in the 1990s. At the time of his indictment last year, he was a member of the marketing and television committee of FIFA, global soccers governing body. FIFAs leadership has been upended by the criminal case, which has implicated dozens of soccer officials from around the world.Wearing a dark suit and tie, Mr. Callejas said in court on Monday that he had been frequently outside of the United States while engaging in the schemes to which he confessed; he said, however, he understood that American banks had been central to those schemes.According to prosecutors, Mr. Callejas and a fellow defendant  Alfredo Hawit of Honduras, who has pleaded not guilty to similar charges  accepted bribes in connection with contracts for qualifying soccer matches for the 2014, 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments. From March 2011 to January 2013, at least $1.6 million in bribe money was wired from a Bank of America account in Miami to various accounts in New York, Panama and Honduras.As part of his guilty plea, Mr. Callejas agreed to forfeit $650,000 to the United States, $180,000 of which is to be paid within a week. The balance will be due within 12 months. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Aug. 5 and, until then, will remain under house arrest in the United States, having been released on a $4 million bond in December.The Justice Departments case was announced in May, and a new round of charges was unsealed in December. Of the 16 men charged in that second round, Mr. Callejas is the first to plead guilty; other defendants remain in their home countries, from Brazil to Panama, resisting efforts to bring them to Brooklyn to answer to charges.Mr. Callejass plea may signal a willingness to cooperate with the authorities, whose investigation is continuing, in hopes of a more lenient sentence. He and his lawyer, Manuel J. Retureta, declined to comment as they left court.Accepting the plea on Monday, Judge Levy complimented Mr. Callejas on the swooping signature that symbolized his acknowledgment of the terms of the agreement, making for a nearly 40 percent conviction rate 10 months after the governments FIFA case was announced.Is that your signature? the judge asked. I like it."}
{"text": "Donald J. Trumps campaign team plans to file a complaint with the Republican National Committee over the way delegates were chosen in Louisiana, where Mr. Trump won the primary but may emerge with fewer delegates than one of his rivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.According to Barry Bennett, who has been advising the Trump campaign on handling delegates, the primary issue is that Trump representatives were not invited to a closed meeting about how delegates were going to be selected.They had this meeting, Mr. Bennett said, and they didnt invite our delegates. The complaint with the R.N.C. will be filed at its meeting ahead of the national convention in July, Mr. Bennett said.Mr. Trump had suggested on Twitter over the weekend that he was being cheated out of delegates, adding, Lawsuit coming.Mr. Bennett earlier told MSNBC that he planned to attempt to decertify the delegates at issue, some of whom are uncommitted delegates who had that status right after the primary.Those bound to Senator Marco Rubio of Florida became uncommitted when he suspended his campaign. That issue is likely to play out over and over again, as those looking to block Mr. Trump from capturing the necessary 1,237 delegates to win the nomination look to peel off the uncommitted.Mr. Trumps operation has come under heavy scrutiny as Mr. Cruz and his team have worked within the partys system of rules to increase his chances if there is a contested convention. Mr. Trump confirmed earlier on Monday that he had hired Paul J.

{"text": "Jan Nemec, whose surreal, parable-like films made him one of the leading lights of the Czech new wave in the 1960s, died on March 18 in Prague. He was 79.His wife, Iva Ruszelakova, confirmed his death, the newspaper Dnes (Today) reported. She did not give the cause.In the years leading up to the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, Mr. Nemec established himself as one of the most formally inventive filmmakers in a group that also included Milos Forman, Ivan Passer and Jiri Menzel.In films like Diamonds of the Night (1964) and A Report on the Party and the Guests (1966), which brought him to the attention of American audiences when it was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1968, he explored the primal urge for freedom and the ways in which human beings, under duress, cope with lifes obstacles.He employed a style he called dream realism, relying on haunting imagery, flashbacks, seeming hallucinations and other dislocating devices to bend his narratives in unexpected directions.In Diamonds of the Night, filmed with a hand-held camera, two young men escape from a Nazi prison train and wander across a bleak landscape, their thoughts and fantasies played out on the screen as they encounter strange scenes and even stranger people.The unwitting characters on their way to a garden party in A Report on the Party and the Guests find themselves in thrall to a host who enforces a series of sadistic games, all in the name of good, clean fun.I am concerned with mans reactions to the drastic situations in which, through no fault of his own, he may find himself, Mr. Nemec once told an interviewer in a discussion of Diamonds of the Night. After all, so many peoples fates rest in the hands of others. Through his destiny I want to interpret the emotions a man goes through in such situations, to assess the meaning of his striving.Jan Nemec was born on July 12, 1936, in Prague. He played piano and clarinet and for a time thought of becoming a jazz musician until dissuaded by his practical-minded father, who convinced him that film was a more likely bet. He enrolled in the Film and Television School of the Academy of Performing Arts, known as FAMU, where the revered filmmaker Vaclav Krska encouraged him at every turn.Mr. Nemec graduated in 1960, earning his diploma after making the film A Piece of Bread, based on an autobiographical short story by Arnost Lustig about three prisoners being transported by train from one concentration camp to another and plotting their escape. While trying to steal a loaf of bread, they find themselves at one anothers throats.Diamonds of the Night, which, like his student film, drew on Mr. Lustigs wartime writings, put Mr. Nemec at the forefront of the new Czech cinema.He was invited to contribute to Pearls of the Deep, an anthology showcasing up-and-coming directors, with every segment based on a story by the Czech writer Bohumil Hrabal. Mr. Nemecs film, The Poseurs, told the tragicomic story of two elderly residents at a clinic who spend their days bragging about their glamorous pasts but turn out to be complete nonentities.With A Report on the Party and the Guests, Mr. Nemec began to run afoul of the government censors; recognizing the films subversive political undertones, they blocked its release for two years. He managed to complete a third feature, Martyrs of Love, which consisted of three love stories with farcical overtones, in 1967.After being barred from the state film studios, he quickly made a short film, Mother and Son, while attending a student film festival in Amsterdam, with financing from West German television and a Dutch film company, further straining his relationship with the Communist government.In 1968, he began filming the documentary Oratorio for Prague, intended as a hymn to the new artistic freedoms under the reformist government of Alexander Dubcek. The film, which ended with scenes of Russian tanks rolling through the streets of Prague, had to be smuggled out of the country.Unable to work as a filmmaker, Mr. Nemec was permitted to leave Czechoslovakia in 1974. He made several films for television in Germany, including a version of Kafkas Metamorphosis, before emigrating to the United States, where he made documentaries and videos.He returned to the Czech Republic in 1989 and for a time taught film at the academy of performing arts, his alma mater. He made the documentary Late Night Talks With My Mother (2001). At his death, he was filming The Wolf of Royal Vineyard Street, a comedy based on his life.In addition to his wife, Mr. Nemec, whose first three marriages ended in divorce, is survived by a daughter, Arleta Nemcova."}
{"text": "Jim Harrison, whose lust for life  and sometimes just plain lust  roared into print in a vast, celebrated body of fiction, poetry and essays that with ardent abandon explored the natural world, the life of the mind and the pleasures of the flesh, died on Saturday at his home in Patagonia, Ariz. He was 78.The cause was heart failure, his publisher, Grove Atlantic, said on Monday.A native of Michigan, Mr. Harrison lived most recently during the summers in the wild countryside near Livingston, Mont., where he enthusiastically shot the rattlesnakes that colonized his yard, and during the winters in Patagonia, where he enthusiastically shot all kinds of things.In both places, far from the self-regarding literary soirees of New York, for which he had little but contempt, and the lucre of Hollywood, where he had done time as a dazzlingly dissolute if not altogether successful screenwriter, he could engage in the essential, monosyllabic pursuits that defined the borders of his life: to walk, drive, hunt, fish, cook, drink, smoke, write.The result was prodigious: 21 volumes of fiction, including Legends of the Fall (1979), a collection of three novellas whose title piece, about a Montana family ravaged by World War I, became a 1994 film starring Brad Pitt; 14 books of poetry; two books of essays; a memoir; and a childrens book.His most recent book of fiction, The Ancient Minstrel, was published this month. A book of poetry, Dead Mans Float, was published this year.[ Read an appraisal of Jim Harrisons writing ]In Mr. Harrisons fiction, especially, lay some of the most vivid, violent and evocative writing of its day  work that in the estimation of many critics captured the resonant, almost mythic soul of 20th-century rural America.His books glisten with love of the world, and are as grounded as Thoreaus in the particulars of American place  its rivers and thickets, its highways and taverns, Will Blythe wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 2007, reviewing Mr. Harrisons novel Returning to Earth. He added, Bawdily and with unrelenting gusto, Harrisons 40 years worth of writing explores what constitutes a good life, both aesthetically and morally, on this planet.Though not strictly a household name, Mr. Harrison was long esteemed by a large, devoted cohort of readers in North America. He was also hugely popular in Europe  especially in France, where he was venerated as a cult author.Considered a master of the novella, a rarely cultivated discipline, Mr. Harrison was also known for his essays on food: He was perhaps the leading exponent of the small subgenre in which shotguns and shoe leather play a far greater role than balsamic reduction.His food writing, much of which first appeared in Esquire, was collected in his 2001 book, The Raw and the Cooked, whose title invokes the anthropologist Claude Lvi-Strausss volume of that name. Mr. Lvi-Strausss book is about myth and ritual. Mr. Harrisons is about rituals that include his flying to France for the sole purpose of having lunch  a lunch that spanned 11 hours, 37 courses and 19 wines.Because of his books hypermasculine subject matter, their frequent setting amid the woods and trout streams of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and his own knockabout life, Mr. Harrison was chronically, and to his unrelieved disgust, compared to one man.In fact, his prose is nothing like Hemingways: It is jazzier, more lyrical and more darkly comic. His characters, more marginal and far less self-assured  many abandon jobs and families to light out in search of meaning they never find  are handled with greater tenderness.Driving out of the woods I felt a new and curious calm but doubted it would last, the rootless narrator of Mr. Harrisons first novel, Wolf (1971), says as he returns reluctantly to civilization after a sojourn in the wild. He continues:When I reached the main road I would stop at a gas station and make a reservation at a hotel in Ishpeming and when I got there I knew I would shower and go down to the bar and drink myself into the comatose state I knew I deserved. Maybe King David drank heavily in his canopied tent the night before battle.At bottom, Mr. Harrison was not so much like Hemingway as he was like something out of Hemingway. Or, more accurately, something out of Rabelais  a mustachioed, barrel-chested bear of a man whose unapologetic immoderation encompassed a dazzling repertory:There was the eating. Mr. Harrison once faced down 144 oysters, just to see if he could finish them. (He could.)There was the drinking. One fine summer, he personally tested 38 varieties of Ctes du Rhne. (It was like a small wine festival. Just me, really, he told The Washington Post afterward.)There was the drugging, in his Hollywood period, when he wrote the screenplays for films including Revenge (1990), starring Kevin Costner and based on Mr. Harrisons novella of that name.There was the hobnobbing with his spate of famous friends, including Jack Nicholson, John Huston, Bill Murray and Jimmy Buffett.All these ingredients were titanically encapsulated in a dinner Mr. Harrison once shared with Orson Welles, which involved, he wrote, a half-pound of beluga with a bottle of Stolichnaya, a salmon in sorrel sauce, sweetbreads en crote, a miniature leg of lamb (the whole thing) with five wines, desserts, cheeses, ports and a chaser of cocaine.But constructing Mr. Harrison merely as a rough-and-ready man of appetite  a perennial conceit of profile writers, and one he did relatively little to dispel  ignores the deep intellectualism of the writer and his work. In conversation, he could range easily and without affectation over Freud, Kierkegaard, Stravinsky, Zen Buddhism, Greek oral epic and ballet.An acclaimed poet before he began writing fiction  his collections include Plain Song (1965), The Theory & Practice of Rivers (1989) and Songs of Unreason (2011)  Mr. Harrison received a Guggenheim fellowship for his poetry in 1969.Throughout his work, Mr. Harrison was intensely concerned with the natural world, though he was probably Americas least effete nature writer. There are no dewy prospects in his poetry and prose, but rather looming, unfathomable landscapes with the power to unleash an almost biblical violence.Yet for all this  and for all its man-made violence (in Legends of the Fall, for instance, one character kills another with a pitchfork)  the world of his fiction is an eminently moral place, one in which vengeance follows violation with a ruthless internal logic.Counterbalancing the undertow that pulls at Mr. Harrisons characters are food, alcohol, sex and outdoorsmanship, ideally in combination. As he often said, this restorative cocktail was his own remedy of choice for the bouts of deep depression from which he had suffered all his life.If youve known a lot of actresses and models, he once confided with characteristic plain-spokenness to a rapt audience at a literary gathering, you return to waitresses because at least they smell like food.What united Mr. Harrisons literary output was an acute awareness of the sustenance that close observation of ordinary things can offer, as well as an essential truth he summarized in a 1980 interview with The Washington Post:Im always having a man in desperate straits trying to help somebody else out with no apparent success, Mr. Harrison said, because nobody can be helped by anybody.That truth became evident when he was very young. James Thomas Harrison was born on Dec. 11, 1937, in Grayling, in northern Michigan, the son of Winfield Harrison and the former Norma Walgren; he was reared in Reed City, 90 miles away.Winfield Harrison, a county agricultural agent, passed on to his son a love of books as well as more pragmatic endowments that would be useful in life and in literature. (When you sit in a bar, the elder Mr. Harrison counseled, never curl your feet under the rungs of a bar stool in case youre sucker punched.)When Jim was 7, as he recounted in a memoir, Off to the Side (2002), a neighborhood girl ended a quarrel by thrusting a broken bottle into his face, permanently blinding his left eye. For years afterward, he sought solace alone in the woods.He also found solace in fiction  his father had turned him on to Faulkner, which became a lifelong passion  and by the time Jim was a teenager, he was determined to be a writer. His father encouraged him, buying him a typewriter for about $15.When Jim Harrison was in his early 20s, his father and his 19-year-old sister, Judith, were killed on a hunting trip, when their car was struck by a drunken driver. Jim had also been invited but had vacillated before choosing not to go.The decision probably saved his life. But in delaying the start of the trip, which put his father and sister on the road at precisely the wrong moment, he felt he had caused their deaths.Mr. Harrison earned a bachelors degree in comparative literature from Michigan State University, where his classmates included the future novelist Thomas McGuane, followed by a masters in the field there. In the mid-1960s, he taught briefly at the State University of New York at Stony Brook before turning his back on academe for the writing life.It was a life of real poverty at first. His first three works of fiction  Wolf was followed by the novels A Good Day to Die (1973) and Farmer (1976)  were well reviewed but not hugely successful commercially. There was no security in poetry.By then a husband and father, Mr. Harrison was earning barely $10,000 a year. He considered suicide.He pulled himself through by starting work on Letters to Yesenin, published in 1973 and widely considered his finest volume of verse. Its title invokes the great Russian poet Sergei Yesenin, who committed suicide in 1925, at 30.In a poem from the collection, Mr. Harrison wrestles with the decision the poet confronted. But, addressing Yesenin, he reaches a far different conclusion:With the publication in 1979 of Mr. Harrisons fourth volume of fiction, Legends of the Fall, he found his mtier in the novella  and with it the commercial success that had long eluded him.Mr. Harrison had his detractors. With its boozing and brawling and bedding, his fiction was often called misogynistic. He did himself no favors with a 1983 Esquire essay in which he called his feminist critics brie brains and added, in gleeful self-parody, Even now, far up in the wilderness in my cabin, where I just shot a lamprey passing upstream with my Magnum, I wouldnt have the heart to turn down a platter of hot buttered cheerleaders.But by all accounts he redeemed himself with several later works narrated by strong female protagonists: the novels Dalva (1988), about a Nebraska woman searching for the child she gave up for adoption, and The Road Home (1998), which continues Dalvas story; and the novella Julip (1994), about a woman trying to free her brother from jail.Mr. Harrisons wife, the former Linda King, whom he married in 1959, died in October.His survivors include two daughters, Jamie Potenberg and Anna Hjortsberg; a sister, Mary Dumsch; a brother, David; and three grandchildren.In an essay in The Raw and the Cooked, Mr. Harrison neatly summed up the modus vivendi that had long sustained him. He was talking about food, but the imperative clearly applied to any of his variegated passions:The idea, Mr. Harrison wrote, is to eat well and not die from it  for the simple reason that that would be the end of your eating."}
{"text": "ON Aug. 31, 1772, a hurricane devastated the island of St. Croix, the home of the teenage Alexander Hamilton. In a letter one week later, he described the force of the storm and the destruction it caused as sufficient to strike astonishment into angels.His letter included this plea for help for his countrymen: O ye, who revel in affluence, see the afflictions of humanity and bestow your superfluity to ease them. Say not, we have suffered also, and thence withhold your compassion. What are your sufferings compared to those? Ye have still more than enough left. Act wisely. Succour the miserable and lay up a treasure in Heaven. So vivid was his account of the disaster that the letter was published in a newspaper in the Virgin Islands, The Royal Danish American Gazette, and used to support relief efforts for the island.Im invoking Hamiltons words today, in this plea for relief for Puerto Rico.Much has been said about the dire economic situation pressing down on Puerto Rico. I am the son of Puerto Rican parents. What can I say to persuade elected officials and policy makers to act? What influence do I have to change the minds and hearts of those in Congress to put aside their differences and deal with the crisis confronting 3.5 million American citizens in the Caribbean? Im not a politician or an economist. Im a storyteller.More than 150 schools on the island have closed. San Jorge Childrens Hospital, Puerto Ricos largest pediatric hospital, has been forced to close two wings and 40 rooms, and cannot afford to hire the nurses it needs. Its estimated that a doctor a day leaves the island. Engineers, accountants, blue-collar workers and entire families are emigrating daily. According to the census, Puerto Rico has lost 9 percent of its population in the last decade, with 84,000 leaving last year alone.This is not the Puerto Rico I remember. Every summer my sister Luz and I stayed with our grandparents in Vega Alta, a small town on the northern coast. My grandfather managed the town credit union  a real-life George Bailey if ever there was one. My grandmother owned a travel agency, Viajes Miranda. My aunt Yamilla owned the school supply store next door, and I sold candy to returning students in August.In Vega Alta, I was el nene de Luisito, que se fue a Nueva York (The son of Luisito, who left for New York) but welcomed every summer as a cherished member of the community, despite my halting Spanglish. I walked from one end of town to the other, waving at the business owners, many of whom went to church with my grandparents, feeling a sense of community that often eluded me back in New York.Today, most of those storefronts  the school supply shop, the travel agency and many more  are boarded up, with little hope of housing new businesses. Residents like the towns mayor, Isabelo Molina, and my uncle Elvin, who heads a Pentecostal church there, are working hard to change that. They have learned to stretch a dollar as far as it can go. But Puerto Ricos $72 billion debt, which is equal to about 68 percent of the islands gross domestic product, thwarts efforts for economic development.There are remedies when governments run up debt. If Puerto Rico were an American city, it could declare bankruptcy, as Detroit did in 2013. If it were a state, the federal government would surely have already declared emergency measures to help the most vulnerable. But since it is a territory of the United States, there is no system in place to handle the financial and humanitarian crisis that is happening right now.Please let us not get bogged down in Puerto Ricos status. If a ship is sinking, you dont ask, Well, what type of ship is it and what type of ship should it be? You rescue the people aboard.What Puerto Rico needs, as a first step, is what almost any other company or government has  the ability to restructure its debt. Congress can make that happen. The island is in danger of defaulting on some of its larger loans and it is already being sued by creditors. An act of Congress in support of restructuring would help bring creditors to the table to develop a workable plan that could satisfy debtholders and relieve the punishment of the people of Puerto Rico.This is not a Republican issue. This is not a Democratic issue. This is an American issue. When 3.5 million of our citizens face the consequences of financial collapse, we should act. Because Puerto Ricans can vote neither for the president nor for congressional representatives, it falls to us of Puerto Rican heritage in the continental United States to amplify their plea.By chance, I picked up Ron Chernows biography of Alexander Hamilton in 2008 and found the inspiration that changed my life. I recognized, in Hamiltons ability to write his way out of his difficult circumstances, a kindred spirit. I write about Puerto Rico today just as Hamilton wrote about St. Croix in his time. Congress, please dont play politics with the lives of 3.5 million Americans. Succor the miserable and lay up a treasure in heaven. We are counting on you."}
{"text": "There were screams of joy from the Apollo Theater audience when Bombino, from Niger, played guitar solos on Saturday night, headlining the Africa Now! concert. Yet if Bombino is a guitar hero, he may be the most laconic one ever. His solos arent long or fast; they mostly circle through the same riffs, each just a handful of notes, that drive his songs. He seizes the foreground with a fiercer attack, a note or two placed differently, a sudden trill  stings and jabs and displacements, not discourses. Over the relentless beat of his band, those were more than enough to ignite an already dancing crowd.Bombino, the nickname of Omara Moctar, is a Tuareg, a member of the nomadic desert population that overlaps borders in Niger, Mali, Algeria and Libya. In recent decades, electric guitars have carried Tuareg sentiments of militancy, protest and lament. In songs from his new album, Azel (Partisan), Bombino sang on Saturday about how materialism was displacing ancestral ways, about the merciless conditions of the desert and about lost love  thoughtful tidings delivered with brisk, sinewy guitar lines and arrangements that accelerated dramatically as they went.Bombinos way of preserving Tuareg culture is to package it for the wider world. His three albums have been produced by Americans, who hear the similarities of Tuareg rock to the pentatonic modes of blues and the incantatory drones of psychedelia. Nomad, from 2013, was produced by Dan Auerbach of the Black Keys, and Azel is produced by Dave Longstreth of the African-influenced art-rock band Dirty Projectors. The bands drummer, Cory Wilhelm, is also American. But both onstage and on his albums, Bombino comes across as undiluted and forceful, saying exactly what he wants with only as many notes as it takes.It was the fourth annual Africa Now! concert, presented by the Apollo and the World Music Institute; the public-radio program Afropop Worldwide recorded it for eventual broadcast. The quadruple bill squeezed the time for the other artists. Mokoomba, a band from a border town in Zimbabwe, draws its music from across the continent, particularly southern Africa; its 2012 album, Rising Tide (Igloo), includes 12 songs in eight languages. So three songs were only a glimpse of Mokoombas capabilities  a glimpse that included a modal ballad with riveting, griot-strength lead vocals from Mathias Muzaza; a song rooted in the thumb-piano patterns of Zimbabwean tradition; and one that started with sweet, Congo-style vocal harmonies and grew into a crisp, irresistible soukous workout, complete with some synchronized dance steps. A full-length set would have been welcome.Alsarah and the Nubatones are a Brooklyn group led by Alsarah, a singer from Sudan. Her songs, which she described as East African retro-pop, looked toward the sparseness of Arabic music, accompanying her voice  gentle at first, then revealing a steely core  with oud, percussion, electric bass and a backup singer. Like the other performers, her lyrics held messages of social conscience; one song, she explained, criticized governments that did not protect human dignity.Jojo Abot, from Ghana, represented globalized African experimentation and pop ambition. She divides her time among Accra, Copenhagen and New York City, and some of her lyrics are in English, including a new Afrobeat song that ended her set: STV (Stop the Violence). She appeared in lavish robes and a mask of glittering golden face paint, and her music drew as much from reggae, electronics and alternative R&B as from direct African sources. She sang, rapped and toasted, reggae style, with a voice that was often tart and sassy; it could also be a cutting rasp, an airborne soprano or an insistently comical squeak. Even as she ricocheted among styles and languages, her songs had pop vocal hooks  To Li Pi Lo Lo  that lodged themselves quickly."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Dying, With Nothing to Say, by Katie Roiphe (Sunday Review, March 20), hits painfully close to home.I never got a chance to say goodbye to my father. He died while I was on a plane home from Europe to spend a last couple of months with him. That was 26 years ago and it still lies unresolved, deep within me.If I had the opportunity to turn back the clock, to have had even one last meeting, I would have told him how much I loved him and said what I wanted him to know. What he might have said in return would have simply been icing on the cake.We cant put too much upon our loved ones who are dealing with death and illness. I only know that, if given the opportunity, the person I am 26 years later would know how to better handle those final moments.MELINDA PHILLIPSHoustonTo the Editor:In 2005, I picked up my mother-in-law, Mary, from the airport as she returned from vacation. I brought her to my home for some soup and then helped her load her car for her half-hour drive home. As she was stepping into her car, she turned and said, Johnny, I tell all my friends that you are perfect.An hour later, my wife and I were called to the emergency room, where we found that Mary had died in a car accident.While knowing that I am hardly perfect, I have treasured Marys last words ever since. Katie Roiphe suggests in her article that, with the approach of death, we anticipate the opening of a new, honest, generous space in which there is a directness, an expansiveness that can be filled with meaningful last words.Mary showed that we can create and fill such a space with special words on any day, without knowing whether or not death is at hand.JOHNNY WILLISSchenectady, N.Y.To the Editor:Katie Roiphe told my story.Closing in on my 91st birthday, I recently endured visits by my four adult children. My life, past and present, was of no interest. They asked me nothing  certainly nothing meaningful to me. Regrettably, they inflicted, chapter and verse, what Id put my own mother through a generation before.Plus a change?JACK OSGOODBostonTo the Editor:While Katie Roiphe writes about people in the last hours of life, the uncomfortable reality is that we are all dying.I am a health psychologist who studies people at the end of life. I became a bereaved daughter when I was 25 years old. These experiences taught me that the trick to having something to say, or those deep and meaningful conversations, come to people who are able to face their own mortality well before they are on their deathbeds.Dying, like giving birth, is a biological event. Giving birth does not instantly turn women into excellent mothers any more than dying turns one into a wise Buddha.If we want to have a good death, we need to invest in a good life. Look death in the eye every day, and remember that time is finite, that our loved ones will not always be here, and that the time to talk is right now.LEEAT GRANEKTel AvivThe writer is an assistant professor and head of the gerontology and sociology of health program at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev.To the Editor:I made a mistake that can never be rectified. As my aged, beloved mother lay near death, she said to me, There are things I never told you. I answered, You dont have to tell me now. I intended to save her any emotional pain, but it was a mistake. I should have asked, Do you want to tell me now?I will never know if she wanted to confess some secret in her own life or to tell me that she had somehow interfered with mine while I was a young girl.My mother gave me confidence that I was a kind and sensible person by setting that example herself. Now I wish that I knew why and what it was that she hid from me and if it could have affected my life. I shouldnt care, but I do wonder.As Katie Roiphe writes: But if one does actually manage to pull off a last conversation, what can it be but a few words in a lifetime of talk? How can it be enough?IRIS KAUFMANPeabody, Mass."}
{"text": "ROME  Silicon Valleys battle over encryption is heading to Europe.In the United States, the F.B.I.s demands that Apple help unlock an iPhone used by a mass killer in California opened a heated debate on privacy. After recent attacks on the Continent, like the bombings in Brussels last week and the wave of violence in Paris last November, governments across the European Union are increasingly pushing for greater access to peoples digital lives.This week, French lawmakers are expected to debate proposals to toughen laws, giving intelligence services greater power to get access to personal data.The battle has pitted Europes fears about the potential for further attacks against concerns from Apple and other American technology giants like Google and Facebook that weakening encryption technologies may create so-called back doors to peoples digital information that could be misused by European law enforcement officials, or even intelligence agencies of unfriendly countries.The recent attacks have pushed many Europeans to favor greater powers for law enforcement over privacy. But opponents say such measures should not undermine the regions tough data protection rules that enshrine privacy on par with other rights like freedom of expression.This balance between national security and privacy has put major countries in the region on opposite sides of the debate, with Germany and the Netherlands dismissing encryption laws being considered by Britain and France.Fundamental rights are just that, fundamental, said Nico van Eijk, a data protection expert at the University of Amsterdam. Of course, there are exceptions for national security reasons. But governments have to be pragmatic.That pragmatism has led to a series of new proposals across Europe that, if approved, would give national intelligence agencies renewed powers to compel the likes of Apple, Google and Facebook to hand over encrypted information.In Britain, lawmakers are completing legislation that could force tech companies to bypass encryption protections in the name of national security. The law  called a snoopers charter by opponents  may compel companies to aid the countrys law enforcement agencies by hacking peoples smartphones and computers, among other powers.And on Tuesday, French politicians will debate proposals to update antiterrorism laws that may hand tech executives prison sentences of up to five years, as well as fine their companies around $390,000, if they refuse to provide encrypted information to the countrys investigators.Amendments to the French law  itself a response to the attacks in November  may still pass without the encryption proposals, which are opposed by Frances left-wing government.But politicians and industry executives say Apples fight with the F.B.I. has focused a spotlight on how companies efforts to protect users messages and other data have made it increasingly difficult for European intelligence agencies to obtain such information.When were able to recover a cellphone, but authorities have no way of accessing its data, it obviously cripples the work of our surveillance agencies, said Philippe Goujon, a French politician behind the recent encryption proposals.Sure, this could have repercussions internationally, he added. But there are other countries in the world that have similar legislation.Europes attempts to get access to encrypted data have not gone unchallenged by Apple.Timothy D. Cook, Apples chief executive, has, for instance, met with a string of European politicians, including Frances prime minister, Manuel Valls, and Britains home secretary, Theresa May, in recent months to lobby for tough encryption technology.And to show that the company is trying to be cooperative, Apples executives have also provided unencrypted information, including so-called metadata on peoples phone calls and GPS coordinates, as part of terrorism investigations in Europe, according to a person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.Such efforts, in part, have paid off with some European governments that remain skeptical of plans to weaken companies encryption technology in the name of national security.Germany, which has some of the worlds toughest privacy rules, has balked at the proposals Britain and France are considering, while the Dutch government published an open letter this year expressly stating its opposition to back doors in encryption services provided by the likes of Apple.Such loopholes, the Dutch government said, would also make encrypted files vulnerable to criminals, terrorists and foreign intelligence services.As pressure in parts of Europe mounts over access to encrypted data, industry watchers say attention is expected to focus on Britain  a top international market for most American tech companies  where expanded powers for the countrys intelligence services are likely to come into force by the end of the year. The legislation is the brainchild of the ruling Conservative Party, which has a sufficient parliamentary majority to enact the regulatory changes.Under the proposals, the Investigatory Powers Bill would force Internet and telecommunications companies to hold records of websites visited by people in Britain over the last 12 months. It also would provide the countrys intelligence agencies with a legal mandate for the bulk collection of large quantities of data, while allowing them to hack individual devices under certain situations.Ms. May, Britains home secretary, told lawmakers this year that such powers were required to defend the countrys security. She added that the legislation offered sufficient transparency and oversight about how British spies conducted their activities to calm peoples privacy concerns.But for Apple and other Silicon Valley companies, the proposal also includes new powers that can permit the British government to demand that companies remove encryption protections where reasonably practicable to gain access to digital communications.The British government stresses that such rules would not undermine companies services because they may not apply to so-called end-to-end encryption, technology used by the likes of Apples iMessage and FaceTime services, as well as Facebooks WhatsApp Internet messenger.But in a series of appeals to the British Parliament, several American tech giants, including Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo, have complained that the proposals could force them to create backdoor access for the countrys spies, or face falling afoul of the new national security rules.A key left under the doormat would not just be there for the good guys, Apple wrote in its recent statement to British lawmakers. The bad guys would find it, too.Such concerns, security experts say, could be compounded if other national governments  either in Europe or farther afield  followed Britains lead by passing similar legislation.If these encryption plans go through, then whos to stop France or other countries asking for the same thing? said Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge who wrote a paper with other experts last year that criticized the American and British governments plans to weaken encryption. When you give one country backdoor access, where do you stop?"}
{"text": "Can video games be more than just entertainment? Can they actually teach important information and critical thinking skills?Should there be more educational video games in school?Justice Sandra Day OConnor has become a strong proponent of using educational video games to teach civics. In A Supreme Court Pioneer, Now Making Her Mark on Video Games, Natasha Singer writes:Justice Sandra Day OConnor, who turned 86 on Saturday, has many achievements to her name, including serving as a state senator in Arizona and becoming the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court, where she served for almost a quarter-century.Now she can add an accomplishment for the digital era: video game impresario.Justice OConnor is behind an animated civics education game called Win the White House, whose latest edition was recently released. The game has been played by more than 250,000 students just this month and is barnstorming its way through middle schools across the United States.In the game  timed to this election cycle  students take on the role of imaginary presidential candidates who must learn how to compete civilly against opponents with divergent views on issues like immigration and gun control.That Justice OConnor would become an interactive game enthusiast may seem unexpected. Until a few years ago, she had never watched a video game  let alone played one.I was one of the uneducated adults, she joked in a recent telephone interview from her home in Phoenix. Speaking of the learning objective of Win the White House, she explained, We have to have a system that allows young people to approach problem solving from many different viewpoints.Justice OConnor became involved in digital games after retiring from the Supreme Court in 2006. She started iCivics, a nonprofit civics education group, in 2009.The group has since released 19 free online games, along with accompanying lesson plans, with the idea of making civics education less about rote learning and more about giving middle school students an animated glimpse into how different branches of government and the Constitution work. About 3.2 million students played iCivics games last year, the group said.Students: Read the entire article, then tell us: Should there be more educational video games in school? Is using video games in education an effective way to engage students while teaching them important information and critical thinking skills? Have any of your teachers assigned a video game as a learning tool? If yes, what game (or games)? Did it help you learn anything? Or is the push to bring educational video games into the classroom misguided? Will they end up being a time waster instead of an effective learning tool?

{"text": "Sean Combs, the hip-hop mogul known as Diddy, steered the creation of the Capital Prep Harlem school, scheduled to open in fall 2016, he said on Monday.In a statement, Mr. Combs, who was born in Harlem, said creating the school was a dream come true for me.The charter school was approved by the Board of Regents in 2014, but Mr. Combss involvement had not been previously publicized. The school will replicate the model of Capital Preparatory Magnet, a year-round school in Hartford that says it has high graduation and college acceptance rates.The founder of the Hartford school, Steve Perry, said in an interview on Monday that it was unclear what role Mr. Combs would play in the new school. Beginning in 2011, Mr. Combs recruited Mr. Perry to bring his educational model to Harlem, provided office space and quietly rallied support in the community, Mr. Perry said.Its important to note it was he who inspired our team to come in and expand into New York, Mr. Perry said. It starts there, and the rest of the role will develop over time.The school is set to open for the 2016-17 school year, with 160 students in sixth and seventh grades. School officials said it would expand one grade per year, eventually enrolling 700 students in grades six through 12. It is currently accepting applications for students and staff members.Mr. Perry said that he initially resisted Mr. Combss suggestion of opening another school  suggesting an after-school program or a scholarship instead  but that Mr. Combs was adamant.I think that theres a lot to be found in the fact that you have someone such as Combs, who is highly visible within our community, who has decided that his major push is going to be with our model and in education, Mr. Perry said.Last year, Mr. Combs was arrested on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon  a kettlebell  after an altercation at the Acosta Athletic Training Complex of University of California, Los Angeles, where his son is a member of the football team. No one was seriously injured, and the charge was later dropped."}

The Argentine Foreign Ministry said its waters had increased by 0.66 million square miles, and the decision will be important in its dispute with Britain over the islands. The United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf sided with Argentina this month, ratifying the countrys 2009 report fixing the limit of its territory at 200 to 350 miles from its coast.

{"text": "There is an interminable discussion going on about tone.Did Hillary Clinton strike the correct tone? Should Donald Trump be praised or scorned for the tone of his rallies? Was President Obama tone-deaf in Buenos Aires when he danced the tango while Brussels burned (this after setting a new diplomatic tone in Cuba)?Somebody alert the tone police. The campaign tone has been, every time you think weve hit a low, it goes lower, the moderator Chuck Todd of Meet the Press lamented on Sunday. We must be ever-vigilant about tone. Its easier than assessing substance and safer than casting blame.This weeks breaking tone news comes to us from Politico: Clinton Campaign: Future Debates Depend Upon Sanderss Tone. It seems Clintons chief campaign strategist, Joel Benenson, went on CNN on Monday morning and put Sanders on tone probation. If Sanders wants Clinton on a debate stage, Benenson suggested, hed better, you know, watch it. Lets see the tone of the campaign, Benenson said. Lets see if he goes back to the kind of tone he said he was going to set early on. If he does that, then well talk about the debates. Maybe we should just forget the whole election and put all the candidates before a tribunal of cable pundits who will judge their tones. Whoever sets the best tone wins.The Clinton campaign may be especially sensitive to matters of tone; no candidate has had their tone critiqued like Clinton has, from gendered accusations of shrillness to blame for the pitch of how people react to her, for better or worse (she is, after all, polarizing). But still: When did campaigns become so obsessed with tone? George W. Bush spoke hopefully about changing the tone in Washington. Obama did too. They both failed. The tone of our politics is not, doesnt reflect, I think, whats best in us, Obama said in Argentina last week.Now everyone seems to be evaluating every little thing through the prism of tone. Theres the search, for instance, for signs that Trump will soon be shifting his tone to engender a friendlier and more inclusive persona. This came on the heels of Trumps campaign events taking on an increasingly menacing tone, marked by violence, threats and chaos. (Trump told CNN he should get credit, not be scorned, for the tone of his rallies.)Last week, CBS News and The New York Times released a poll in which 60 percent of Republican primary voters said they were embarrassed by the tone of their partys presidential campaign. The survey was conducted before Melania Trump and Heidi Cruz became part of the loony tones.The nasty tone of politics is not new. Nor are objections to it. Theres always someone on TV or in a campaign claiming to be deeply troubled or saddened over the tone of this or that (being deeply troubled or saddened always pays well). It seems worse in 2016. Every day we are being told the tone has sunk lower  and it probably has.But heres a theory on why everyones dwelling so much on tone: Its safe. The concept assigns no blame. A quasi-dispassionate TV pundit can step back and object to the tone of a debate or a campaign without saying exactly who polluted it (most discussions of tone involve someone stepping back.) You can bemoan the ugly tone of a campaign without actually saying that, for instance, Trump might deserve the most blame for making it so.Tone is a graveyard conceit and a crutch. Its using the cop-out description of the electorate as angry and frustrated without naming the dark forces that might be driving that anger and frustration. Its easy to stay above the fray when you are calling for an elevated tone. To be more precise is to risk entering the fray.Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, delivered a high-minded speech last week criticizing the tone of the Republican primary campaign. Politics can be a battle of ideas, not insults, Ryan said. It can be about solutions. It can be about making a difference. He called for vigilance. He was stepping back. He did not mention Trump."}
{"text": "With all the right fanfare, the celebrated dance-rock act LCD Soundsystem called it quits in 2011. There was the momentous farewell announcement; a run of sold-out shows, including a three-hour-plus spectacle at Madison Square Garden; and a documentary, Shut Up and Play the Hits, chronicling the heartache with which the frontman, James Murphy, decided to step away from the stage, seemingly forever.But we are living in the reboot era, and so, on Sunday, scarcely five years after LCD Soundsystem broke up, it played its first reunion show, at Webster Hall in the East Village, with another on Monday. The performances were in preparation for the groups headlining set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival next month, and they were a surprise, announced only three days before. Tickets were awarded via lottery, connections and luck, and even this warm-up bill was treated as a seminal event by music industry insiders and exuberant fans. As electronic dance music, or E.D.M., rules the airwaves and LCDs disco-punk sound seems more prescient than ever, the revival was largely embraced, even if it was also a foregone conclusion.I knew they were lying about disbanding, said David Schoonmaker, a longtime fan who came to Webster Hall in a homemade LCD baseball cap. Mr. Schoonmaker, 47, who works in health care advertising, said the bands short retirement was just long enough: They didnt need more than five years to prove to people that theyre still magical.Mr. Murphy didnt seem so sure. This is very weird, he said, a few songs in, after greeting the crowd. (Its been a hot minute.) In a rambly letter explaining the comeback, posted on the bands website, he had acknowledged that some fans might feel betrayed by its quick reversal, so he thanked everyone, too, a lot. We are humbled by your enthusiasm and kindness, he said, adding, Thank you guys for doing whatever you had to do to be here.The group, which performed as a seven-piece and includes Nancy Whang on keys and Pat Mahoney on drums, has promised new music  an album is due this year. But the two-hour set was entirely old material, including an updated Daft Punk Is Playing at My House: Pharrells in the band now, Mr. Murphy deadpanned.His acute self-awareness has always been part of the appeal; LCDs first single, Losing My Edge, released in 2002, offered a wry take on indie-rock cooler-than-thou-ness, and it found an eager audience in the music blogosphere. Pitchfork, which streamed and posted Snapchats from Sundays show, had at least three correspondents there, live-blogging by minute: 11:57 p.m.: Murphy is face down on the snare drum, singing into the mic.But the crowd mostly came to move; even through some technical difficulties caused by an errant keyboard controller, the capacity audience throbbed under an oversized disco ball that lit up on cue during Us v Them.I prepared with all my flying colors, to emulate all the joy I feel inside, said Annie Garneva, 26, who wore a sequined top and silver shoes, and pink-and-blue leggings printed with trees. From the opening song, Get Innocuous!, the floor bounced under all the pogoers. Mr. Murphy, who ditched his trademark black jacket almost immediately as he roamed the stage, chimed in on snares and cowbells, and repeatedly dropped to his knees to fix errant gear.Ms. Garneva, a Brooklynite who works at a nonprofit organization, said she once saw Mr. Murphy on the street in Williamsburg, and I screamed that I loved him. For her, the band expresses the fundamental and natural parts of being human  just being anxious or confused or loving, and how you can be all those things at the same time, she said.Audience members, who ranged from their 20s to their 50s, seemed split between LCD dance floor newbies and veterans, and included some boldface names, like Aziz Ansari and Spike Jonze. The art dealer Jeffrey Deitch, who once employed Ms. Whang as a gallery assistant, estimated that he had seen the group 30 times. Theyre the greatest contemporary band to come out of New York, he said.Tickets on the secondary market were going for upward of $500. I spent two-and-a-half days having an anxiety attack and talking to scalpers online, said Reinhardt Wende, 27, a nurse, who arrived with hundreds in cash for a ticket but got a tip that the band was selling extras at a nearby bar, and spent only $40. Amman Badlani, 37, who works in digital marketing, was even luckier: After an hour and a half standing outside with a sign pleading for tickets, he was spotted by the bands tour manager and swept inside, on orders from Mr. Murphy.The way Stephen Sondheim is Mr. New York for a general audience, James Murphy is Mr. New York for a very niche audience, said Kat Ryals, 28, an artist, and Brooklyn transplant from Nashville.In the five years that LCD was on hiatus, its bandmates branched out into other projects and managed DFA Records, its label. Mr. Murphy, 46, an in-demand producer and D.J., also dabbled: he cooked; he created a craft coffee line; opened a wine bar; and promoted his long-held vision of making the subway turnstiles play a tune.But Mr. Murphy said he was overflowing with song ideas and missed his band, and besides, hes keyed into the pleasures of supply and demand. If we do it again, Im going to freak out, he sang. So do it again.Even for the encore, there was no pretense of coyness. Whether you clap or not, were going to come back, he teased. And they did, to do two of their most beloved songs, Dance Yrself Clean and All My Friends.Minus the technical difficulties, it was everything I wanted it to be and more, Chase Dominick, 28, a TV producer, said after the show. He discovered the band only after it disappeared, and had gotten in to the gig through a roommate who works at the Four Horsemen, Mr. Murphys wine bar. Im really glad theyre back, he said. We need them.In gritty-turned-glossy Williamsburg, where Mr. Dominick lives, theyre folk heroes, he explained, reminders of what the scene was about: not giving all the right damns."}

{"text": "THE casual consumer of campus-related news might be forgiven for assuming that anti-Semitic intimidation is breaking out all over. Where I teach, at Brooklyn College of the City University of New York, arguments over a proposed event or demonstration regarding Israel and Palestine appear every few months, and sometimes turn ugly.In 2013, some Jewish students were forced out of a lecture sponsored by Students for Justice in Palestine. Just recently, a few members of the same organization broke up a faculty council meeting with demands that included barring Zionists from the campus.In both cases, the culprits were appropriately and unambiguously condemned by the Brooklyn College president, Karen Gould. And while circumstances vary, controversies over the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel, or B.D.S. for short, have taken place recently at Brown, Oberlin, Vassar and the University of California, among others.At private colleges and universities, pressure to suppress pro-boycott activities is usually administered quietly by donors or alumni and rarely makes the news. But at publicly funded institutions, boycott-related arguments often inspire politicians to try to legislate punishment if the school refuses to shut them down.The battle for free speech on campus won two victories last week. First, the University of California rejected part of a draft report by the state regents that explicitly equated anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism in its condemnation of the latter.Second, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has apparently reconsidered his original idea to cut $485 million from the CUNY budget a budget that the Senate Republican majority passed in a surprise session March 14 as a way to send a message to CUNY to take a harder line regarding what it considers to be the universitys anti-Semitism problem.Anti-Semitism is no doubt a problem on many college campuses. And the boycott Israel movement  which has inspired these arguments  is tainted with it. I have long been a vocal B.D.S. opponent at CUNY and helped to found a national organization of academics to fight it, and Ive experienced the nastiness firsthand. Still, as obnoxious as some of its followers can be, the boycott movement on campus is thriving not because of, but in spite of, the anti-Semitism of some of its adherents.Indeed, it is filled with young Jews. The pro-boycott group Jewish Voice for Peace is perhaps the fastest-growing Jewish organization on campuses nationwide. And many liberal Zionists share the movements complaints about the brutality and self-defeating nature of Israels nearly 50-year occupation, even if they believe B.D.S. language and tactics to be counterproductive to the goal of a peaceful, two-state solution  to say nothing of the movements contravention of principles of free expression.This is what happened to CUNY, with that surprise session initiated by Republicans in the State Senate. As was the case with the California regents, a single Jewish organization was behind the anti-CUNY campaign. In California, it was the Amcha Initiative, one of whose founders was quoted in this newspaper over the weekend explaining that B.D.S. is in virtually all of its aspects anti-Semitic. With CUNY, it was the far-right Zionist Organization of America making the same argument. These accusations of anti-Semitism were then magnified by conservative columnists and repeated by the Republican state senators.But contrary to what the state senators claimed, CUNY administrators did not ignore the accusations. They hired two former federal prosecutors to examine the complaints of anti-Semitism and recommend appropriate action. CUNY has also established a working group to go over its policies relating to the boundaries of acceptable speech. Abraham Foxman, the former director of the Anti-Defamation League and an alumnus of CUNY, has praised the universitys handling of these isolated incidents. And, to borrow a phrase, when it comes to anti-Semitism, if Abe Foxman is not worried, Im not worried.Moreover, the notion that the people behind the worst of this behavior are anything but a loud and obnoxious minority is belied by the reality of everyday life on campus. Aside from Facebook and Twitter posts, where anonymity often invites abuse, Ive never heard a single anti-Semitic syllable uttered on any CUNY campus in the dozen years Ive been on the faculty. My classes on Jewish history and culture often discuss extremely delicate questions of Jewish identity without anyone, Jew or gentile, evincing the slightest discernible discomfort. (Well, one traditionally Orthodox undergraduate once called Woody Allen and Philip Roth worse than the goyim.)The notion that politicians can demand that a university prohibit certain types of political speech it finds politically distasteful by threatening its funding not only makes martyrs of those whom it seeks to silence, it also bespeaks a lack of confidence both in its own beliefs and in the value of reason itself.The rabbinic sage Yossi Ben Zimra would recognize these campaigns as so much motzira-making, or malicious gossip. Regarding CUNY, Id call it shameful to see such tactics deployed against so proud and significant an institution in the history of American Jews, and now an invaluable educational lifeline to millions of recent immigrants and hardworking, largely low-income students.By protecting the right to free speech and expression, while simultaneously demanding civility and respectful discourse on all sides, universities can take care of these problems without political threats that undermine the very purpose of the university itself."}
{"text": "Finger blood tests from Theranos, the medical start-up, produced more irregular results than conventional tests offered by the nations two largest clinical laboratories, researchers reported Monday in the first published independent assessment of the companys tests.Theranos also came up with no answer at all for 2.2 percent of the measurements requested, something that virtually never happened with the two other labs, Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp.The results, published in The Journal of Clinical Investigation, are not entirely negative. By and large, Theranoss measurements agreed with those of the other labs, and cost much less. Still, the study is almost certain to raise more doubts about the companys assertion that it had found a way to revolutionize medical testing.On Thursday, Theranos sent a letter to the journal, hoping to stop it from publishing the paper. The letter, signed by Theranoss laboratory directors, called the study flawed and inaccurate and added, We are disappointed that any journal would accept this study for publication.Theranos has attracted huge attention for saying that it could perform numerous blood tests at very low cost using a few drops of blood from a finger rather than the usual tubes of blood drawn from a vein in the arm. The news media swooned over Elizabeth Holmes, who dropped out of Stanford to start Theranos and now, at age 32, is a billionaire on paper.But articles in The Wall Street Journal and regulatory actions have challenged the companys claims. Federal regulators in January cited Theranos for several deficiencies, including one that posed immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety.Theranos is no longer doing much finger-prick testing, pending regulatory approvals.The new study, by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, was conducted for the most part last July, before the questions about Theranos arose.The study involved 60 healthy adult volunteers, each of whom was tested twice in the same day at two separate walk-in Theranos sites in the Phoenix area.For Quest and LabCorp, the volunteers had blood drawn from their arms immediately before the first Theranos visit and again immediately after the second one.They were tested for 22 measures, including various types of cholesterol and a complete blood count. The tests did not include one for the clotting ability of blood, the one Theranos executives say regulators cited as posing a threat to patients.While most of the results were similar for the three labs, 12.2 percent of the measurements reported by Theranos were outside the expected normal range for healthy people, compared with 7.5 percent for Quest and 8.3 percent for LabCorp.Theranos was out of range more often for lymphocytes, which are types of white blood cells; for a measure of hemoglobin; and for certain types of cholesterol. But Quest and LabCorp also differed from each other in some instances.Theres actually pretty widespread variability in these clinical measures, even between the reference labs, said Eric Schadt, chairman of genetics and genomic sciences at the Icahn School and an author of the report. But Theranos was more outside of range and outside of range in ways that would impact clinical decision-making.In their letter to the journal and in an interview, Theranos executives said that just because a result was out of the normal range did not mean it was wrong. There was no attempt made by the studys authors to determine which measurement was correct.For instance, for LDL cholesterol, both Theranos and LabCorp reported results out of the normal range for many of the same people, while Quest reported normal levels for them.Theranos executives also said that taking a big draw of blood from a vein immediately before a finger prick was not standard practice. They said that affected the finger prick samples in a way that made it difficult to return a reading.Still, some experts not involved in the study said it was done reasonably well.This represents just another effort for a failing company to cover up bad press for a technology that is not ready for prime time, Dr. Frederick L. Kiechle, medical director for clinical pathology at Memorial Healthcare System in Hollywood, Fla., said about Theranoss letter to the journal.Dr. Kiechle said it was known that cells in blood tend to clump together and travel in groups, so the tiny amount collected from a finger prick might not be representative.Greg Miller, professor of pathology and director of clinical chemistry at Virginia Commonwealth University, said the discrepancies in cholesterol results were medically meaningful and suggested that Theranos had not properly calibrated its tests to an industry standard.Dr. Schadt said the study was done because his genetics group wanted to see whether Theranos testing could be used as a low-cost way to periodically monitor the health of people. Theranos charged only $33 for the 22 measurements, about a fifth the cost at the two other labs.The researchers did not tell Theranos about the study, wanting it to be a real world test of the service.In December, however, Dr. Schadt tried to contact a Theranos executive through LinkedIn to ask some questions. He said he got no reply. Theranos says it has no record of being contacted.Theranos has been criticized for not publishing data on its own in peer-reviewed journals. A spokeswoman said there would be such publications in the coming months.Dr. Schadt said he was surprised that his group of genetics researchers, rather than the company or laboratory scientists, was the first to publish such a study.You would have thought that it wouldnt be left to groups like mine to flesh that out, he said."}

{"text": "Duncan Clark is known in Beijing as a savvy commentator on Chinas rapidly morphing tech world. A British citizen who first came to China in 1994, he learned the language and stayed for two decades. His background as an investment banker specializing in telecommunications at Morgan Stanley in London and Hong Kong helped him understand in the mid-1990s that the China market was about to take off.Mr. Clark opened a consultancy firm, BDA, which helped raise money for the major telecom operators China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom. One of the most interesting characters he encountered, Mr. Clark said, was Jack Ma, in the early days of Alibaba, the e-commerce giant Mr. Ma founded. That insider view infuses Mr. Clarks book Alibaba: The House Jack Ma Built, to be published in April. In an interview, Mr. Clark discussed Alibabas phenomenal growth, Mr. Mas emergence as a public figure and what sets Mr. Ma apart from the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.Q. You once described Jack Ma as someone who likes to cultivate the persona of an outsize personality. Isnt there a risk in having too high a profile in China and being taken down?A. Executives who say or do the wrong thing are always at risk. I titled the last chapter of my book Icon or Icarus.Sure, he has an outsize personality and a large public following, but he has been careful not to fall foul of the authorities. If anything, he has positioned Alibaba as a useful ally as the government attempts to put Chinese consumers in the driving seat. Spend more, save less is the new mantra. This wont happen overnight. Shedding the old economic model centered on manufacturing, construction and exports will take time and require complex and painful reforms. Alibaba, and the power of the Internet, are shiny objects that the government can point to.Q. Alibaba has been working in recent years to reorganize and become more efficient. All tech start-ups go through growing pains. How severe are those pains at Alibaba right now?A. Alibaba was founded 17 years ago, employs over 38,000 people, and is a listed company on the NYSE. It has experienced lots of ups and downs, both as a private and a public company, and gone through many reorganizations. Alibaba is more of a commerce company than a tech company, although its future is increasingly one in which technology plays a leading role. Jack himself does not have a tech background and unlike, say, Robin Li at Baidu, he has had to defer to colleagues who do.After a few years of piecemeal international expansion  including a failed attempt to launch its own consumer-facing site in the U.S.  Jack last year brought in former Goldman Sachs banker Michael Evans to oversee its global footprint, with new offices on the East Coast of the U.S. and across Europe.Q. Ma started out as an outspoken, slightly goofy businessman. Now he is attending major political events like the China Development Forum  which is a major way for Beijing to promote China. Has he chosen to go into politics of his own free will, or has he allowed himself to be co-opted as a matter of survival?A. Even before he founded Alibaba, Jack was a regular speaker at conferences at home and abroad. His public appearances have been critical for him to grow and maintain his profile. He is the ultimate performer, his folksy charm and seemingly impossible ambitions as effective in English as in Chinese.Before he founded Alibaba, his third venture, Jack worked as a civil servant in Beijing, giving him valuable insights into the intersection of business and politics in China. This is crucial as he expands his empire beyond e-commerce into areas such as finance. The process isnt smooth however: Jack has already encountered powerful vested interests such as opposition from state-owned banks alarmed by the rapid growth of his money market fund or plans for an online bank.Q. Is Alibaba, whose business depends heavily on private vendors using it to sell their wares, really committed to getting rid of counterfeit products as demanded by the Chinese State Administration for Industry and Commerce (S.A.I.C.)?A. Fakes and unscrupulous traders are part and parcel of commerce. In China, as in the U.S., there are people who actively seek out fakes, people who are unwilling or unable to pay for the real thing.Simply moving trading online doesnt eliminate the problem, but it has created tensions between S.A.I.C., the brand owners who suffer from piracy and operators of e-commerce platforms like Alibaba. The short-lived, but very public, spat with S.A.I.C. in January 2015 illustrated that Alibaba has no choice but to step up its efforts to root out fakes on its platforms: to help the government do its job.Alibaba became famous for Taobao, the platform where small merchants or individuals sell a wide range of third-party products  including fake products, especially in the early days. Merchants who pass off fake products as real can expect to see their store ratings and business suffer. Alibaba can also shut down the Alipay accounts of repeat offenders, and use big data to analyze trading patterns.But Alibabas success hangs increasingly on another platform, Tmall, where brand owners sell their own  real  products, or via large retailers, directly to consumers. Taobao was vital to Alibabas past success. Tmall is the key to its future, as Alibaba generates a commission on every sale. By contrast, on Taobao, Alibaba relies purely on advertising revenue.Q. Alibaba seems to be buying into new areas that could be considered vanity projects, or projects that assist the Chinese government with soft power. Hollywood and The South China Morning Post, the Hong Kong English-language newspaper, are two examples. How much of Mas desire for promoting China is involved in these projects?A. The relatively small  $200 million  purchase of The South China Morning Post will do little to move the needle for Alibabas business, raising the question of why the company felt inclined to buy it in the first place. In explaining the purchase, Alibaba vice chairman Joe Tsai vowed to protect the newspapers editorial independence. Yet he also voiced frustration at how China is portrayed in Western media. While Alibaba is unlikely to use the paper as a vehicle for promoting itself, it faces an uphill struggle to convince skeptics that it made the purchase for reasons other than helping the Chinese government project its influence in the territory.Q. How would you describe the differences in entrepreneurial style between Mark Zuckerberg and Jack Ma? Do you think Facebook, which is now blocked, will enter the China market?A. Jack is an entrepreneurs entrepreneur: Hes not a tech guy, he didnt go to Harvard, he even once supplemented his income as an English teacher by buying and selling plastic carpets on the streets. Mark Zuckerberg has a tech background, who leveraged that and good timing while at Harvard to build a massive and almost global social business.But China will likely remain beyond Facebooks grasp. China has hardly stood still without Facebook: Tencents WeChat is a dominant player in China already, superior in some important ways to Facebook especially in mobile. No doubt Jack and Zuckerberg have explored how they might work together, not least because Tencent is a formidable competitor to Alibaba in social and mobile.But to enter China, Facebook would have to water down its local product, or de-link it from the rest of the world  which risks alienating customers and the U.S. government. Its hard to see how Facebook can square the circle. But that doesnt mean that Mark Zuckerberg wont keep on trying."}

{"text": "Ram and Geeta Chandran had always planned to move into a senior community after they retired. The couple had no children, and we knew we had to move to a retirement community so we wouldnt be lonely in a huge house, said Geeta Chandran, 72, a family physician.Then they came across an online ad for ShantiNiketan, a planned 55-plus community in Tavares, Fla., designed for Indian-Americans. (The name, in Sanskrit, means peaceful home.)The Chandrans, who had emigrated from India in 1970, found the prospect of aging with others from their home country appealing.Indian immigrants who came to the United States in the 1960s and 70s for educational and work opportunities have begun to downsize and contemplate their postcareer years, said Iggy Ignatius, 60, ShantiNiketans chairman. Many people were thinking theyd go back to India, but pragmatically, its not possible, he said. Our children are here. Our grandchildren are here.In Florida, from the architecture that reminds Dr. Chandran of Chennai, India, to the vegetarian meals and Bollywood dance classes, we have created a mini-India, a piece of India, Mr. Ignatius said.The Chandrans moved into their three-bedroom condominium in 2011, paying $250,000, and now they lead yoga classes in ShantiNiketans meditation room.Mr. Chandran, 77, a former corporate vice president, conducts Hindu prayers each weekday morning in a small on-site temple. For festivals, Dr. Chandran puts on the silk saris she found few occasions to wear in Newport News, Va.You feel more at home here, she said.Developers call these kinds of housing options affinity group communities, said Robert G. Kramer, chief executive of the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care, an industry research group.In addition to those established by and for members of religious groups, they include retirement communities for military officers, for gays and lesbians, and for the alumni of particular colleges and universities.Facilities for specific ethnic groups have appeared more recently, but I think well see more of them, Mr. Kramer said. Were such a polyglot culture.Among those already in operation: Aegis Gardens, a 64-unit Chinese-American assisted living complex in Fremont, Calif., opened in 2001. With a staff that speaks Mandarin and Cantonese, daily tai chi sessions and a Chinese chef, it maintains nearly 100 percent occupancy, said Dwayne Clark, the chief executive of Aegis Living.So the company, which operates 30 assisted living facilities on the West Coast, is building a second Chinese-American facility, a $50 million independent living, assisted living and memory care campus in Newcastle, Wash., scheduled to open next year.Monthly rents are likely to start at $5,300, executives said, not including help with the activities of daily living. ShantiNiketan began with 54 apartments when the Chandrans moved in. Now it has 174, with 120 more condos for Indian-Americans under construction, and Mr. Ignatius plans an initial public offering to finance similar developments near Los Angeles, Dallas and Chicago. Dr. Mukund Thakar began creating Indian-American floors in New Jersey nursing homes a decade ago, hiring Indian physicians, nurses, aides and dietitians. His Indian Nursing Home program now operates in eight facilities around the state and one in the Bronx. In Queens, a small nonprofit group called India Home runs culturally appropriate senior center programs for South Asian immigrants. The Desi Senior Center in Jamaica, Queens, for example, attracts older Bangladeshis with hot halal lunches, English instruction and a screen separating men from women in exercise classes.Theres a Catholic Charities senior center two blocks away, but they would not go there, because nobody on the staff speaks Bengali, said Lakshman Kalasapudi, India Homes program manager.As for Latinos, I expect to see the first Hispanic facilities in Southern California and the Southwest, said Mr. Kramer of the National Investment Center.For years, New Old Age readers from other countries have insisted that their cultures revere elders and revile children who dont care for their parents in multigenerational homes. But even in those societies, where elder care frequently depended on the unpaid labor of women, demographic and socioeconomic shifts have made a difference. Nursing homes have sprouted across China, for instance.Though Chinese-American families (like most American families) try to keep older relatives at home as long as possible, a lot of my residents have said its very lonely if your children are at work, your grandchildren are at school, and youre alone with a caregiver, dozing in front of the TV, said Emily Poon, the general manager of Aegis Gardens in Fremont.In standard assisted living, they might feel even more disconnected. The majority cant speak English well, Ms. Poon said. They couldnt communicate effectively with the staff or the other residents. They might find the food unpalatable, the activities unengaging. Isolation breeds its own physical and psychological dangers.Alice and George Louie, 90-year-old Chinese immigrants, moved to Aegis Gardens in 2012 to be near their daughter and son-in-law. The staff helps Mr. Louie, who has dementia, with his medications. Mrs. Louie, who has diabetes and uses a walker, practices tai chi and calligraphy. They eat meals with other Cantonese speakers.For the Chinese New Year, you never saw a place so extravagantly decorated, Mrs. Louie said. The festivities included traditional lion dancers, jugglers and gymnasts; the dining room served dim sum.For administrators, ethnic facilities can pose special challenges. Aegis executives had to petition to change the Fremont communitys street address, Mr. Clark said, because it contained the numeral 4, considered unlucky in Chinese culture. Inside the facility, apartment numbers jump from 103 to 105 and 239 to 251.Days before the opening, a feng shui practitioner decreed that the fountain in the courtyard be torn out because its outer rim contained points; he was mollified when workers hastily sawed off the points.A larger challenge: How long will the market for ethnically specific senior housing and programs last? Immigrants more assimilated offspring may care less about traditional cooking or a Gujarati-speaking staff. For first-generation Indians, this is working out great, Mr. Ignatius said of ShantiNiketan. Im not sure my children will come here.But if the need 40 years hence looks uncertain, the demand right now is pressing, said Dr. Vasundhara Kalasapudi, the executive director of India Home. The group wants to establish day programs for South Asians with dementia, as well as assisted living facilities and nursing homes.This is a common topic for all of us, how difficult it is to take care of families with medical problems, she said.Or nonmedical problems. Dr. Kalasapudi, a geriatric psychiatrist, recalled being pressed into service to talk to a hospitalized Indian immigrant who suffered, the staff believed, from depression. Her mother tongue was Telugu, but they managed to communicate in Hindi.Im not depressed, the patient told her. I just dont like the food."}

It was a home run. At one point last summer, when Valeants stock was trading at $250 a share, ValueActs return on its stake was a whopping 2,100 percent. And it was proud of Valeants deal-driven, slash-and-burn strategy: We believed extraordinary value could be created not from a traditional strategy of high-risk R&D bets but rather from a focus on operational excellence, cost control and asset divestitures, ValueAct said in glowing support of the company back in 2009.But that was then.Today, Valeants shares are down about 88 percent from their high of last summer in the face of questions about the companys accounting, the ouster of Mr. Pearson and a scuffle inside the boardroom that led to a director being asked to resign, a request the director refused. Oh, and the company is being investigated by Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission.ValueAct, amazingly, is still in the black, having bought much of its stake in Valeant at an average share price of $11.Last June, ValueAct sold about $1 billion worth of Valeant shares only months before the companys troubles surfaced. Under securities laws, insiders are held to a very strict policy about when they can sell since they are privy to the companys internal records and plans. No one has accused ValueAct of selling its shares with knowledge of the companys impending downfall, and there is no reason to believe that was the case.ValueAct described the sale of shares last summer as a standard portfolio transaction.We have owned Valeant shares for over nine years and have sold shares on three previous occasions for the same portfolio management purposes, it said in a statement at the time. After this sale, our investment in Valeant will continue to be well in excess of $3 billion and will be one of the largest investments in our funds.But ValueAct, given its presence on the board and long relationship with Valeant, had to be aware of the companys use of a mail-order pharmacy, Philidor, as a way around the efforts of pharmacies and insurance companies to sell lower-priced generic drugs instead of Valeants high-priced brand-name drugs. That practice has come under scrutiny and led, in large part, to Valeants current crisis.Valeant declined to make Mr. Ubben available to comment. In fairness to him, he is at a disadvantage as far as defending himself publicly because most company lawyers prevent insiders from speaking out.It is hard to see how ValueAct wouldnt have been aware of some of Valeants more aggressive strategies, unless it intended to claim that it was duped by management, a claim it has yet to make. Indeed, even though ValueActs representative, Mason Morfit, had stepped down from the board (before returning after the crisis hit), Mr. Pearson said in a statement last fall: Although Mason has not officially been a part of the Valeant Board for more than a year, I have continued to value his vision and guidance, and I believe his insights will be invaluable during this time.It was Mr. Morfit, among others on the board, who helped put in place a compensation plan for Mr. Pearson and other managers that some governance experts say may have led to Valeants aggressive approach, both with its use of Philidor and with its accounting practices, which have now come under scrutiny.Mr. Pearsons compensation plan, once heralded as a model for paying for performance, was tied directly to the success of the companys stock price. Mr. Pearson needed to reach certain thresholds of performance to be paid or he would get nothing beyond his salary. And last year, Mr. Pearsons salary was slashed to zero to make him even more dependent on the performance model, so he was completely focused on his incentive bonus.The stock needed to go up at least 15 percent annually over at least three years for his bonus shares to vest. If the stock went up 45 percent, Mr. Pearson would be paid three times as much. By last summer, Mr. Pearson was worth about $3 billion on paper.We richly reward for outstanding T.S.R. performance, the company said in a filing, referring to total shareholder return, but pay significantly less for below-average T.S.R. performance. It acknowledged that its formula meant the companys executives could be among the best-paid in the industry.That might have sounded good in theory. Who doesnt want their executives pay directly tied to the companys performance? Unlike those in so many companies, Valeants compensation structure meant that Mr. Pearson would do well only if the shareholders did too. None of the heads you win, tails you win too chicanery that has led to such skepticism about compensation at public companies.But it meant that Mr. Pearson and his team needed the stock to keep going up. And that may have led to a culture that was too aggressive.All along, ValueAct was there. The firms managers may not have been operating the company day to day, nor making some of the decisions that led to the current crisis of confidence. But it happened on their watch, under a chief executive they championed. At a minimum, ValueAct tacitly endorsed Valeants strategy. And now, ValueAct is stuck holding the shares, unable to sell them given its insider status and all the continuing investigations.While ValueActs investors may still look at Valeant as a profitable trade, they might want to give the company the kind of scrutiny ValueAct failed to give Valeant."}

{"text": "Patty Duke, who died on Tuesday at 69, overcame a painful childhood to become one of the best-known young actors in the world. After appearing in commercials and a few television shows as a child, she found fame on Broadway, starring with Anne Bancroft in William Gibsons The Miracle Worker. The play, about Helen Keller and her teacher, Anne Sullivan, ran from 1959 to 1961. Ms. Duke reprised the role in the 1962 film version of The Miracle Worker, which Bosley Crowther praised in The Times for retaining the plays absolutely tremendous and unforgettable display of physically powerful acting. Ms. Duke won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the performance  at 16, she was then the youngest actor to win that award.Ms. Duke returned to television for The Patty Duke Show, an era-defining sitcom of the more outwardly wholesome early 1960s. Ms. Duke played, as the infectious theme song put it, cousins, identical cousins: Patty, a fun-loving stereotypical American girl from Brooklyn Heights, and Cathy, a prim young lady from Scotland.The show, created by Sidney Sheldon (I Dream of Jeannie, Hart to Hart), featured celebrity guest stars including Frankie Avalon, Sal Mineo, Paul Lynde and Sammy Davis Jr. and ran from 1963 to 1966.Ms. Dukes next move telegraphed a desire to leave her child-actor past behind. She starred as a debauched singer in the film Valley of the Dolls in 1967, based on the Jacqueline Susann novel about good girls going bad and the perils of Hollywood.This time, Mr. Crowther was not as charmed. Its an unbelievably hackneyed and mawkish mish-mash of backstage plots and Peyton Place adumbrations in which five women are involved with their assorted egotistical aspirations, love affairs and Seconal pills, he wrote.Ms. Duke returned to television in the 1970s and would spend the next couple of decades starring mostly in TV movies, including as Anne Sullivan in The Miracle Worker, and the occasional feature film. In the 1982 she returned to sitcoms with It Takes Two, a topical comedy about the modern challenges that face a hard-charging, career-minded couple, also starring Richard Crenna.She also began working to raise money and awareness for mental health issues after being diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the 1980s.Though her celebrity peaked early, Ms. Duke suggested late in her career that she was more proud of her professionalism rather than past fame.Im proud that when I get a job, Im gonna give you what you paid for, she said in a 2013 interview. And maybe even more."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON   The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued an unusual order indicating that the justices are trying to avoid a 4-to-4 deadlock in a case pitting religious freedom against access to contraception.The order, which was unsigned, directed the parties to file supplemental briefs in Zubik v. Burwell, No. 14-1418, which was argued on Wednesday. The case was brought by religious groups that object to providing insurance coverage for contraception to their female workers.Women are guaranteed access to that coverage under the Affordable Care Act. After the religious groups said paying for such insurance made them complicit in sin, the Obama administration offered the groups an accommodation: If they object in writing and provide information about their insurance plans, the administration said, insurance companies and the government will pay for the coverage.At Wednesdays arguments, several justices indicated that they thought the accommodation violated the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act because it allowed the government to hijack the insurance plans of the religious groups that are the petitioners in the case.Tuesdays order asked the parties to address whether and how contraceptive coverage may be obtained by petitioners employees through petitioners insurance companies, but in a way that does not require any involvement of petitioners beyond their own decision to provide health insurance without contraceptive coverage to their employees.The order sketched out how this might work, asking the two sides to address whether it would be acceptable for the groups to do no more than to buy insurance plans for their workers that do not include contraception coverage.Petitioners would have no legal obligation to provide such contraceptive coverage, would not pay for such coverage and would not be required to submit any separate notice to their insurer, to the federal government or to their employees, the order said. At the same time, petitioners insurance company  aware that petitioners are not providing certain contraceptive coverage on religious grounds  would separately notify petitioners employees that the insurance company will provide cost-free contraceptive coverage, and that such coverage is not paid for by petitioners and is not provided through petitioners health plan.It is not particularly unusual for the court to ask for supplemental briefs, but Tuesdays order was exceptionally elaborate and seemed to envision new regulations from the Department of Health and Human Services. It was almost certainly prompted, at least in part, by a desire to avoid a tie, which would automatically affirm the four appeals court decisions under review, all of which upheld the existing accommodation.Were the court to deadlock, religious groups in different parts of the country would have conflicting obligations if they objected to covering contraception because one federal appeals court has struck down the accommodation.The parties may address other proposals along similar lines, the order said. The first briefs are due April 12."}

{"text": "By every conventional measure, Jessica Knolls thriller, Luckiest Girl Alive, was a wildly successful literary debut. It sold more than 450,000 copies and spent four months on the best-seller lists. Foreign rights sold in more than 30 countries. The actress Reese Witherspoon optioned the film rights, and Ms. Knoll wrote the screenplay.Still, Ms. Knoll couldnt escape the nagging feeling that she had let her readers down. Even though her book was fiction, she felt she hadnt fully told the truth.The white lie she told over and over, at readings and book signings and in interviews, was complicated and hard to untangle. She assured fans that some of the darker elements of her novel, which centers on a successful young woman who struggles with the lingering trauma of a sexual assault, were purely fiction. She deflected questions from readers who wanted to know how she had managed to portray a rape and its aftermath so vividly and realistically, saying she had heard stories from friends and classmates.She is no longer dodging those questions. On Tuesday, Ms. Knoll published a raw and chilling essay describing how the gang rape depicted in her novel was drawn from her own experience in high school, when she was sexually assaulted by three boys at a party, and then tormented by classmates who labeled her a slut.I was so conditioned to not talk about it that it didnt even occur to me to be forthcoming, Ms. Knoll said during a recent interview at her publishers office in Midtown Manhattan. I want to make people feel like they can talk about it, like they dont have to be ashamed of it.In the essay, published on Lenny, a newsletter and website for young women, Ms. Knoll described how some of the most harrowing and horrific scenes in her novel came from her fragmented memories of a party that went devastatingly wrong: blacking out and then regaining consciousness when a boy was assaulting her; waking up later in a bathroom, seeing a toilet bowl of blood-tinged water, and not understanding where it came from; finding herself in a strange bed the next morning beside a different boy, who laughed it off as a wild night; going to a clinic for emergency contraception and asking the doctor if what happened to her counted as rape, and feeling stunned when the doctor said she wasnt qualified to answer the question.The essay sparked a flood of supportive messages on social media from readers who thanked Ms. Knoll for coming forward.It wasnt until she was in her early 20s and in counseling that her therapist helped define what had happened. I was so young that it was very hard to make sense of it, she said, adding: I didnt want to talk about it. I didnt want to deal with it.Ms. Knoll, 32, grew up in a Roman Catholic family in the Philadelphia suburbs, and attended the Shipley School, a prestigious prep institution. She read Sylvia Plath and Flannery OConnor and dreamed of becoming a writer.Before she was assaulted, Ms. Knoll was a happy, social 15-year-old who played sports and was on the dance team. Afterward, she said, she shut down and felt crushingly isolated, unable to connect even with friends. Some classmates taunted her and scrawled trash slut inside her locker.No one was treating me like a victim; they were treating me like I was a perpetrator, like I was getting what I deserved, she said.She added: The message I internalized was that nothing bad happened; you did something wrong.Ms. Knoll said that she took no action against her attackers, who never suffered any consequences. She does not name them in the essay. Shaming them is not the point, she said.Its not directed at them, she said. Its more like, Im going to tell the story this time. This is a very empowering thing for me to be able to say, actually, this is what happened to me, and to take ownership of my own narrative.In college, as an English major at Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y., she tried to reinvent herself. Still, she could never bring herself to let loose at parties the way her friends and classmates did. She was too scared.After graduating, she moved to New York City and took an internship at Parenting magazine, then worked as an editorial assistant at Popular Science. From there, she moved to Cosmopolitan, where she rose through the ranks to become a senior editor.While at Cosmo, Ms. Knoll began writing Luckiest Girl Alive. She decided to use fiction to address her high school trauma.I knew I wanted to write about that in some way, because it was such a visceral experience that stayed with me my whole life, she said.Luckiest Girl Alive is narrated by TifAni FaNelli, an ambitious 28-year-old editor at a womens magazine who writes sex columns and is obsessed with projecting a perfect image. Her life is derailed when she participates in a documentary about her high school, and is forced to confront the rage she has carried with her since she was raped as a teenager. The novel toggles between past and present, and takes a shocking, violent turn in the middle when a second crime devastates the school.After Simon & Schuster published Luckiest Girl Alive last May, Ms. Knoll was flooded with messages from women who said they had endured traumas similar to TifAnis. Many said they were comforted by the dedication page of the book, which reads: To all the TifAni FaNellis of the world. I know.Those messages prompted Ms. Knoll to wonder why she had kept silent.With another big book tour on the horizon  she is traveling to 16 cities to promote the paperback this spring  she decided to stop hiding behind her fictional creation. In January, she contacted Jessica Grose, editor of Lenny, the email newsletter and website started by the actress and writer Lena Dunham and Girls showrunner Jenni Konner, and pitched an essay about how she drew on her experience for her novel.In an email, Ms. Dunham said that she was honored to publish the essay. This word is overused but the piece is the definition of brave, she said.There have been hard moments for Ms. Knoll, both in reliving that awful night and in the painful conversations with friends and family that have followed. Her younger brother never knew what happened to her until he read about it in her novel, she said.In her professional life, Ms. Knoll had been discreet about the autobiographical threads of her novel.We were all shocked and moved by what we read, Jonathan Karp, president and publisher of Simon & Schuster, said in response to the essay. Its a little bit like finding out something about a friend that you never knew, and it makes you respect them even more for their strength and their character.There is also relief. A few months ago, Ms. Knoll attended a book event in New Jersey, where a woman asked her if she had interviewed rape victims while researching the novel. For the first time, Ms. Knoll answered honestly.I said, Yeah, that happened to me, Ms. Knoll said. It was kind of like, Why have I waited so long to say that? What was so hard about that?"}
{"text": "The Syrian forces that recaptured the storied city of Palmyra from Islamic State occupiers this past weekend have encountered dozens of mines that the expelled militants laid as booby traps around treasured ancient ruins sites, Syrias state media reported Tuesday.Accounts of the Palmyra victory published by the official Syrian Arab News Agency also reported that Russias military, which has helped the Syrian forces regain momentum against insurgents with a six-month bombing campaign, was sending 100 mine clearance engineers and trainers of bomb-sniffing dogs to help rid Palmyra of the mines planted by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh.The expulsion of the Islamic State from Palmyra, the ancient Bride of the Desert oasis seized by the militant extremist group 10 months ago, is regarded as a turn in the five-year-old war and an enormous propaganda victory for President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and the Russians.The Palmyra news also has left the United States and other Western and Arab opponents of Mr. Assad in the awkward position of welcoming it while still insisting that the Syrian presidents autocracy and suppression of dissent was the underlying cause of the Syria war.France, one of Mr. Assads most outspoken detractors, was the latest to react to the recapture of Palmyra. The advances against Daesh today cannot erase the fact that the regime bears the main responsibility for the conflict and its 270,000 dead over the past five years, a spokesman for Frances foreign ministry, Romain Nadal, told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday.It is unclear how the Palmyra victory by Mr. Assads forces might affect the diplomacy underway to establish peace negotiations. It came after Secretary of State John Kerry met with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, and with President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow last week to discuss Syria and the preservation of a partial cease-fire that has taken hold in some areas. The United Nations special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, is hoping to convene talks on April 9 in Geneva.Photographs and video images of Palmyra taken by the Syrian forces showed some horrific damage to parts of the 2,000-year-old ruins, a Unesco World Heritage site, including decapitated statues and busts with smashed faces. But Syrias top antiquities official, Maamoun Abdulkarim, said Monday that 80 percent of the ruins appeared to remain intact.The Russians, who have been widely criticized by Mr. Assads opponents and international aid groups for intensive bombing in Syria, have sought to portray the recapture of Palmyra as a triumph of civilization over barbarism. On Sunday, the director general of Unesco, Irina Bokova, said she had been offered help to restore Palmyra, in a personal telephone call from Mr. Putin.Ms. Bokova, who has described the Islamic States destruction of Middle East artifacts as an atrocity against humanity, also said she intended to hold a conference of experts on reconstructing Syrias cultural heritage by the end of April.Foreign news organizations have not been given direct access to Palmyra since the Islamic State retreated. But Syrian activists reached on Tuesday reported that large numbers of displaced civilians from areas thought to have been controlled by the militants were traveling to Azaz, a northwest town near the Turkish border that has become a magnet for hundreds of uprooted Syrians. The activists said many had come from the Palmyra area and from Deir al-Zour farther east.We received about 100 families after Daesh allowed them to leave, which is something unusual, said Mohamed al Abdalla, an activist reached in Azaz. Honestly we werent expecting people from Palmyra and Deir al-Zour to arrive here."}

{"text": "ATLANTA   President Obama, confronting a national epidemic of heroin and prescription drug abuse, met here Tuesday with recovering addicts, doctors and law enforcement officials to underscore his determination to tackle a problem some critics say he left until too late in his administration.We are seeing more people killed because of opioid overdose than from traffic accidents  I mean, think about that, Mr. Obama said at a meeting of the National Rx Drug Abuse and Heroin Summit. It has to be something right up at the top of our radar screen.The administration announced an array of new measures to expand drug treatment centers and increase the use of drugs, like naloxone, that reverse the effects of overdoses from opioids, ranging from illegal narcotics like heroin to brand-name painkillers like OxyContin and Percocet. These modest steps built on the $1.1 billion in additional funding that the White House requested this year to fight opioid addiction.But the president said that this is still an area thats grossly underresourced.Mr. Obama cast the opioid scourge as having transcended economic and social boundaries. If theres a market for heroin in an inner city in Baltimore, the president said, its not going to take that long before those drugs find their way to a wealthy suburb outside Baltimore.The president listened as two fellow panelists recounted their struggles with drug addiction and a treatment process that often stigmatized them as criminals. Crystal Oertle, a 35-year-old mother of two from Ohio, described how she progressed from the recreational use of the painkiller Vicodin to OxyContin and then, finally, to heroin.They are pretty much like heroin, she said of Vicodin and OxyContin. When it came to the point when I couldnt find those pills, I had to go to the street. Thats how I got into using heroin after the pills.Justin Riley, 28, said he had begun experimenting with painkillers in third grade to compensate for a feeling of emotional emptiness. I used to take Benadryl to sleep through the night, he said. Mr. Riley, who has been in recovery since 2007, runs a nationwide organization that helps young people combat addiction.Treating addiction, Mr. Obama said, has been hindered because the public has long viewed opioid use as a character flaw, common to people in poor and minority communities. That has changed, he said, because opioid addiction has spread so widely.Mr. Obama again spoke about these drugs in starkly personal terms. When I was a kid, I was how would I put it?  not always as responsible as I am today, Mr. Obama said to laughs. I was lucky because, for whatever reason, addiction didnt get its claws into me, with the exception of cigarettes.Mr. Obama said he was not certain why he had not strayed into drug use. He referred to friends who had battled drug addiction and were not more morally suspect than me.The last time Mr. Obama traveled outside Washington to dramatize the scourge of opioid addiction  to West Virginia in October  his administration won praise for drawing attention to the problem but was criticized for not doing enough to combat a public health epidemic that worsened greatly during his presidency.Since then, the federal government has published the first national guidelines  for prescription painkillers, required new warning labels for certain kinds of opioid painkillers, and requested an additional $1.1 billion to expand treatment facilities and finance programs to prevent overdoses and crack down on illegal sales of drugs.The only thing I would fault them for is that they waited too long to do this, said Dr. Carl R. Sullivan, the director of addiction services at the West Virginia University School of Medicine. This has been able to idle along for a long time.In particular, Dr. Sullivan said, the national guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provide a compass point for the treatment of patients and the education of medical residents and even practicing doctors. The situation is so dire that we had to do something, he said.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, denied that the administration had waited too long to address the crisis. The Affordable Care Act, he noted, provides funding for expanded treatment of mental health problems, a key cause of drug abuse. By doing so, Mr. Earnest said, the president shifted the focus from purely law enforcement to medical treatment.He said the coming presidential election had thrown a harsh spotlight on the extent of the problem. The Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, after stressing that addiction was a recurring theme in her campaign swings, has proposed $7.5 billion in federal funding to help states expand treatment programs. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has spoken emotionally of the death of his older half sister, Miriam, from a drug overdose at 49.Opioids played a part in 28,648 deaths in the United States in 2014, a record number, according to the C.D.C., and opioid painkillers like OxyContin, Percocet and Vicodin generate nearly $2 billion a year in sales.Part of the problem for the Obama administration in combating these drugs is that the epidemic was fueled in part by doctors who prescribed the medicines indiscriminately, but regulating doctors has historically fallen to the states. Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine are among states that have moved in recent months to limit the ability of doctors to prescribe these pills. But patient and doctor groups, some funded by the pharmaceutical industry, have resisted state and federal efforts.To underscore the role of the states, Mr. Obama invited two lawmakers to join him on the trip: Senator Edward Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of Georgia. Mr. Markey is pushing legislation that would remove all federal caps on the ability of doctors to prescribe buprenorphine, an opioid derivative that is used to treat people addicted to opioids.Coming from a state that is disproportionately impacted by this scourge, Mr. Markey said in a statement, I believe we should do as much as we can, as soon as we can, to expand treatment to those who need it most."}
{"text": "At night, the sun blazes over Tuts Hub Royal Cuisine, a three-story restaurant on Steinway Street in Astoria, Queens, a few blocks south of the strip known as Little Egypt.Once this was a Wendys. Now the solar disc of the god Aten crowns the building, its rays reaching down with human hands. Heads of Hathor, a cow-eared goddess, watch over the sidewalk from atop stocky columns. In lieu of a hostess looms a shining statue of the warrior goddess Sekhmet, whose many names include Giver of Ecstasies, Lady of the Silent Roar Within and One Before Whom Evil Trembles.But there are no hookahs, no belly dancers, said Khaled Abdelhaleem, who opened the restaurant in October. The hieroglyphs, the ibises, the replica of King Tutankhamens throne standing on leonine paws, with winged snakes for arms: All this is not so much exoticism as nostalgia and tribute.Does it feel like an amusement park? Well, yes, and thats a compliment. Ive always dreamed of dining in the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; this may be the closest Ill get. (The dcor is the work of Mohammed Amin, an artist and sculptor.)Note that the surroundings are loftier than the food and the prices. Few dishes rise above $10. Orders are placed at a cash register on the ground floor and delivered to your table on either level, by brisk waitresses who pause just long enough to make sure youre getting fed.And the best dishes have roots in the streets, like hawawshi, dough sealed around bristling ground beef and onions, then baked in a wood-fired oven. Mine arrived in a round with thick, chewy raised edges and spots of char; the insides smoked when tugged apart.For feteer, a glorious crepe with ambitions to pie, dough is flung and spun until strudel-thin and nearly sheer. This is glossed with samna, clarified butter, and folded in layers, like puff pastry or paratha, around the fillings of your choice. Or theirs: I placed my fate in the cooks hands and was rewarded with a flaring mixture of ground beef, sausage unnerved by paprika and pastrami house-made in the Egyptian style, closer to basterma and more outspoken. Feteer is dessert, too, loveliest as a simple snowscape of powdered sugar, with custard lurking within.Mr. Abdelhaleem was born in Sohag, on the western bank of the Nile, and grew up in Alexandria, as did the chef, Mohammed Kamer, known as Mimo. But mysteriously, much of the menu is devoted to American comforts, inviting you to create your own salad, pizza or pasta. (I didnt.)Not surprisingly, falafel and shawarma are on hand, along with sprawling platters of grilled lamb chops, nutmeg-laced chicken kebabs and beef-and-lamb koftas that betray a whiff of cinnamon.Other unlabeled dishes seethe quietly at the steam table behind the counter. This is where I found mombar, rice half-cooked with parsley and cumin and stuffed inside cow-intestine casings, making sausages that were oddly airy and dry.Kushari suggests a collapsed architecture of rice, lentils, chickpeas and macaroni heaped under crisp broken strands of vermicelli and onions shrunk down to their sugars. The stain of red is tomato sauce, humming with cumin and chiles. Two more sauces are offered on the side: shatta, with detonating chiles, and daqqah, a sour crush of garlic, lemon and vinegar. The more of each mixed in, the better.The food is halal and no alcohol is served, in keeping with Mr. Abdelhaleems vision of the restaurant as a haven for Egyptian families, who tend to commandeer the long tables on the second floor.On a recent evening, mothers in headscarves scolded sons across the aisle. Teenage boys huddled in corners, faces lit by cellphones, oblivious to the goddesses standing sentinel. Younger children ate chicken fingers, then escaped to the third floor, a former storage space turned playroom, rigged with video games and karaoke.So history stretches. Cleopatra, the last of the pharaohs, is closer to us in time than to her predecessors who built the pyramids at Giza.And this month, news broke that hidden chambers have been detected in Tutankhamens tomb. The world is still giving up its secrets."}
{"text": "WASHINGTON  Home prices in the United States climbed again at the start of the year, adding to pressure on buyers in a sellers market. Americans are feeling more confident this month, another report released on Tuesday showed, as a rebounding stock market brightened their outlook.In January, the Standard & Poors/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index rose 5.7 percent from a year earlier, a slight increase from the 5.6 percent annual increase in December.The pace of U.S. home value growth has been picking up bit by bit over the past few months, driven in large part by stubbornly low inventory in most markets that creates competition and drives up prices for those homes that are available, said Svenja Gudell, chief economist at the real estate firm Zillow.Home values have risen at a faster pace than average hourly wages, which have improved just 2.2 percent, according to a government report this month. Tight supplies of homes for sale have propelled much of the price growth, as low mortgage rates and steady hiring have increased demand.Denver, Portland, San Francisco and Seattle each registered double-digit annual price increases. Home values rose in all 20 metro area markets, which account for roughly half of the housing stock in the country.The index remains more than 11 percent below its mid-2006 peak, when subprime mortgages pushed the market to heights that set off the recession in late 2007.Existing homes sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.08 million in February, the National Association of Realtors said this month. Sales dipped 7.1 percent from a relatively healthy pace in January, but an increase in the number of signed contracts to buy houses indicates that purchases should rebound in March.Despite the demand, listings in February declined 1.1 percent from a year ago. Many homeowners are reluctant to sell, because they lack the equity to cover the down payment for a new house.The low inventory of homes for sale  currently about a five-month supply  means that would-be sellers seeking to trade up are having a hard time finding a new, larger home, said David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices.In a separate report, the Conference Board said that its consumer confidence index rose to 96.2 this month, after tumbling to a revised 94 in February.Consumers assessment of current economic conditions has dipped. But their outlook for the future has improved modestly.United States markets got off to a dismal start in 2016, driven by fears of economic weakness overseas and plunging oil prices, but they have since recovered most of those losses. This month, 28.7 percent of consumers said they expected stocks to rise over the next year. That was up from 26.9 percent in February, the lowest share since July 2012.A year ago, the overall consumer confidence index stood at 101.4. But Americans have grown cautious, and consumer spending grew at a meager 0.1 percent annual rate in February, the government said on Monday, matching Januarys unimpressive gain.Given the very disappointing real consumer spending results for January and February, this pickup in confidence is good news, said Jennifer Lee, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets."}
{"text": "Deep breaths, everyone.Yes, Instagram will be changing how it presents which photos and videos you see, going from a strictly heres-the-latest model to an algorithm much like the news feed on Facebook.No, the change is not happening right now, as many users mistakenly believe.And the many requests you have probably received to turn on notifications for individual users may not be your best bet to continue seeing the posts you most want to see.Starting last weekend, many peoples feeds were cluttered with images pointing up and to the right, with celebrities, major brands and everyday users imploring followers to turn on notifications for their individual accounts.While changes are, indeed, coming, many of the posts suggested they would be happening immediately. For most people, that is untrue.Despite the rumors, no feed changes are being implemented right now  we still have weeks, or even months, of testing to go, an Instagram spokesman said in a statement. Currently the test groups are very small. When we roll it out broadly, we will definitely let the community know.By turning on notifications for an individual account, you would allow Instagram to send you the equivalent of a text message every time that account has a new post.That might be O.K. for your favorite accounts, but it is likely to become tiresome if used too often. Your favorite friends, brands and celebrities may essentially be asking to overwhelm you with notifications.The panic is based on a fear that once the algorithm takes over, posts you would otherwise see in a reverse chronological presentation may soon be hidden. That is true: Instagram is likely to present photos and videos based on how inclined you are to be interested in them, your history of interaction with the user and how timely the posts are. If you rarely like or comment on an accounts photo, those photos might be less likely to show up.But you may see more of an account if you interact often with it. If you like every one of your friends photos of her cat, you would more likely see her photos, even if they were posted many hours before you logged in. Instagram is betting that you probably wont scroll down too far and that you would rather see your friends cat than whatever was posted five minutes ago.On average, people miss about 70 percent of the posts in their Instagram feed, Kevin Systrom, co-founder and chief executive of Instagram, said in an interview in March. What this is about is making sure that the 30 percent you see is the best 30 percent possible.A similar concern has risen each time a major social network has switched to an algorithmic approach. Facebook faced criticism in 2009, and Twitter heard a similar uproar last month when it began putting older tweets at the top of user timelines.Nonprofit groups, news organizations and brands have long expressed frustration with their diminishing reach on Facebook. Many users, including celebrities, appear to be bracing for a similar result on Instagram."}
{"text": "By Sara Majka160 pages. Graywolf Press. $16.The stories in Sara Majkas arresting collection, her first book, mostly feature (seemingly) the same narrator, a searching, lovelorn woman in the Northeast. Life hadnt been quite what I wanted, she says in one story. I didnt have the things I would say I wanted most. One story starts: During the trip, the lover I had left behind in New York had stopped calling. Another: Maybe 10 or 11 years ago, when I was in the middle of a divorce from a man I still loved, I took the train into the city. The stories are peppered with broad, effective declarations of emotional philosophy: We fall out of love only to fall in love with a duplicate of what weve left, never understanding that we love what we love and that it doesnt change. They are also anchored in keenly observed specific details and pivot around deceptively imaginative plots. These are modest-seeming stories that hold deep truths, by a writer of great promise.Essays Near KnowingBy Brian Blanchfield183 pages. Nightboat Books. $15.95.Brian Blanchfields brief, multivalent essays are titled to echo the master of the form, Montaigne. They include On Withdrawal, On Tumbleweed and On House Sitting. In the beginning, some sentences might send you scurrying. To wit: Ordained confinement wherein embrace is organized as a situational necessity is recognizably the ground floor of my erotic imagination. But stick with it. Mr. Blanchfields more high-flown reflections not only become more palatable over time, theyre also slyly used in juxtaposition with the plain-spoken memories of this working class white boy from North Carolina, who grew up with an abusive stepfather and a mother who, when he was 17, told him, Youd better not be gay. (He was, and is.) He calls the essays inroads to disinhibited autobiography. One becomes acclimated to, and impressed by, the way he transitions from, say, an etymological investigation of billiards terminology to the way his father shot pool.By Lynn Steger Strong266 pages. Liveright. $26.95.This debut novel revolves around the relationship between Maya and Stephen, professors at Columbia University living the bourgeois life in Park Slope, and their troubled daughter, Ellie, who has dropped out of college, hangs around with a troubled crowd and has a penchant for escaping into drugs. Ellie wants to convince her parents that there are whole gradations of just trying to have a little fun that dont end in tragedy and homelessness, but we learn early on that Ellies story does end in tragedy, after she is sent to Florida to stay with Annie, a longtime friend of her mothers. We even know, more or less, how. Ms. Strong has a highly sensitive awareness of the special kind of disappointment  and the painfully undying connection  that comes with family. Theres mercifully little armchair psychology about Ellie and no blatantly obvious reason that she should be so damaged or careless. She just is, and in that way feels authentic.By Danielle Dutton167 pages. Catapult. $15.95.This slender but dense imagining of the life of Margaret Cavendish, a pioneering 17th-century writer and wife of the aristocrat William Cavendish, could be classified as a more elliptical cousin of Hilary Mantels Thomas Cromwell novels. Its brief chapters cover years in mere paragraphs, and paint a collagelike portrait of an eccentric woman known during her time as Mad Madge. Margaret flees England during its civil war, and meets and marries her husband in Paris. Unable to become pregnant, she spends years feeling invisible until she turns to writing. She composes poems, plays and philosophy. While one book in the world might be considered an anomaly, she thinks, two books, it seemed, sounded an alarm. Ms. Duttons style is tightly poetic. It was indescribable what she wanted, she writes of Margaret. She wanted to be 30 people.  To live as nature does, in many ages, in many brains.By Pat Barker307 pages. Doubleday. $27.95.Pat Barker wraps up another trilogy of novels with her first book about World War II. (Her Regeneration books were set against World War I, as were the first two books of this series, Life Class and Tobys Room.) The painters Elinor Brooke and Paul Tarrant are now married and helping with the war effort in London during the Blitz, Elinor as an ambulance driver and Paul as an air-raid warden. Art students in the earlier books, they here contend not only with the continual danger from above but also with the strains of middle-age love. As usual, Ms. Barker deftly handles a large cast, including a medium who claims to speak with the dead and a young boy taken in by Elinors family after he was orphaned by the war. Ms. Barker set the bar so high with her profoundly imagined Regeneration trilogy that the more recent novels can feel a bit slick by comparison. That still leaves them room to be historical fiction of a high order.By Helen Oyeyemi325 pages. Riverhead Books. $27.The first story collection by the prolific British writer Helen Oyeyemi  she is 31, and this is her sixth book  continues in the vein of her novels, playing with conventions familiar from fairy tales and fantasy. Ms. Oyeyemi writes about ghosts and tyrants in faraway lands with a straight-faced confidence. And she imbues her more realistic stories with an off-kilter tone that makes them feel slightly, sometimes indescribably magical. This book is united, in a way that sometimes feels strained, by literal and metaphorical keys, which appear in some form or other in every story. Ms. Oyeyemis vivid imagination and her dry humor are encapsulated in a detail from Drownings, in which the same key opens every door in a building, but the landlord counted on it not occurring to any of the tenants to try opening doors other than their own. And indeed, mostly the tenants dutifully enter only their assigned doors, too busy and too tired to go anywhere but home."}

The show has an unusual history: it was created through the combination of two one-act musicals, March of the Falsettos and Falsettoland, which both premiered Off Broadway at Playwrights Horizons.Lincoln Center Theater is producing the revival in association with Jujamcyn Theaters. It is a passion project for Jordan Roth, the president of Jujamcyn, who said that he believed the musical was way ahead of its time and that now will resonate even more profoundly. The artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, Andr Bishop, also has a strong connection to the show: He was the artistic director at Playwrights Horizons when each of its component parts was presented.The revival is scheduled to begin previews on Sept. 29 and open on Oct. 27 at the Walter Kerr Theater. It is to be directed by Mr. Lapine, who also directed the original."}
{"text": "Two Tennessee-based cancer charities that were labeled shams by the Federal Trade Commission have settled a large fraud case, along with their president, by agreeing to a $75.8 million judgment and the dissolution of the businesses. The joint action by the trade commission and all 50 states says the president, James T. Reynolds Sr., and others spent donations meant for cancer patients on six-figure salaries and luxury vacations. Much of what was sent to patients was virtually worthless, including sample-size soaps, Little Debbie snack cakes and blank greeting cards, according to court documents. The settlement with Mr. Reynolds, Cancer Fund of America and Cancer Support Services was filed on Wednesday in federal court in Arizona. It requires the judges signature before it takes effect. Mr. Reynoldss son and ex-wife previously agreed to settlements involving two related charities. The former president of Cancer Support Services also settled earlier. Together, the four charities raised more than $187 million between 2008 and 2012."}
{"text": "In Diane von Furstenbergs spring fashion campaign video, Karlie Kloss wears a wrap dress in a clashing combination of miniature pink and green blossoms as she poses against an equally pattern-mad backdrop of hearts and flowers and cheetah spots. Its a giddy mix for sure, but Ms. Kloss, the model-slash-entrepreneur-slash-New York University student, pulls it off with aplomb.This is me being me, she says, fixing the camera with a challenging stare. Now you be you.Not such a tall order, it seems, if you consider the wealth of fashion options this season, many aimed at women with magpie tendencies and an eye for pleasing dissonance, the kind expressed on spring runways in the form of crazily inventive, willfully chaotic juxtapositions of color, texture, pattern and shape.There were every-which-way stripes and plaids at Marc Jacobs, artfully mismatched chiffons and brocades at Dries Van Noten, and a Gypsy mashup of swirling motifs at Gucci, where the designer Alessandro Michele set much of the tone for the season.Springs joyful irreverence is as evident at Christopher Kane, whose multitoned skirt, a cataract of fringe, is combined on these pages with a caution-yellow Rosie Assoulin off-the-shoulder top; or at Rag & Bone, whose skinny latticework dress is improbably teamed here with a patchwork lace Derek Lam skirt trailing a wispy handkerchief hem.A closer look at these and other unlikely pairings would seem to argue that the disruptive climate governing everything from politics to technology has infiltrated the world of style  and in particular, the wardrobes of those fashion indies, young or not so young, bent on upending the style worlds most hallowed conventions.The playfulness and eccentricity weve been seeing on the runways seems to be a response to a shift toward individual dressing, said Rachael Wang, the fashion director of Allure. It underscores the point, Ms. Wang said, that there are no longer hard and fast rules for whats in or out. Instead, she said, One can find justification for wearing almost anything.Its a position staked out by fashions premier rule-breakers, designers like Mr. Michele, Miuccia Prada and Demna Gvasalia of Vetements and Balenciaga, each an ardent champion of an uncorked self-expression that can be charmingly eccentric, if not downright subversive.Their madcap experiments with color, texture and form are a testament to the high spirits pervading fashion now. Like a John Cage symphony or a Joseph Cornell collage, the fashion scribe and Vogue contributor Lynn Yaeger writes in the recent Bergdorf Goodman style supplement, these unlikely mlanges can really make the heart sing.There is nothing dour about a Stella McCartney dress, all swingy accordion pleats, shown here with an embroidered silk bomber by Opening Ceremony. Such colorful combinations offer a bracing antidote to the numbing predictability of normcore or the self-conscious rigors of minimalism.Michelle Elie, a former model and the designer of Prim, a collection of jewelry and accessories, said she welcomes a more playful, apparently anarchic approach. With what goes on in the world around us, and so little that we can control, such collections capture a moment of lightness, she said.There are plenty of precedents, certainly, some dating from the advent of hippies, who didnt balk at combining multitiered prairie skirts with Army surplus field jackets, or circus-striped trousers with filmy Edwardian dressing gowns.I have been styling in this sense for years, said Natalie Joos, a stylist, writer and photographer in New York. For a recent post on Tales of Endearment, her popular vintage-fashion blog, Ms. Joos dressed the model Xiao Wen Ju in a Cuisinart mix, sliding a varsity jacket over a floor-length sequined gown. In another instance, she dressed her in a screwball assortment of up-and-down and sideways stripes.I welcome this kind of whimsical fashion, she said.As for the latest purveyors of whimsy, J. W. Anderson, Simon Porte Jacquemus and the like: Theyre doing something new and unique and intelligent, Ms. Joos said emphatically. By all means let them."}
{"text": "With the Zika virus spreading largely unchecked in Latin America and the Caribbean by way of a now-notorious insect, some of the nations leading mosquito researchers are striving to assemble a state-of-the-art DNA map that they say will help them fight the disease with the mosquitos own genetic code.The quest involves scientists from assorted disciplines who rarely collaborate, often compete for funding and have different ideas about how to genetically manipulate the mosquito, Aedes aegypti.Some want to hunt for genes that, if altered in mosquitoes released into the wild, could drive the species to extinction. Others are trying to identify genes that control how mosquitoes sense human prey so as to devise better repellents. Still others favor the idea of selectively breeding populations of mosquitoes, like corn or cattle, for desirable  or, at least, less undesirable  traits, such as a preference for biting animals other than humans.The project took off after a series of frustrated Twitter posts from Leslie B. Vosshall, a mosquito researcher at Rockefeller University. Dr. Vosshall issued a plea for advice on constructing a detailed mosquito DNA map in January, as Brazil began reporting a spike, apparently related to the Zika virus, in newborns with unusually small heads.I was worried people would be defensive or paranoid or weird, she said in the days leading up to the scientists first nine-way videoconference call. For a long time, I think we all thought the map was somebody elses job.The bid to map the genome of the Aedes mosquito has received little attention, perhaps because a map in itself will not yield a fix for Zika, any more than the human genome map has yielded a cure for cancer. It might lead to biological possibilities, moreover, whose ecological consequences are deemed too serious to risk.But the story of how the Aedes Genome Working Group emerged offers a glimpse at the often ad hoc way science lurches forward, driven by self-interest, new technology and pressing social needs. The pursuits of its members reflect the range of hopes for a new form of genetic combat that may be increasingly called into play as the specter of diseases borne by insects grows along with our ability to parse the details of their DNA.And the need to control the Aedes mosquito, which also carries yellow fever and other viruses, is not likely to end with this outbreak. Despite the introduction of a vaccine against yellow fever that saved millions of lives, for instance, the virus still kills 30,000 people a year.If were going to control the creature, we need to know it frontwards and backwards, said Jeffrey Powell, a mosquito researcher at Yale University, who was among the first to join forces with Dr. Vosshall. Having a complete genome sequence of the beast will give us a fundamental understanding of its biology that you cant get any other way.Genome mapping, which first captured the public imagination in 2000 with the release of a draft of the human DNA sequence, has become a fundamental tool of modern molecular biology, used to help study how living things evolve, develop, get sick and behave. An Aedes genome map of sorts, too, has existed since 2007, but researchers say it is staggeringly imperfect: fragmented into 36,204 pieces, some of which are themselves misassembled, with hundreds of genes known to be missing and others mistakenly duplicated.For a long time, cost and sheer difficulty made filling in every detail prohibitive for all but a few genome sequences, including our own and those of a handful of laboratory favorites like mice and fruit flies. Even as new techniques have made it easier and more affordable to create better maps, the task has been seen more as a technical feat than a scientific one, which is one reason the Aedes map has remained in its state of disrepair.Theres not a lot of glory in it, Dr. Powell conceded.Zika, however, has helped galvanize the small community of researchers who already spend most of their time thinking about the insect. The normally mild viruss apparent link to brain damage in babies whose mothers were infected while pregnant has stirred fears worldwide and led health officials to declare the current pandemic a public health emergency.An Aedes mosquito in the United States could become a carrier for the virus if the insect bit a traveler who had acquired Zika abroad. Though the use of air-conditioning and screens is likely to limit outbreaks in the United States as the mosquito population swells in the South this summer, stanching Zikas spread means controlling a mosquito that has grown resistant to previously effective insecticides and requires only minute amounts of standing water to breed.A few experiments with the mass release of biologically altered mosquitoes, carried out by a biotechnology company and by researchers funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, have reportedly had some success. But researchers say other strategies are virtually certain to be needed. With the Obama administration asking for $1.8 billion to combat Zika, it seemed likely to Dr. Vosshall that the budget for a new map  a few hundred thousand dollars, with enough support and volunteer labor from other researchers  could somehow be secured.And on their first videoconference call in late January, nine far-flung teams of scientists found common cause in their discontent with trying to track down which genes control which traits on a map that often leads them astray.I cant tell you how many meetings Ive been to where people use four-letter words to describe the existing map, Anthony A. James, a mosquito researcher at the University of California, Irvine, observed to the group.Amid different opinions about the best approach and who would pay for what, a consensus emerged. The DNA for the new map would be extracted from the offspring of a very particular mating of Aedes mosquitoes, from the same line mapped a decade earlier.A few days later, researchers at Virginia Tech shipped the offspring in the form of dried eggs to Dr. Vosshalls laboratory at Rockefeller, where they were hatched and reared by a postdoctoral fellow, Ben Matthews. Since females will not lay eggs until they are fed, Dr. Matthews took a necessary first step. Inside a humid chamber, behind an airlock and a third heavy door, he offered up his arm for a bite so that the selected Eve could take what is known in the parlance of mosquito researchers as a blood meal.Its kind of amazing, he said cheerfully, when you think about the amount of money, time and science thats going to come downstream of this.That a genome map for Aedes aegypti, however imperfect, was published in 2007 is a testament to the species longtime status as a potent human foe. (Its genus name, bestowed by 18th-century naturalists with a penchant for accuracy, means unpleasant in ancient Greek; aegypti refers to Egypt, where it was first believed to have been collected.)Besides Zika and yellow fever, the insect carries dengue, which causes a severe and sometimes fatal flulike illness, and chikungunya, which can cause intense joint pain that lasts for years.Because Aedes is easier to maintain in laboratories, it is simpler to study than its more lethal cousins, certain Anopheles mosquitoes, which kill some 800,000 people a year by infecting them with malaria. The hope that scientists could blunt the threat of both species by learning which genes control what in Aedes was what persuaded the National Institutes of Health to underwrite the initial sequencing of the mosquitos genome for about $18 million.The genomes of every living thing consist of four chemical units that function like letters in an alphabet, arranged in sequences, or words, that tell its cells what to do. In Aedess case, each cell nucleus contains 1.3 billion letters of DNA from each parent, coiled into three chromosomes. Since the order of the words is also important, in an ideal world, a DNA sequence would consist of those same letters, which would then be assembled, or mapped, into three long stretches.But the technology used for the 2007 Aedes map, and many others, could only read relatively short stretches of DNA at a time, which were then pieced together by matching up the sections where they overlapped in a process that often left some areas garbled and riddled with gaps. And since more than half of the Aedes genome consists of sequences that repeat again and again, it has proved more difficult than many genomes to make sense of.Have you seen The Shining? Dr. Vosshall asked, referring to the classic horror film in which the psychotic Jack Torrance character, played by Jack Nicholson, appears to be writing a novel that turns out to be the same phrase over and over again. Its like you have a thousand copies of all work and no play and then three sentences of unique text.Adam M. Phillippy, an expert in assembling genome maps at the National Institutes of Health, likened the process to doing a puzzle for which the pieces have precisely the same shape, are tiny, and youre missing the cover.But over the last few years, technology has emerged that allows the DNA letters to be read in stretches of tens of thousands at a time, making for bigger puzzle pieces and prompting biologists to revisit older genome maps.Remapping the supposedly complete human genome with the new technique has yielded several previously unknown genes active in the brain that scientists say may hold clues to how we differ from other apes. The United States Agriculture Department is in the process of remapping pig, goat and cattle genomes in the expectation of finding genes that make for healthier and more efficient farm animals.Evan E. Eichler, a human geneticist at the University of Washington who recently led a team in assembling a new gorilla genome, called the new information that scientists had been able to glean mind-blowing.Theres a strong case to be made for going back to the mosquito and redoing it, he said, like there is for any genome that still has lots of gaps.Aware of the new technology, Dr. Vosshall floated the idea of a new Aedes map on Twitter: The Aedes aegypti mosquito is infecting millions with #Zika and #Dengue, she wrote on Jan. 28, but we still havent put all the pieces of its genome together.Ultimately, she received over a dozen replies from the cast who would make up the group, including a virologist, a population geneticist, several molecular biologists and experts in assorted aspects of the art of genome assembly.One came from Mark Kunitomi, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San Francisco. Hi Leslie, his email started. I follow you on Twitter.Dr. Kunitomi and his adviser, the virologist Raul Andino, believe that the key to what makes some populations of Aedes mosquitoes resistant to viruses like Zika lies in bits of viral code embedded in their DNA. Such information might allow researchers to predict where in the world outbreaks are most likely to arise and, in effect, to vaccinate a mosquito population by releasing mosquitoes with the requisite viral DNA inserted.To pursue the idea, Dr. Andino and Dr. Kunitomi produced a new version of an Aedes map in collaboration with Pacific Biosciences, the company that has pioneered the new sequencing technology. This version yielded many hundreds of genes not found in the 2007 map. But, while better, it is still short of what scientists are looking for because it comes from an Aedes cell line with many mutations.Dr. Kunitomi mentioned that Dr. Vosshall might want to reach out to Dr. Powell, the mosquito researcher at Yale, who Dr. Kunitomi had learned was working with the same company. Dr. Powell, too, was in search of the genes that control the mosquitos ability to transmit viruses. But a truly complete map would require paying for more sequencing with the Pacific Biosciences technology, and several other steps that he could not afford.Dr. James of the University of California, Irvine, also voiced support. His interest in the map came from his work on a technology called gene drive, in which a trait engineered into a few individuals in a species  sterility, say, or an altered immune system  is made to spread rapidly through a population as a result of a trick that ensures it is transmitted to all descendants, bypassing the normally random process of inheritance.While that technology might be used to stop the Zika virus, gene drive is controversial because of fears that an altered gene might escape into another species. Dr. James argued that such concerns could be mitigated if the gene were unique to Aedes, or at least to mosquitoes. (They do something fruit flies dont do, he noted. They feed on blood.) But to have any hope of that, he needed a map to compare Aedes genes against others.For me, its an extension of the engineering principle that you want to be as targeted as you can, he said.Researchers at Colorado State and at the University of Bristol in England also weighed in. At the University of Notre Dame, David W. Severson, who had orchestrated the making of the original map, offered to help. On Twitter, Dr. Phillippy, of the National Institutes of Health, responded with advice on the best approach to creating a new mosquito map and volunteered his services.The N.I.H. came through with a $15,000 emergency grant, and Eric S. Lander, the director of the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard, called Dr. Vosshall with an offer to devote the institutions considerable resources to the project. It was like getting a call from the pope, Dr. Vosshall recalled.Though it is still short by some $250,000 required for the finishing touches, by late last month, the group had a plan that involved three types of DNA sequencing and enough funding to start. And so Dr. Matthews extracted the DNA from the pupae that the Eve had produced. It is now being sequenced."}

Making sense of them as a whole, however, might not be desirable or even possible.Oh, and all the quiz items do appear in the movie, but the craziness question is your call entirely."}
{"text": "PARIS   A suspected Islamic State operative who was arrested last week had amassed a trove of guns and bomb-making equipment, including the type of explosive used in terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, the French authorities announced on Wednesday, reinforcing fears that militants are planning additional assaults on Europe.The suspect, Reda Kriket, a 34-year-old Frenchman, was arrested on Thursday afternoon in Boulogne-Billancourt, a western suburb of Paris. That evening, the authorities raided a fourth-floor apartment Mr. Kriket had rented under a fake name in Argenteuil, a northwestern suburb that was once a popular weekend getaway and a subject for Impressionist painters.Inside the apartment, the authorities found an arsenal of weapons and explosives of an unprecedented size, which led them to believe Mr. Kriket had been planning an imminent attack, the Paris prosecutor, Franois Molins, said at a news conference on Wednesday evening, describing for the first time the scope of the plot.The arsenal included explosive materials  among them TATP, which was used in suicide bombs that were set off in Paris on Nov. 13 and in Brussels on March 22  along with Kalashnikov assault rifles, a submachine gun, pistols, ammunition, four boxes containing thousands of small steel balls, stolen French passports, brand-new cellphones, a tear-gas canister and two computers with instructions to make explosives.A judge who focuses on terrorism cases charged Mr. Kriket on Wednesday with terrorist conspiracy, possession of weapons and explosives, and falsification of documents, among other offenses, Mr. Molins said.Mr. Kriket had an extensive criminal record, with multiple convictions for robbery, possession of stolen goods and acts of violence, Mr. Molins added.More recently, according to court records, Mr. Kriket raised money for a network of militants in 2012 and 2013. He and an accomplice, Anis Bahri, 32, are believed to have visited Syria between late 2014 and early 2015, Mr. Molins said. After returning to Europe, he said, they traveled back and forth among France, Belgium and the Netherlands.On July 29, a Belgian court convicted Mr. Kriket in absentia of financing a jihadist recruitment network with proceeds from robberies and other crimes. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, believed to have been the chief on-the-ground planner of the Paris attacks, was named in the same proceeding.Mr. Molins said that investigators had not uncovered a specific target or date for the planned attack and were trying to identify other accomplices. Under questioning, he said, Mr. Kriket denied being a terrorist, said he had rented the Argenteuil apartment on behalf of someone whom he would not name, and said the unidentified man and an accomplice were the bomb makers.Three men have been held in other countries on suspicion of working with Mr. Kriket. One is Mr. Bahri, whom the Dutch police arrested in the port city of Rotterdam on Sunday at the request of the French authorities. The other two are Algerians who were arrested in Brussels on Friday: Abderahmane Ameroud, 38, and a man identified only as Rabah M., 34. (He was previously identified as Rabah N. and Salah A.)Mr. Ameroud had been convicted of providing logistical support to two Tunisian suicide bombers who assassinated Ahmed Shah Massoud, an Afghan opposition leader, two days before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. In 2005, Mr. Ameroud was found guilty of complicity in the murder.Mr. Ameroud was also linked to an Afghan and Pakistani network suspected of training would-be jihadists in a forest near Paris and in the French Alps. He was convicted of participation in a terrorist enterprise in 2007 and was thought to have been deported to Algeria after serving his sentence.On Wednesday, a court in Brussels delayed proceedings against him and Rabah M. to April 7, at the request of their lawyers.Also on Wednesday, a government official said that a file with the floor plan and photographs of the office of the Belgian prime minister had been found on a laptop computer discarded in a garbage can last week by one of the terrorists linked to the Brussels attacks. It was found during a raid in the Schaerbeek neighborhood hours after the attacks.Several Belgian newspapers, including LEcho, De Tijd and De Morgen, reported that the information about the prime ministers office, the site of regular meetings of cabinet ministers, had been found on the laptop.On the same computer, investigators found a statement, described by the authorities as a will, by Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, one of three suicide bombers in the attacks. In that statement, Mr. Bakraoui described himself as increasingly desperate and fearful of ending up in prison.He and another man, Najim Laachraoui, blew themselves up at Brussels Airport, and Mr. Bakraouis younger brother, Khalid, detonated a suicide bomb at the Maelbeek subway station. The attacks killed 32 people, a lower toll than previously reported, having been revised downward on Tuesday as the authorities finished identifying victims.Officials are seeking a third airport attacker and, according to Belgian reports, another person involved in the subway blast.Local news reports said the discarded computer also contained precise information about the prime ministers residence on the Rue de la Loi, steps from the United States Embassy. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Prime Minister Charles Michel at the residence on Friday.European nations have come under increasing scrutiny for their response to terrorism. On Wednesday, President Obamas top counterterrorism adviser, Lisa O. Monaco, criticized allies, including France and Belgium, for failing to reduce barriers to the sharing of intelligence among agencies, as the United States did after the Sept. 11 attacks.Ms. Monacos remarks, at a security conference at the University of Texas at Austin, were one of the Obama administrations sternest rebukes of its European partners since the Paris and Brussels attacks.Its fair to say that they have not had the same reaction that we did after we had 9/11, which was to share information amongst ourselves and to get into a position to share it very rapidly with our international partners, Ms. Monaco said.Hours before Ms. Monaco spoke, Ard van der Steur, the Dutch minister for security and justice, said it had been the intelligence division of the New York Police Department, not the F.B.I., that warned the Netherlands on March 16 that the Bakraoui brothers had links to terrorism.Mr. van der Steur had previously testified before Dutch lawmakers that the warning came from the F.B.I., but in a statement on Wednesday, he said he had misspoken. It was not clear how the police in New York had become aware of the brothers.The Turkish government arrested Ibrahim el-Bakraoui near the Turkish border with Syria in June. Officials there alerted the Belgian government and then deported Mr. Bakraoui to the Netherlands at his request."}
{"text": "Late on the night of April 9, 2013, Jeff Walz, coach of the Louisville womens basketball team, had dinner in a New Orleans restaurant after losing the national championship game. One of his companions was Rick Pitino, in from Atlanta after coaching the mens team to the title the previous night.For Walz, the potentially historic occasion had turned into another Connecticut coronation, as well as the introduction to grand-stage veneration for a dazzling freshman, Breanna Stewart.From across the table, what do you say that is sympathetic but sensible to a coach and university colleague whose team had just been dismantled by 33 points?Here is what Pitino offered.The difference between your game and our game is that our equivalent of Breanna Stewart is not back in our game next season, Pitino said. Shes gone to the N.B.A. to make her millions.Yeah, Walz said mournfully. And in our game, shes back for the next three years, doing what she does and getting a degree.Three years later, with two more titles won and one left to make it a perfect four, is this something about womens basketball to, you know, lament?In a recent Twitter post, the longtime Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy wrote, Watch? No thanks, after a 60-point Connecticut drubbing of Mississippi State. This set off a firestorm that was as predictable as a caustic retort from Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma (Dont watch, he said).Those playing and presiding over womens sports are rightly sensitive to and sick of the double standards.As Serena Williams has dominated the womens tennis field with extraordinary shotmaking, complaints have been heard that many of her opponents are frauds. By contrast, when Roger Federer ruled mens tennis in the pre-Rafael Nadal days, he was supposedly reinventing the sport as modern dance.When U.C.L.A. was winning 10 national championships and mixing in an 88-game winning streak between 1964 and 1975, its coach, John Wooden, was a strategic wizard, an enduring legend. With Auriemma two victories from his 11th title, after surpassing the U.C.L.A. winning streak six years ago, suddenly a defense must be mounted against Shaughnessys assertion about Connecticuts transcendence: Hate to punish them for being great, but they are killing womens game.Granted, it was one Twitter post (though one that reflected a common male refrain). And Connecticut has had its share of opponents in early rounds of the N.C.A.A. tournament that didnt belong on the same floor.No one has ever made the argument that the womens game  decades behind the mens game, developmentally  has more depth. At the very top, mens programs that have Connecticuts history, rabid fan base, and great recruiter and coach are much more common.Things eventually change  next year, they lose three great players and might lose in the Elite Eight, as if that would be horrible, Walz said in a telephone interview. But its harder when a Maya Moore stays four years, a Diana Taurasi, a Breanna Stewart.Just imagine, he said, if Anthony Davis and Karl-Anthony Towns (in different time frames) had stayed at Kentucky for four years, or if Jahlil Okafor and Justise Winslow had parked themselves at Duke for the long haul. How balanced would the mens game actually be?But even that telling difference isnt the principal issue, Auriemma said Wednesday in a teleconference setting up the semifinals Sunday in Indianapolis.Stop focusing on Connecticut, and start paying attention to what a lot of these other schools are doing, he said.He was referring to Oregon State  the Huskies semifinal opponent Sunday night  along with Syracuse and Washington, all first-timers at the Final Four.Those are not teams, he added, that were knocking on the door and finally got there. In other words, Connecticut aside, the top-seeded teams in three of the regionals  often as reliably Final Four-bound as UConn  were sent home by opponents demonstrating a greater depth and a commitment that is gradually taking root.In February, Brian Stewart, Breannas father, spoke of taking his young daughter to hometown Syracuse games in front of 200 spectators. That university  like others in the Big East  had a renowned mens team but seemed not to care that its womens program was a perennial doormat.At Syracuse, the women consistently had unsightly records throughout the 1990s and several years after the turn of the century. But under Quentin Hillsman, now in his 10th season as coach, the Orange have not won fewer than 22 games since 2008-9.The rising began in the old Big East, as it did for others such as Notre Dame, St. Johns and Louisville, where, Walz said, were at the point now where when we lose in the second round, as we did this year, thats unacceptable.That, he agreed, was in large part due to the influence of UConn, which understandably still draws almost all the attention from those with limited interest in the sport.Then come the double standards, the casual dismissals that make Auriemma bristle most  the belief that what UConn is doing is easy and not in defiance of the odds and gods that govern the whims of 20-year-olds.On the subject of commentary and chance, when Auriemma was asked what it might mean that there are four male head coaches in the Final Four for the first time (the previous high was two), he found little to expound on, for once.I think it takes the focus off what the players have done and what the coaches have done and how theyve earned the right to play in the Final Four, he said. Whatever the greater meaning, whatever the social commentary and all that, we can save that for another time and place.This place  Bankers Life Fieldhouse  should be reserved for the likely historic achievement, and for those teams that have earned the right to try to carve a place on the Mount Rushmore of American sporting underdogs.Washington and Oregon State will have a say, but consider the possibility that Stewart will shoot for perfection against the program whose unimposing shadow she grew up in.Auriemma noted that he had tried to schedule a homecoming game this season for the player he calls Stewie, but it didnt seem to fit into Syracuses schedule.The Huskies played in upstate New York at Colgate instead. A showdown for the national title would be an even better narrative, even as a blowout. But unwatchable?Last word to Auriemma.Im not asking you to watch, he said. But dont demean those that do appreciate it. Thats all."}

{"text": "Donald J. Trump on Thursday allowed that he might have misspoken on the topic of abortion when he told the MSNBC host Chris Matthews that women who have abortions should face some form of punishment if the procedure is banned.But he insisted the media attention to a misstep  amid the volume of questions he answers  gets outsize attention.If you answer one question inartfully or incorrectly in some form, or you misunderstood it or you misspoke, it ends up being a big story, he said. That doesnt happen with other people.Mr. Trump made the comments in a brief phone interview about whether he takes at-times needless risks in his campaign.I think all politics is risk, Mr. Trump said.In the exchange with Mr. Matthews on Wednesday, the television host pressed Mr. Trump repeatedly on how he would handle punishments if abortion became illegal. Mr. Trump, who used to support abortion rights but in 2011 switched his position and said he had evolved, repeatedly tried to push past the question, but eventually said that there would have to be a punishment of some kind if abortion became illegal.The outcry from both political parties was swift, and within three hours Mr. Trump issued a statement reversing course.Asked whether the exchange with Mr. Matthews spoke to a lack of familiarity with how conservatives view abortion, he rejected that idea.He said that it was an extensive back-and-forth with Mr. Matthews. I was really talking about his religion, Mr. Trump said, referring to a point in the exchange where he mentioned the Roman Catholic Church.Im asked hundreds of questions a day, he said. You multiply that by months and months and months, and every once in awhile, if you misspeak  I was very focused on the topic of the Catholic Church.Mr. Trump added: The difference is that if I say something thats off, if I say something thats off one way or another, it gets massive publicity. If somebody else does it, nobody cares."}
{"text": "Sometimes, before I interview new patients, while Im waiting for them to be transported from the emergency department to the medical floor, I play a game.I look through their lab tests. I peruse their imaging studies. I read other doctors notes and recent discharge summaries. Then I guess what the diagnosis is.I know this is bad. It goes against most of what I learned about good doctoring in medical school  that the patients story is the core of medicine, that its essential for accurate diagnoses and therapeutic relationships.It can also be dangerous. When I interview patients, I often find their medical charts are littered with inaccuracies. Its one reason read it in my chart isnt a good way for patients to communicate health information  or for doctors to learn it.I noticed youre scheduled for surgery next week, I say to one patient.I had that surgery three months ago, he responds.So you dont have diabetes? I ask another, perplexed. I see diabetes clearly indicated in her chart.No! Why does everyone keep asking me that? she exclaims, exasperated.When I read a patients electronic health record, I now assume whats written there is as likely to be wrong or outdated as it is to be accurate. Sometimes these discrepancies are minor and inconsequential; sometimes they can be devastating. And unlike what happens in Vegas, whats written in your medical record often stays with you forever.One study found that theres complete agreement between medications listed in the electronic health record and what patients actually take only in about 5 percent of patients. Another study found that 43 percent of medications listed in the electronic health record were inaccurate  with 29 percent having been stopped and 14 percent changed. Many allergies and adverse drug reactions arent recorded. Research from the Veterans Health Administration found that 60 percent of patient records had at least one error. From 2013 to 2014, the percentage of lawsuits related to electronic health record issues doubled and is expected to rise.The ease with which doctors can copy and paste the information in a medical record can be one source of error  as well as a potent source of note bloat: notes so filled with extraneous information that you have to scroll through pages and pages of nonsense to find anything useful. Almost all doctors use the copy-paste function when writing notes, and by some estimates between half and three-quarters of daily notes are copied text. There are advantages: Forwarding text for stable patients can be safe and efficient  and a  majority of doctors believe it doesnt hurt patients. But, if not done carefully, it can perpetuate false or outdated material.Another problem is that large amounts of patient information are now automatically imported into patient notes. Cognitively, its a very different experience searching for, confirming and personally recording aspects of a patients history than it is reviewing whats auto-populated into your note. In some cases, one can write an entire note simply by clicking a few boxes to indicate the duration and frequency of a patients symptoms  essentially the same way you fill in a Mad Libs templateWhat can get lost in all this is the patients story.Eliciting, distilling and communicating an account of whats happened in a persons life are skills that are vital for all doctors, but especially for doctors in training still learning to care for patients. Gathering and sharing a patients story offers the fullest sense of who a patient is as a human being, why he might have received this treatment, for example, and not that one, and what the best course of action might be going forward. We now spend two hours a day reporting quality measures, but what needs to be mandatory in the age of digitalization is the art of story gathering and storytelling.One solution may be to encourage more patients to read their medical records. Doctors may be motivated to write more thoughtful and accurate notes if they know their patients will be reading them. While patients have had the right to access their medical records since 1996, when the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was enacted, and the right to electronic copies since 2009, most patients never see their charts.Research suggests that only about 40 percent of patients are offered online access to their medical records. Of those given access, only half choose to view them  but 80 percent of those who do find it useful. A quarter of patients remain unaware of their right to an electronic copy of their medical records. But patients who frequently access their medical records may be more motivated to take control of their health  and in a better position to correct outdated or erroneous information.The federal government recently released guidelines making it easier for patients to access their records, requiring hospitals to provide electronic copies within 30 days of a request and prohibiting them from asking patients to state a reason for their requests. The governments Blue Button Initiative also aims to empower patients, allowing them to directly download personal health data in an easy-to-read format.The push to digitize health care has its upsides. But whats too easily forgotten is the patients story, a coherent narrative of who a person is and what he or she has been through. As medicine continues to modernize, we cant afford to lose this ancient art.Dhruv Khullar, M.D., M.P.P. is a resident physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.

{"text": "You wouldnt guess from the luxurious parquet wood floor, but the South London studio of the British ceramist Katharine Morling sits in a former government building. When I first moved here 12 years ago, I just had a strip of space, says Morling, gesturing to the corner of her now roomy workshop at Cockpit Arts in Deptford, a thriving creative community thats home to some 65 artists and designers. (She is sandwiched between a guitar-maker and a wood-turner.) There are shelves full of the unglazed, ink-drawn pieces for which Morling, who lives just 10 minutes away along the river in Greenwich, has become known and which will be on view beginning today at Bergdorf Goodman.The making is the best part for me, says the artist, who is currently in the process of mapping out a new piece that centers on a group of figures in action, some in boats, some waiting at a station. Ill just start with that loose idea and build it up from there. Its then that the sketches, and other photocopied ephemera of everything from British birds to anatomical figures to the markings of the Holly Blue butterfly, come into play.The daughter of a single mother who worked as a bookkeeper, there was little room in Morlings childhood for artistic pursuits. It was all very practical and basic, she explains, as her own 7-month-old baby, Rosie, gurgles in her playpen in the corner of the studio. From very early on, I knew I wanted to be an artist. It wasnt encouraged, but I was determined. I was very severely dyslexic, so it was the only thing I could do at school.It wasnt until her mid-20s, while training to be an arts therapist, that Morling found her craft. I kept walking past the ceramics classroom and theyd put all the students old work in the window, she says. I was fascinated by the sheer variety. You can do anything in ceramics  any color, any style  it was so exciting to me. She signed up and fast became the star pupil. Her first freestyle pieces were sea anemones in lurid, drippy glazes that sold out and won her the attention of a local gallery.Some years later, Morling was studying ceramics at the Royal College of Art in London when she discovered the essence of her now signature monochromatic and un-shiny style: Its drawing, she says. But drawing you can walk around. My brain works spatially. So she brings her sketchbook to life with 3D ceramic sculptures, which come together to tell a carefully crafted narrative.Though much of her work features tangible everyday objects  a typewriter titled Poison Pen is a commentary on her experiences with dyslexia  there is also a strong reference to animal life, which Morling traces back to free-reign visits to her childhood best friends family zoo in Wales. Butterflies encased in glass boxes are the creation of an imaginary figure called Nature Boy, a troubled adolescent who is pinning down the beauty in the botanical world in search of lifes meaning. Hes armed, naturally, with a rucksack filled with necessities like a camera, all of which Morling has constructed in life-size porcelain form. A single work can necessitate the making of literally hundreds of tiny coins or nails or matchsticks  each one hand-rolled, double-kiln fired and most often, extraordinarily delicate.Its a hazardous path to a completed piece: Porcelain naturally melts in the kiln, so if Morlings complex constructions are not supported in exactly the right way, its game over. Even if they survive the first firing, they could crack during the final one. The toughest test of all though is whether a work gets her own aesthetic approval: Sometimes Ill make things and theyre really wrong, says Morling, who has no qualms about taking her hammer to smash the rejects to prevent people ferreting in the bins for the remnants as theyve been known to do. It could be something Ive spent weeks on, but if its not right I dont want it out there in the world."}

The equally inexperienced young owner of Margaux, Corinne Mentzelopoulos, hired him.Put it down to the natural confidence of youth, Mr. Pontallier told wine-searcher.com last year, reflecting on the audacity of seeking such a job. I have always been quite ambitious and wanted to work with a leading property from the outset.Few names are more magical in the history of wine than Margaux. The chateau traces its roots to the 16th century, when the de Lestonnac family set up the 650-acre estate, 230 of the acres covered with vines, more or less as it exists today. By the 18th century, Margaux was considered one of the worlds great wines, with Thomas Jefferson and Prime Minister Sir Robert Walpole of Britain among its ardent fans.In 1855, the leading Bordeaux producers were classified according to reputation, price and taste, a ranking that is still influential today. Margaux was one of four chateaus named in the top level, or first growth, along with Lafite, Latour and Haut-Brion, later to be joined by Mouton Rothschild in 1973.Despite its history and reputation, Margaux was in shambles in the 1970s. A recession and a succession of disastrous vintages had left the owners, the Ginestet family, deeply in debt, with Margaux their prize asset. In 1977, Margaux was sold to Andr Mentzelopoulos, a grocery store magnate. He immediately began investing heavily in the estate. When Mr. Mentzelopoulos died in 1980, his daughter Corinne, just 27, took charge.When Mr. Pontallier was hired, his background was more academic than practical. He held a doctorate from the Bordeaux Institute of Oenology, where he had studied with the renowned oenologist mile Peynaud and written a dissertation on the barrel aging of red wines. Mr. Pontallier had also just returned from national service in Chile, most of which he had spent teaching oenology in Santiago. When he joined Margaux, restoration projects were underway, and the great 1982 vintage was propelling the region toward prosperity. Mr. Pontallier took part in efforts to replant the vineyard and improve drainage, to renovate the cellar and rethink the winemaking operation.During this time he worked again with Mr. Peynaud, who had been hired as a consultant, and he developed a symbiotic working partnership with Ms. Mentzelopoulos. In 1990 she named him managing director of Margaux, a position he held until he died. Mr. Pontalliers academic training shaped his work at Margaux. He based each important decision on empirical observation and experiment, said Philippe Bascaules, his longtime assistant, who is now the winemaker at Inglenook in the Napa Valley of California.What I learned from him was doubt and humility, Mr. Bascaules said. He said many times, If you dont doubt, you dont learn. Doubt was the beginning of research.Humility, Mr. Bascaules said, came in recognizing that at Margaux, the place  what Mr. Pontallier once referred to as the dictatorship of great terroir  was more important than human activity, and should be given the utmost respect.How did Mr. Pontallier and his team decide which young wines would go into Margaux, and which would not make the cut and would instead be used for the estates second label, Pavillon Rouge? We taste, he said in 1995. We taste, we taste, we taste.Fashions in wine came and went during his tenure. In the 1990s, Mr. Pontallier experimented with new technologies, like reverse osmosis and micro-oxygenation, but ultimately rejected them. Many producers in Bordeaux strove to make their wines more concentrated and powerful, but for Mr. Pontallier, elegance and balance were the hallmarks of Margaux.Indeed, the best vintages of Chteau Margaux display freshness, grace, vibrancy and a sort of intensity without weight. When young, they smelled of spicy red fruit, violets and herbs. As they aged they developed perfumed aromas of graphite, tobacco and cedar, and like all the best Bordeaux they improved for decades. A 1961 Margaux, tasted in 2013, was lovely, graceful and harmonious.Outside of Margaux, Mr. Pontallier consulted at wine projects in France, in Chile and on the North Fork of Long Island, where for a decade beginning in 1997 he advised the winemaker at Raphael, Richard Olsen-Harbich, on farming and winemaking.Paul Pontallier was born on April 22, 1956, in Bordeaux, and grew up not far from the city, where his parents grew grapes and made wine at Chteau la Loge Saint-Lger. It was not particularly profitable, Mr. Pontallier later recalled, and his father would have preferred that he take up another profession. But he had a passion for farming and studied agronomy, viticulture and oenology, first in Paris, then in Montpellier and later in Bordeaux.His survivors include his wife, Batrice, and four children, Guillaume, Thibault (who also works for Margaux), Alice and Antoine.In recent years Mr. Pontallier spent much of his time as a traveling ambassador, spreading his passion for Margaux throughout the world, especially in Asia, which since the turn of the century has rapidly grown as a market for fine French wines. He also oversaw the construction of a new cellar and winemaking facility, designed by Norman Foster.In person, Mr. Pontallier was very much like Margaux wines, gracious and elegant. He enjoyed reading about history and liked to drink good Burgundy and sherry. But when asked recently what he would prefer for his last meal, he said the food did not matter, as long as it came with several bottles of Chteau Margaux."}
{"text": "To the Editor:Re Obama Takes Crusade Against Opioids on Road (news article, March 30): While I was heartened to see that, finally, the administration is stepping up to face the dire epidemic of drug overdose deaths in America, I cannot help but wonder why it took so long.My 22-year-old son is part of the grim 2014 statistic: 28,648 drug deaths from opioids. He died from an accidental heroin overdose in September 2014. His story echoes a familiar tale of the progression from easily accessible prescription painkillers to heroin. And, like many others, he was a sweet, handsome and intelligent young man whose life, dreams and soul were ripped away by the disease of addiction. He was also part of a treatment process that criminalized him  in and out of treatment programs, finally receiving medication for his addiction but unsupervised.Addiction is a disease and needs to be treated like any other public health problem reaching epidemic proportions. I keep staring at the 2014 opioid death map accompanying your article and focusing on the red mass in the state where my son and many others died.I wonder: Why has it taken the opioid overdose death toll to surpass that of traffic accidents in order to be, in Mr. Obamas words, right at the top of our radar screen?JUDITH SHARLINHighland Beach, Fla.To the Editor:Re Heroin Yields Ground to Fentanyl, Its More Potent Killer Cousin (front page, March 26):The influx of fentanyl as an additive to heroin and as a free-standing active killer is a scary reminder that the drug epidemic must be addressed from the demand side as well as the supply. Supply-side strategies that rely on law enforcement, opioid prescription restrictions and international cooperation are necessary but not sufficient to reduce and reverse our national scourge of substance use disorder.The demand-side focus relies on prevention and public education and awareness. We need adequately funded media campaigns that target those who are most vulnerable to addiction, including middle-school students and teenagers, returning military veterans, people who have exhausted their medical prescriptions and other high-risk populations.Two coming events offer opportunities to launch such campaigns. From April 19 to 21, the United Nations General Assembly Special Session on the world drug problem will convene in New York to consider multiple options to address addiction and treatment. Later this year, the United States surgeon general, Vivek Murthy, will release the first-ever Surgeon Generals Report on Substance Use, Addiction and Health.These two events will provide high-visibility platforms that could save the lives and futures of millions of people here and abroad.DON MATHISHavre de Grace, Md.The writer is a board member of Doctors for America.To the Editor:Re A Strong Response to the Opioid Scourge (editorial, March 17):The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has done a disservice to people living with intractable chronic pain with its latest one-sided recommendations for reducing opiate overuse  recommendations that you praise.I worked in a drug treatment facility and have seen the ravages of addiction, and I know the risks of opiate use. When I suffered multiple severe injuries from a fall, I tried every treatment I could find to reduce my suffering without narcotics. None came close to reducing it to a tolerable level. Grudgingly, I came to the conclusion that pain medicines were going to have to be part of my comprehensive approach to pain management.There is a legitimate use for pain meds for treating chronic pain; it is absolutely wrong to suggest that most chronic pain can be adequately treated without narcotics. It is time the C.D.C. took a more balanced look at both sides of this complicated issue and not let the fear of one group override the legitimate lifesaving use by another.SCOTT McLAINOlympia, Wash.To the Editor:Re Towns Anti-Drug Plan: Safe Site to Use Heroin (front page, March 23), about a proposal by the mayor of Ithaca, N.Y., to establish the first site in the United States where people could legally inject heroin:Supervised injection facilities, or SIFs, are a longstanding public health tool in several countries and are rapidly gaining support elsewhere, including in the United States. Advocates like me understand why people have questions about something that at first pass looks as if it enables destructive behavior.Most people who inject drugs cannot immediately cease drug use, and SIFs keep people safe while connecting them to care. Study after study has shown that SIFs reduce overdose deaths, H.I.V. and viral hepatitis transmission, and public disorder, and increase access to drug treatment and other health care.SIFs also offer compassion and dignity for people who are the subject of societys worst scapegoating and stigmatization. Its that kind of support, not punishment by the criminal justice system, that ultimately helps people become well.MATT CURTISNew YorkThe writer is policy director at VOCAL New York, an advocacy organization that helps lead the campaign for SIFs in New York."}
{"text": "GENEVA  The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, on Wednesday exhorted countries around the world to step up to their responsibilities and take in half a million Syrian refugees, rebuking political leaders who he said had instead resorted to demonizing asylum seekers.Opening a one-day ministerial conference in Geneva convened by the United Nations refugee agency, Mr. Ban called for an exponential increase in global solidarity in urging countries to accept about 480,000 Syrians over the next three years.Neighboring countries have done far more than their share, Mr. Ban said, alluding to the nearly five million refugees received by Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq. Others must now step up.Demonizing refugees and migrants was not only demeaning, offensive and counterproductive but factually wrong, Mr. Ban said, emphasizing the skills and other resources they brought to host countries. I call on leaders to counter fearmongering with reassurance, and to fight inaccurate information with the truth.The 480,000 Syrian refugees amount to about 10 percent of those registered in surrounding countries. Counting pledges to resettle 179,000 refugees the United Nations refugee agency has received since 2013, that meant it was looking for commitments to take an additional 300,000 people.That target proved far beyond the scope of the meeting. Mr. Bans appeal elicited many pledges of support and solidarity but adding up the commitments made on Wednesday, Filippo Grandi, head of the refugee agency, said the meeting had raised the number of places pledged for Syrians by some six thousand, although other promises could open the way for tens of thousands more.United Nations officials had expected little else, stressing the Geneva meeting marked the start of a longer term process aimed at recalibrating the global response to a crisis that has generated the highest levels of displacement since World War II.Within all the gloom and doom of Syria it was a positive meeting; I come out of it with a lot of confidence, Volker Turk, assistant high commissioner of the refugee agency, said. It has generated a positive momentum for the year.That is expected to become clear in a series of high level meetings later this year, starting with the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in May; a summit on the refugee crisis at the General Assembly in New York in September; and a summit meeting that President Obama will convene the next day, which is intended to generate firm commitments on humanitarian financing and refugee resettlement.Still, the studiously general comments ministers and officials delivered in Geneva on Wednesday underscored the gap between the humanitarian needs in what Mr. Ban called the greatest refugee crisis since 1945 and what governments were prepared to offer.International donors meeting in London in February had pledged $12 billion in humanitarian aid for Syrian refugees and the countries receiving them, but Mr. Grandi said less than half the funds had been allocated so far, calling for speedier disbursement.Much more is needed, Mr. Grandi told the meeting. European Union countries had not shown the required solidarity to share the resettlement of refugees, he said. We cannot respond to a global refugee crisis by closing doors and building fences.More than a million migrants reached European shores last year, and the European Union has struggled to come up with a coherent and effective response.Europe was ready to take its fair share, the European Unions commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, told the conference, but he sketched opportunities for resettlement that appeared to fall well short of what the United Nations was seeking. Eleven European Union countries had agreed to accept 4,555 refugees under a program established in July, which would eventually bring in a total of 22,504 people, he said.Mr. Avramopoulos also proposed that union member states accept 54,000 Syrians under another program agreed upon last September that provided for relocating a total of 160,000 refugees.Six months later, that program has relocated just several hundred people, but Mr. Turk said the European Union statement would increase pressure on Europe to fulfill its commitments. There is a high expectation this is now going to be delivered in real terms and its not just a fiction, he said.For the United States, Deputy Secretary of State Heather A. Higginbottom said the Obama administration had increased the number of interviewing officials at refugee processing centers in the region so that it could resettle at least 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of September.The Russian deputy foreign minister, Gennady Gatilov, calling on European countries to show more responsibility in dealing with the refugee crisis, said Moscow had doubled the number of places for Syrians to receive free university education  to 300."}
{"text": "BEIJING  Youre moving to China with your family, and youre excited but also concerned: What might the countrys notorious smog do to your and your childrens lungs?Heres how you can feel the fear and move to China anyway, while minimizing your health risks:Relocate to Guangzhou, the capital of the southern province of Guangdong, near Hong Kong. Second best: move to Shanghai.Dont move to Beijing, Chengdu or Shenyang, if you can help it.Those are some conclusions to be drawn from a new study of air quality in five major cities by a team of researchers at Peking University led by Chen Songxi, a statistician at the universitys Guanghua School of Management.In an interview, Mr. Chen said the study was prompted by a sense of disgust at air pollution. I felt that as scientists we should do something about the situation facing a billion Chinese people, he said.There was both good and bad news in the report, titled Air Quality Assessment Report (2): A Statistical Analysis of Air Pollution in Five Chinese Cities and published online.The team scrutinized three years of air quality data for the measure known as PM 2.5, the fine particulate matter that is especially hazardous to health. One source of the data was the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection. The other was the United States Embassy in Beijing and consulates in Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Shenyang.By using two independent data sets, the researchers answered a second question: Is the Chinese governments air quality data trustworthy? The answer: Yes, at least in these five cities. That was one piece of good news.China began releasing PM 2.5 figures for hundreds of locations in 2013, five years after the United States Embassy began publishing readings from monitors on its grounds that drew wide attention among Chinese. Suspicions linger to this day about the reliability of the Chinese government data.Another piece of good news: PM 2.5 levels declined over the last three years in all five cities. In Beijing, they fell from 99 micrograms per cubic meter to 81, and in Shanghai from 61 to 50. In Guangzhou, they fell from 54 to 39.That was because of two factors: stricter emissions regulations that took effect on Jan. 1, 2015, and a slowing economy.The economic downturn helped, Mr. Chen said.But there was bad news, too. In all five cities, the air pollution readings remained higher than the World Health Organizations upper safety limit of 35 micrograms of PM 2.5 per cubic meter.China uses a considerably more liberal standard, classifying up to 75 micrograms as good. Many readings regularly exceeded that.The researchers defined a level of under 35 as good, and under 75 as light pollution, and found that Guangzhou and Shanghai had the most good or light days. About 80 percent of days each year fell into those categories. Chengdu and Shenyang had about 60 percent. Beijing came last with 50 percent.In addition, Beijing and Chengdu suffered the most prolonged spells of heavy pollution, which the team defined as readings of 150 or higher. Even Shanghai and Guangzhou did not have more than 37 percent good air days.This shows the grave challenge facing China in its air pollution prevention efforts, the report says.Mr. Chens interest was ignited after a colleague in the United States sent him a link in 2013 to the Real-Time Air Quality Index with data from Beijing.The more I looked at it, the more disgusted I felt, Mr. Chen said. Then, on a very polluted day in early March of 2014, I said, I have to do something. I called together a team.To test the accuracy of the Chinese government data, the researchers used readings from two or three ministry monitors in each city as close as possible to the American sites. They found a high similarity, the report says.They show a lot of consistency, Mr. Chen said. They wont be exactly the same, because of data randomness and because theyre not at exactly the same locations.If they were still manipulating the data, that would be really hopeless and Id leave China, he said. But it does show that the government and the Ministry of Environmental Protection are serious.Still, there were significant data problems on the Chinese side, he said.The Ministry of Environmental Protection website gives hourly readings, but it doesnt provide historical data, Mr. Chen said. You have to grab it, hour by hour. The government wants to do something about this, but not 100 percent.The report recommends improving data collection and publication.The team also factored in meteorological factors and consumption of coal, petroleum and diesel to get a better picture of the relations among emissions, weather and pollution. But here too they encountered a lack of information.The economic and energy data are very sparse, Mr. Chen said. We couldnt find data on consumption, especially of petroleum products. We dont know how much gasoline was sold in 2013, and we think petroleum products may be a bigger problem than coal in Beijing.Asked where a family moving to China should settle to minimize exposure to polluted air, Mr. Chen said, I grew up in Beijing and I love Beijing, so you put me in a very hard position.The North China Plain, where Beijing is, and the Sichuan Basin, where Chengdu is, are not good places to be. Theyre not suitable for heavy industry, Mr. Chen said. Their physical settings trap pollutants. If you have heavy industry there, this is what youll get.Shanghai and Guangzhou are more fortunate, he said, because theyre close to the sea and have more rainfall.Beijings saving grace: a strong northwesterly wind in winter that helps clear the air. But that doesnt address the source of the problem. Another recommendation: reduce emissions.The core of the problem is you have to cut down emissions, Mr. Chen said. People blame the weather, but actually they should blame emissions."}
