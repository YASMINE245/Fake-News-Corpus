In an effort to further prevent the spread of the Zika virus, the Centers for Disease Control on Tuesday issued a new travel advisory asking Americans who plan to travel to Central and South America this summer to pack plenty of cigarettes and tonic water.\nCigarette smoking actually has some health benefits in that in that it works as a natural deterrent to mosquitoes, Dr. Raymond Goodwin, an infectious disease specialist at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, explained. When you exhale tobacco smoke, you are  in a sense  creating a temporary force field around your body which mosquitoes are simply unable to penetrate.\nThe CDC is asking those who are traveling to regions and countries where Zika is most prevalent, including Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Haiti, Honduras, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico, to consider postponing travel plans until more is known about the virus.\nIn the event travel is unavoidable, Dr. Goodwin said Americans  particularly pregnant women  who visit the affected regions should make a concentrated effort to smoke as many cigarettes as possible throughout the duration of their trip. If youre outdoors or in an area where mosquitoes are common, the best line of defense is frequent consumption of tonic water coupled with incessant smoking, Goodwin advised. Also, consider lathering yourself in bug spray and, if you can, keep a citronella candle burning nearby at all times.\nDr. Goodwin said by adhering to the necessary precautions, travelers are far less likely to contract the Zika virus through a mosquito bite. However, the CDC warns the possibility of catching it through sexual transmission remains high.\nTo further assist travelers in the protecting themselves against the Zika virus, the CDC, working in conjunction with the Transportation Security Administration, is issuing one free carton of Marlboro brand cigarettes to travelers who are destined for Central and South America for trips lasting one week or less.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "In an effort to further prevent the spread of the Zika virus, the Centers for Disease Control on Tuesday issued a new travel advisory asking Americans..."}

The historic agreement is the result of a years worth ofunpublicized talks between Protestant leaders and the Vatican.\nProminent American pastors Joel Osteen and Rick Warren, respectively, as well as Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, were among the Protestant delegation that met with Pope Francis lastweek. Pastor Warren, founder of Saddleback Church in Lake Forest,California, spoke with members of the international press in St.Peters Square, saying, Protestants, as a people, have a long historyof heresy. The time for reconciliation is now in order to ensure afull and dogmatic transition into the folds of the Church.\nMoments before meeting with reporters, the entire Protestantdelegation, for the first time ever, entered the confessional to takepart, individually, in the Sacrament of Penance. Its important thatwe participate in these sacred rituals before asking our congregation to do the same, Pastor Osteen said, adding that his time inconfession was an immensely moving experience.\nAs Protestants around the world make the transition to Catholicism,many are wondering what, exactly, that means for them. First andforemost we acknowledge the Popes infallibility with regard touniversal moral declarations, the authority of Church magistrate,faith, and ex cathedra, said Father Cliff Brogan, a former Protestantpastor who was the first of the delegation to be ordained as a priestat the Vatican. Secondly, we participate in the sacrament of theEucharist by accepting the actual body and blood of Christ, an eventknown as Transubstantiation, at the conclusion of the holy mass.\nAs part of their induction into the Catholic faith, all Protestantsabove the age of fifteen are required to undergo a CatholicConfirmation, one of three sacraments of initiation, out of seven total, which Catholics can receive. Most, if not all, of us have beenbaptized, said Father Brogran. However, without formal Confirmation,our Protestant baptisms will be null, thus preventing us from enteringthe Kingdom of Heaven.\nAdditionally, during the transition period, American Protestantfamilies whose children attend Sunday School are to receive vouchersallowing them to participate in CCD programs at area Catholicchurches.\nIn a show of support for the reunification under the Holy See, theUnited Kingdom announced Wednesday that it is taking steps to reunifyNorthern Ireland with The Republic of Ireland.

However, I dont think the answer is to continue stonewalling the inevitable. The president, who previously expressed support for the demonstrations, called the pipeline an important and necessary part of American infrastructure, saying, This is something that will enhance and strengthen our nation for generations to come.\nThe writ of habeas corpus, which grants prisoners or detainees the right to challenge the legality of their imprisonment, is covered in the Suspension Clause of the U.S. Constitution under Article One and, as such, shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\nFor federal authorities in North Dakota, the writs suspension allows for far greater powers in terms of arrest and detainment of protesters, journalists, and other disruptive individuals. Whether they admit it or not, a lot of these people who have presented themselves as reporters are actively taking steps to impede the construction of this pipeline, said Major General Arnold Dohlmann of the North Dakota Army National Guard. Backed by force of fifteen hundred seasoned soldiers, Maj, Gen. Dohlmann is set to assume command of law enforcement operations in Morton County immediately following President Obamas suspension of habeas corpus on Monday.\nAs it stands, my orders are to detain anyone suspected of interfering with the continued efforts by Energy Transfer Partners and their respective contractors to install the Dakota Access Pipeline. Further, Ive received authorization from the White House to hold these individuals until construction of the pipeline is completed. Maj. Gen. Dohlmann said the Army National Guard is in the process of erecting two temporary internment facilities on the outskirts of Morton County where detainees will be held pending the pipelines completion. Citing the need for operational security, Dohlmann declined to specify the exact location of the internment facilities.\nThe decision by the Obama administration comes at a time when clashes between demonstrators and local authorities have reached an all-time high.

In response to a question regarding his policy on ISIS, Republican presidential candidate and billionaireDonald Trump told Meet the Press on Sunday that as Commander-in-Chief, he would authorize the use of nuclear weapons to combat Islamic extremism. Lets face it, these people are barbarians, Trump said. And thanks to Obamas failed policy in Iraq and Syria, theyre beheading Christians all over the world.\nMr. Trump said hes already conferred with a number of high-level active military officials and has put together a comprehensive strategy to defeat the Islamic State within his first one hundred days in office. It starts with the deployment of four or five of our Ohio-class nuclear submarines to the Persian Gulf, Trump said. Were going to hit them and were going to hit them hard. Im talking about a surgical strike on these ISIS stronghold cities using Trident missiles.\nThe Trident is a submarine-launched ballistic missile equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, or MIRVs. With a payload of up to fourteen reentry vehicles, each carrying a 362-pound thermonuclear warhead with a yield of 100 kilotons, a single Trident has roughly seventy times the destructive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.\nTrumps plan to use thermonuclear weapons against ISIS-held areas such as the Syrian city of Al-Raqqahwould result in an astronomically high number of civilian casualties, according to CNN military analyst Peter Mansoor. Al-Raqqah alone has a population of over two hundred-thousand people, the vast majority of whom are not affiliated in any way with the Islamic State, Mansoor said. A strike of this magnitude would not only result in the loss of millions of innocent lives and infrastructure, but it would set diplomacy and stability in the region back at least a hundred years.\nCivilian casualties are an unfortunate reality of war according to Trump, who justified the use of nuclear weapons saying they send a clear message to those who conspire against America and her allies. Mr. Trump said that unlike past and present administrations, he possesses the moral fortitude to do what must be done to protect America. Were losing to China. Were losing to Mexico. We will not lose to ISIS, Trump said.\nThe Japanese and other nations called for increased restrictions on nuclear weapons Sunday as the world observed the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States.

Touching on Operation Wetback,a controversial 1950s deportation policy which Mr. Trump has voiced strong support for, the GOPs leading candidate proposed a solution that he would immediately implement if elected.\nTrumps plan takes the positive aspects from a number of previous immigration policies dating back to the start of World War II, including theinternment of Japanese Americansfollowing the bombing of Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. In order to deport the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants living in the United States, we need to have an established system in place.

The Virginia Department of Transportation has approved a $491.5 million plan to install bicycle-friendly lanes along portions of I-495 and I-95 in Northern Virginia and parts of the Washington metropolitan area, a spokesperson for VDOT announced on Tuesday.\nThe fact of the matter is that we as a society are becoming increasingly eco-conscious and passionate about preserving our environment and as a result, more and more people are seeking out non-motorized transportation as a means of travel, Ned Meeks, the projects lead developer, told the Washington Business Journal. Right now, we have no real means of streamlining long-distance travel for the tens of thousands of people who rely on bicycles as their primary mode of transportation.\nAn avid cyclist and Share the Road advocate, Meeks vision for the Capital Beltway will become a reality in the coming months. At a cost to taxpayers of less than half a billion dollars, the project will involve expanding portions of the Beltway to allow for a 1.5 meter-wide path between the outside lane and shoulder where cyclists can travel at high speeds alongside the flow of motor vehicle traffic.\nIn an effort to remain below the already steep budget, Meeks said developers decided to scrap the more aesthetic features of the bike lane such as a protective barrier that would serve to separate cyclists from the highway. Generally speaking, this is something that youre more likely to see in an urban environment, Meeks said, continuing, From the beginning we approached this project from a minimalist viewpoint. You arent going to see a lot of unnecessary elements like illumination lights, protective barriers, or rest areas. This is purely a means of long distance rapid transportation.\nVDOT officials say construction for the Capital Beltway bike lane is set to commence on February 6th. Commuters should expect delays and exercise caution, particularly while driving along the highways twenty-two mile stretch in Northern Virginia where construction crews will be present day and night expanding the road and laying down paint.\nWhile the project is only expected to take about a month to complete, Meeks said his mission is far from over. The two-time triathlon winner turned visionary developer hopes more states will adopt similar high-speed bike lanes along their highways.In order to fully embrace this idea that bicyclists and motorists can share the road together, the biking community must have access to all roads  regardless of size and traffic flow, Meeks argued.

More than 43,000 worshipers were in attendance at Lakewood Church Saturday evening when Joel Osteen, Lakewoods Senior Pastor, reportedly levitated nearly ten feet above the stage following the conclusion of his sermon. People were hysterical, said Maya Rodriguez, who, like thousands of others in the Houston area, attends weekly services at the nondenominational megachurch.\nWitnesses say roughly forty-five minutes into the 7 P.M. service, Pastor Osteen suddenly appeared disoriented before suffering a violent coughing fit. His forehead and neck were just drenched in sweat, said Colton Bradshaw, a Houston native, who was seated with his wife in the second row. The events that followed, according to Bradshaw and corroborated by more than a thousand other witnesses, left worshipers feeling perplexed and, in many cases, terrified.\nOsteen reportedly fell to his knees on stage while clutching his chest. We thought he was having a heart attack, Bradshaw said. It was then that the charismatic pastor outstretched his arms, threw his head back, and violently arched his back. Dozens of cellphone videos taken by parishioners and uploaded to the popular media website YouTube show Pastor Osteen, seemingly in a trance-like state, rise from the stage. Screams and cries of disbelief from the congregation can be heard as Osteen levitates more than nine feet off the ground.\nIn one of the higher quality videos uploaded to YouTube by userTheChristianBlessing,Osteen can be seen hovering above the stage with his head slumped forward before, as one witness put it, suddenly awakening. As Pastor Osteen appears to hang with his arms outstretched in midair, he opens his mouth and, in a deep, commanding voice, says, I am the Alpha and the Omega. Then, his body drops like a rag doll to the ground where he remains motionless.\nColton Bradshaws wife, Karen, along with dozens of other worshipers, fainted during the ordeal and later required medical attention, but Bradshaw himself remained alert throughout the entire spectacle, which lasted less than four minutes. When he spoke those words from the Book of Revelations, Bradshaw later recalled, It wasnt his voice that spoke them. It was not Pastor Osteen speaking. The sound of that voice reverberated through the stadium. For as long as I live, Ill never forget it.\nParamedics arrived at Lakewood Church at 8:05 P.M. and treated Osteen on the scene. The pastor suffered a mild concussion brought by the nearly ten foot free fall to the stage floor but was otherwise unhurt, save for some minor bruising to his forehead. A spokesman for the megachurch told Fox 26 Houston that Mr. Osteen has no memory of the events that occurred prior to regaining consciousness.\nDoctors and medical staff at the Texas Medical Center on Holcombe Boulevard in Houston were overwhelmed Saturday night as they treated approximately six hundred and fifty people, many of whom were in a state of shock after witnessing the event. Lakewood Church boasts one of the largest congregations in the United States and reaches an estimated 27 million people worldwide each week. In 1999, Joel Osteen replaced his father, John Osteen, who founded the church in 1959, as Senior Pastor.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Lakewood's Senior Pastor, Joel Osteen reportedly levitated nearly ten feet above the stage following the conclusion of his sermon."}

A seemingly run-of-the-mill email exchange uncovered in Wikileaks most recent release of hacked Podesta emails sheds light on the staggering extent of former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clintons frivolous spending habits on Amazon and other web-based retail outlets.\nThis is beyond anything weve ever seen, political analyst and former Republican strategist H. Roman Brewer told MSNBCs Brian Williams on Thursday. Brewer and his team have spent the last week combing through thousands of Amazon confirmation emails that were forwarded by Hillary Clinton to campaign chair John Podestas email account. In 2015, Mrs. Clinton spent more than $340,000 on cat grooming products and accessories alone, said Brewer. The frightening thing is she doesnt have an Amazon Prime account so shes gotta be paying through the roof on shipping costs.\nHowever, Mrs. Clintons extraneous spending isnt limited to cyber purchases. According to a set of overlooked emails included in Wikileaks March 2016 release, the Clintons used funds from their non-profit foundation to have the basement of their multi-million dollar home in Chappaqua, New York, carpeted with sisal fabric  a material associated with cat scratching posts  and outfitted with wall-to-wall cat jungle gyms. Completed in April of 2015, just days before Clinton announced her bid for the presidency, the $1.8 million basement renovations included a 2,4000 square-foot living space meant to accommodate more than three dozen cats.\nBill and Hillary have gone to great lengths to keep their pets out of the public eye, explained Bob Wagner, a private investigator hired in 2007 by the Edwards campaign to look in to the Clintons private life. They stopped registering their pets with the state of New York after Bill left office in 2001, Wagner told The Washington Examiner.\nWagner and others have raised speculation over whether the secrecy surrounding the Clintons house pets could be due to the possibility that the felines have been used as a form of payment for services rendered by the Clinton Foundation. A string of emails between John Podesta and Huma Abedin seem to suggest as much, said H. Roman Brewer. There was some discussion about a recent gift from the state of Qatar in the form of three ashera cats.

The Syrian people have already suffered enough at the hands of Islamic extremists, Churkin told reporters. To add insult to injury, many are being forced to pay out-of-pocket for healthcare.\nSince March of 2011, an estimated 430,000 Syrians have been killed as a consequence of a civil war between Russian-backed government forces and Islamic militants. As a result of the ongoing conflict, Syrias once state-of-the-art healthcare system is in shambles.

Kim was providing on the spot guidance to a group of football players near the Kim Il-sung Stadium when he was struck in the head by a bullet.\nDespite the North Korean regimes best efforts, word of the assassination spread like wildfire throughout the Korean peninsula causing South Korea to deploy additional ground units to the Demilitarized Zone and place their military on high alert. China has reportedly taken similar steps, sending artillery and mechanized units to its border with North Korea.\nPresident Obama has yet to publicly comment on the assassination, but the Central Intelligence Agency, in a rare and unprecedented statement, said the three-generation Kim leadership, dating back to the Korean War, has been receiving covert assistance from the agency. The CIA did not elaborate on the level of support, only referring to it as an experiment.\nThese damning implications raise new questions about who is ultimately responsible for the crimes and atrocities committed by the North Korean regime over the last sixty years. The country has remained in near-total isolation since 1945 when Kim Il-sung, a possible CIA operative, took control of the upper Korean peninsula. Kim Il-sung developed a cult of personality which was passed along to his son Kim Jong-il and finally, grandson, Kim Jong-un. Using fear and intimidation combined with various forms of mind control, which the CIA itself briefly experimented with in the 1950s, the Kim Dynasty was able to subdue the North Korean people for over half a century.\nA high ranking official with the Department of Defense, speaking on condition of anonymity, told this reporter that the United States is quietly deploying three carrier groups to the Sea of Japan.

A former au pair for the Trump family told theNew York Post on Friday that Republican presidential candidate and former reality TV star Donald J. Trump refused to speak to his eldest daughter, Ivanka, for nearly nine months after losing a heated game of Monopoly to her in the summer of 1994.\nMr. Trump was very adamant that the game had been rigged against him, Maria Gomez told thePost. He said the dice had weights in them and that nobody ever lands on Boardwalk. Mrs. Gomez, who served as Ivankas live-in nanny from 1987 until 1998, said the billionaire entrepreneur was absolutely livid that hed lost the popular real estate trading game to a thirteen year-old girl. Mr. Trump picked up the box with all the money in it and threw it out the window, recalled Mrs. Gomez. He said, Nobody knows real estate better than me, okay? and put on his jacket and stormed out of the room.\nHowever, Trumps outburst was far from over. The self-made billionaire reportedly left his posh Manhattan residence in a fit of rage, ordering his chauffeur, Mikhail, to drive straight to a private runway at JFK International Airport where his personal Boeing 757 jet airliner sat fueled and waiting on the tarmac. Trump was whisked away to Florida where he remained in seclusion for weeks at Mar-a-Lago, his lavish $300 million Palm Beach ocean-side estate. Mr. Trump made it clear to the help that anyone caught playing Monopoly with the children would be fired on the spot and deported, said Mrs. Gomez, who was granted U.S. citizenship in 2005.\nThe startling disclosure comes mere days after the billionaire businessman announced that he will refuse to accept the results of the election in the event Hillary Clinton is voted into office. I will take a look at the time, he said when asked pointedly as to whether he would accept defeat.\nThe GOP hopeful has gone so far in recent months as to warn supporters of his presidential campaign that the U.S. election process is rigged. Its rigged, folks. Okay? Its rigged, Trump told an immense crowd in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday. Ive seen this kind of thing before many, many years ago when my own daughter Ivanka  a thirteen year-old girl  she beat me at a game of Monopoly, he said. And you know what, folks, she shouldnt have.

Russian president Vladimir Putin announced on Wednesday that he has declined an invitation to attend the upcoming 2017 presidential inauguration in Washington. Putin said his decision to turn down the presidential invite was due in part to baseless accusations by American intelligence officials that Russian hackers intervened in the U.S. election to ensure a Trump victory.\nFalse allegations such as these can be very hurtful, an emotional Putin told attendees of an economic forum in Moscow this week. The former KGB officer said the United States has an unfortunate history of levying claims against nations whose policies it disagrees with. Like a spoiled child, the [Obama administration] makes its petty pronouncements to the world, meanwhile refusing to open a dialogue with Russia, President Putin charged.\nPutins decision to remain in Moscow rather than attend the inaugural ceremony as a distinguished guest of President-elect Donald J. Trump comes as a major blow to the incoming American president who has expressed a willingness to sideline U.S. interests at home and abroad in favor of catering to the needs and wishes of Russia.\nOn Tuesday, President-elect Trump tapped Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson  a longtime friend and confidant of Vladimir Putin  to serve as the next Secretary of State. Having received the prestigious Order of Friendship award for his role in securing a lucrative oil partnership with Russia, Tillerson will serve as Putins man in Washington, providing a direct line of communication between the Kremlin and the Oval Office.\nBefore a relationship can be established, Mr. Trump will have to rein in his intelligence agencies, explained Sergei Mikhailov, a political analyst atThe Moscow Times. In order for a republic to function cohesively, the limbs must work together in support of the body, or in this case, the brain. Mikhailov warned that some in the Russian government have privately expressed concerns that Donald Trump could be seen as weak in terms of his inability to promote nationalism and pro-Russian values in the United States.\nHowever, as Mikhailov pointed out, its still too early in the game for the Kremlin to start weighing options for a regime change.

You are supplying the ingredients that are used to poison my streets, charged Duterte during a press conference on Tuesday. Get out of my cities or you will be killed.\nFlanked by a contingent of heavily armed police officers, the Philippine president said authorities would not differentiate between those suffering from seasonal allergies and habitual drug users. However, Duterte said that in order to avoid immediate execution at the hands of his national police force, antihistamine users and distributors alike are encouraged to register for treatment at their local community centers. In a rare moment of compassion, the president urged his fellow countrymen to sign up, saying, If you register now, you can spare your family the anguish of finding your bullet-ridden corpse rotting in the street.\nReeinald, a twenty-eight year-old lieutenant colonel with the Philippine National Police, oversees operations at a drug treatment center located about thirty miles south of Manila.

The lieutenant colonel said he had been authorized to provide the Philippine News Agency (PNA) with exclusive access to the centers cleansing rooms, three two-story windowless warehouses  each outfitted with its own state-of-the-art crematorium  where drug users will undergo rehabilitation seminars.\nBecause there are so many drug addicts in the Philippines, we are limited to three bullets per addict, said Reeinald before continuing, I tell my men, If you cannot kill them with three bullets, you will have to find another way. Fortunately for Reeinald and his officers, President Duterte is offering a hefty bounty to any law enforcement officer who personally takes the life of an individual caught in the act of buying or selling antihistamines and other drugs.

The Chinese government announced Sunday that it will provide funding to Planned Parenthood, a womens health organization which the U.S. House of Representatives voted last week to defund. Li Bin, who heads Chinas National Health and Family Planning Commission, said China will contribute $528 million to Planned Parenthood for the 2016 fiscal year in exchange for the continued donation of tissue samples which China plans to apply towards stem cell research.\nChina is committed to working towards a better future, not just for the Chinese people but for all people around the world, Li said. It is for this reason we have entered into a partnership with Planned Parenthood. It is not Chinas intention to meddle in Americas political affairs, but nonetheless a womans right to medical treatment should not be jeopardized by the ever-changing political climate.\nIn accordance with the agreement, Planned Parenthood will ship fetal tissue samples to several Chinese biomedical research and testing facilities on a monthly basis. Chinese scientists will then use the fetal tissue for a variety of medical related experiments including stem cell research and cloning. China is committed to the advancement of human life through medical research, Li said.\nThe Chinese government provides abortion services to women upon request except for the purpose of sex-selection, a method by which an expectant mother terminates the fetus based on the predicted sex of the child. China has historically used abortion as a means for population control and although the government doesnt make public the exact number of abortions conducted annually, in 2008 it was estimated that the government performed approximately 13 million abortions. By comparison, there were an estimated 1.2 million abortions in the United States in 2008, amounting to roughly 2% of the female population.\nPlanned Parenthood came under fire recently amid allegations that the non-profit organization had been profiting off of the sale of fetal body parts. As a result, lawmakers introduced the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015, which passed the House last week but conservative lawmakers are skeptical as to whether it will successfully pass a Senate vote. Republican congressmen may decide to attach a Planned Parenthood defunding measure to an upcoming federal budget bill which could jeopardize the federal governments ability to remain operational.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "China announced Sunday that it will help fund Planned Parenthood in exchange for tissue donations."}

According to a new report scheduled for public release this weekby the Government Accountability Office, President Obamas bathroom breaks may have cost U.S. taxpayers just over $4 billion in 2015. Data provided to the GAO by the Obama administration shows that on average, President Barack Obama took 3.5 bathroom breaks a day last year, with each trip to the toilet lasting four minutes or less.\nBy the GAOs estimate, the commander-in-chief spent just over eighty-five hours in the bathroom in 2015 alone. The question on everyones mind when they look at a report like this is, What exactly is he doing in there?' Wondered Republican senator John McCain. The former POW admitted toC-SPAN that he goes to the bathroom about once a day on a good day.\nEven so, the Arizona senator cited a particularly disturbing quote from the report stating that on October 23rd, the day former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was scheduled to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, President Obama took a record-breaking twenty-one minute bathroom break. I think its very telling, Senator McCain said.\nThe average adult male uses the restroom anywhere from three times a day to once every three days, said Dr. Deepak Gupta, a senior scatologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. Ideally we see about one ounce of stool per every twelve pounds of body weight, Dr. Gupta explained, continuing, With that said, President Obama -who weighs about one hundred eighty pounds, should produce about fifteen ounces of solid fecal matter per bowel movement.\nHowever, Dr. Gupta pointed out that due to unusually high levels of stress associated with the job of running the country, President Obama likely produces well below average stools. In all probability, the guy is a stool softener addict, Dr. Gupta toldReal News Right Now.\nDespite President Obamas low performance rating in the bathroom, the GAO estimates he still uses an above-average amount of toilet paper and -if hes a courtesy flusher, as White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest once hinted, he uses at least twice as much water per visit to the mens room as the average American. This, coupled with the obvious breaks in productivity, has cost taxpayers a whopping $4.1 billion.\nThis is simply unacceptable, Florida senator and GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio told Real News Right Now.

President Obama, speaking to reporters during a press briefing last month, called on Russian President Putin to immediately cease all cross-border activities and withdraw Russian forces from the region.\nRussias actions, President Obama said, are a clear violation of international law and Ukraines sovereignty.

The commander of the strike group, Rear Admiral Helena Cain, said in a statement yesterday that drones may be used to destroy ground based missile systems that could threaten the safety of U.S. and NATO aircraft.\nNATO, whos primary role will be the enforcement of the no-fly zone, plans to deploy fighter jets from its base in Lithuania and will provide constant air cover over the 151 mile border between Russia and Ukraine, with the no-fly zone extending fifteen miles into both countries. The purpose of the no-fly zone is to act as a deterrent against continuing Russian offensive operations into Ukraine and to help facilitate a peaceful end to this conflict, said NATO Secretary General Abernathy, who added, However our pilots have been authorized to shoot down any unauthorized aircraft that refuse to vacate the restricted airspace.\nDuring a meeting with House Democrats Tuesday night, President Obama spoke briefly on the operation, calling it a humanitarian mission while adding that presently we have no plans to put American soldiers on the ground. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who strongly opposes the no-fly zone, called it an act of war and said he is working with Russian officials to impose economic sanctions on countries in the region who are providing support to the U.S. and NATO. In a show of solidarity with Russia, Iran has formerly requested an emergency meeting with the U.N.

We have a lot of candidates who have a lot to say. But what we need is a strong candidate who can act. Priebus said Republican candidates will be flown to an undisclosed location in the Venezuelan jungle on board a Boeing C-17 transport aircraft. Once on the ground, each candidate will be given a backpack containing basic survival gear, a combat knife, and twenty-four hours to immerse themselves in the dense jungle.\nCandidates will be outfitted with a heart-rate monitor and GPS transponder, allowing us to keep track of their location and status at all times, Priebus said. In addition, The Fox News Channel will broadcast the entire deathmatch, commercial free, on live television. Anchors Bill OReilly and Ainsley Earhardt will narrate the event, with Geraldo Rivera providing guest commentary.\nAccording to Priebus, following the end of the twenty-four hour immersion period, candidates will begin hunting one another using their combat knives to perform the first kill. This is what were calling the Initiation Phase, Priebus said. After that things get abit easier and a lot more exciting.\nOnce a Republican candidate performs his first kill, he or she will receive a rewards package airdropped to their location by an unmanned drone. Each package is selected at random before it is deployed and contains a single item provided by one of nineteen American defense contractors, such as Lockheed Martin and Smith & Wesson, who are sponsoring the deathmatch. Candidates will use a variety of tools from tactical rifles to shoulder-fired rocket launchers to prove their worth to American voters, Priebus said.\nI think its a great idea, Hillary Clinton told supporters during a campaign event in Detroit today. The Democratic presidential hopeful said shes rooting for Rick Perry after having watched the way he handled a weapon along the Texas-Mexico border.\nThe RNCs deathmatch will be held two weeks before the Republican National Convention, which is scheduled for the week of July 18th at the the Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Ohio, and will be broadcast live in twenty-six nations including the United States.", "section": "Politics", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Reince Priebus, Chairman of the Republican National Committee, announced today that the RNC will host a deathmatch in the jungles of Venezuela in 2016."}

President Barack Obama, in an address to the nation today, announced that the United States will take a new stance regarding the Islamic State and U.S. foreign policy in Europe and the Middle East. As weve seen time and time again, the use of conventional methods in combating the Islamic State have yielded little progress, the president said.\nUsing unofficial back-channels, the Obama administration and the CIA have, in recent weeks, engaged in talks with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Im pleased to announce the United States has entered into a historic agreement with Islamic State that will prevent any future attacks within our country, President Obama said.\nBeginning December 24th, in commemoration of the birth of Prophet Muhammad, our armed forces, acting on my command, will assist the Islamic State in spreading the Caliphate throughout the Middle East and western Europe, President Obama said. Ive ordered Congress to reinstate the draft and have asked our European allies to embrace the Islamic Caliphate or face a massive American-led air and ground campaign.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Congress had authorized the reinstatement of the draft in secret last week. Effective December 1st, the Selective Service System will initiate a draft via online services to mobilize approximately eight million military-aged men and women from across the United States, thus creating the largest standing army on earth, Senator McConnell told C-SPAN.\nPentagon spokesperson Admiral David C. Weathers announced during a press conference in Washington, that if selected, draftees will have seventy-two hours to report for duty at their nearest military facility. If you attempt to dodge the draft, Admiral Weathers warned, you will be designated an enemy combatant and forfeit your rights as a citizen of this country and those entitled to you under the Geneva Conventions.\nOn the domestic front, President Obama has authorized Congress to reallocate funds meant for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the newly created Islamic Assimilation Agency (IAA) which will oversee the construction and operation of 1,305 state-of-the-art mosques throughout the United States. Weve elected to open a minimum of three per congressional district, the president said.\nIn addition, the House Committee on Ways and Means, the federal governments chief tax-writing committee, will institute a new 7% tax on goods and services beginning January 1, 2016. The TFAT, or Terror-Free America Tax, will give Americans the safety and security they deserve by providing economic aid and military support to the Islamic Caliphate.\nThe new changes in U.S. foreign policy come amid increasing attacks by the Islamic State in Europe, Asia, and North Africa.

Not just for the good people of North Dakota but for all Americans.\nAccompanied by a contingent of Humvees and heavily armored M1 Abrams battle tanks from the 1st Cavalry Division, Captain Dunlop arrived at the Standing Rock tribal headquarters in Fort Yates late Tuesday night. During an elaborate welcoming ceremony, the Armys Special Envoy presented tribal leaders with a peace-offering in the form of six ornate oak chests filled to the brim with precious stones. Trinkets of this type are of great significance to the natives, Captain Dunlop told the Fargo-basedValley News Live,later adding that in turn, he was bestowed with a rudimentary coat made from the skin of a buffalo.\nIn addition to Dunlops peace-offering, soldiers from the 1st Cavalry Division made an attempt to assimilate the indigenous population with modern technology by distributing nearly one thousand iPads to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe. As Americans, I believe we have an obligation to assist in the advancement of primitive civilizations no matter how small the contribution, explained Specialist Geoffrey Davis. Who knows? mused the twenty-four year-old solider as he looked on from the turret of his Humvee while a pair of natives tossed an iPad back and forth. Perhaps in two or three hundred years theyll have the means to live as we do.\nGovernor Dalrymple expressed satisfaction over the Standing Rock leaderships decision to immediately halt their longstanding protests over the much-needed Dakota Access Pipeline. Were very happy the tribes elders had the good sense to accept our gratuity, Dalrymple told CNNs Wolf Blitzer, adding that the alternative would have been costly for both parties. There was a legitimate fear that we might have another Wounded Knee on our hands, the governor later said.\nAs of Wednesday, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was on hand to assist in efforts to remove demonstrators from the main encampment after Governor Dalrymple issued an unrelated evacuation orderciting increasingly harsh weather conditions that have the potential to endanger human life.

Following an incident that occurred in November of 2015, NSA has reviewed and updated its security protocols, the agency said in a statement posted on its website.\nThe incident in question occurred just weeks before Thanksgiving on November 7, 2015, when an apparent computer glitch resulted in a sequence of highly classified nuclear launch codes, known as Gold Codes, to become embedded on the front page of the NSAs official website. According to the NSA, the codes, which are provided to the president for the purpose of authorizing a nuclear attack, were only exposed for a period of seven minutes.\nHowever, according to a high-ranking NORAD official with knowledge of the incident, hackers were still able to access the codes despite their short appearance online. Within minutes of discovering the classified data, the official told The Washington Post,a launch sequence was remotely established at a hardened missile silo located at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. Moments later, a rouge LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile left its silo.\nArmed with aW87thermonuclear warhead, the ballistic missile passed over Nevada and California before plunging into the Pacific Ocean nearly two hundred miles off the coast of Southern California, where it detonated underwater.

Less than forty-eight hours after Hillary Clinton nearly collapsed while attempting to leave a ceremony in New York honoring the victims of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, the Democratic presidential nominees personal physician revealed that Mrs. Clinton has been found to have extremely high levels of a chemical known as dihydrogen monoxide in her system.\nPrior to [Clintons] pneumonia diagnosis, we ran a series of tests to determine her overall health, Dr. Raymond Davis, Clintons primary care provider, said during an appearance onGood Morning America on Tuesday. What weve learned from those tests is that Mrs. Clintons body weight is currently made up of nearly 68% dihydrogen monoxide. The startling revelation comes at a time when Clinton has once again found herself in the spotlight for failing to disclose important details surrounding her health.\nLike the toxic chemical ricin, dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO) occurs naturally and can be found in a number of industrial products including pesticides, solvents, and Styrofoam. This is something that can have extremely adverse effects on the human body, Dr. Davis explained. When handled improperly, dihydrogen monoxide has the ability to inflict severe burns. Further, a study conducted by the World Health Organization shows an estimated 370,000 people are killed annually as a result of dihydrogen monoxide inhalation.\nThe question now is how on earth Secretary Clinton was able to ingest this much DHMO in the first place, questioned Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel. The obvious answer is this is yet another example of a complete and total lack of transparency on part of the Clinton campaign, Siegel continued. And to pull a stunt of this magnitude on the anniversary of 9/11; I cant think of a bigger insult to the American people.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Raymond Davis told Good Morning America that his office was specifically asked by Clintons campaign manager not to leak the DHMO report to the media. It was my decision to circumvent the Hippocratic Oath on this one, Dr. Davis said, adding, The public deserves to know the truth.\nThis isnt the first time dihydrogen monoxide has made headlines. In 2007, the Australian parliament made an unsuccessful attempt to ban international use of the chemical after DHMO was revealed to be a major contributor to the greenhouse effect. More recently, in August of 2016, Washington, D.C.s Department of Public Works noted in a quarterly report that dangerously high levels of dihydrogen monoxide are present in the Districts water supply.", "section": "Politics", "content_type": "article", "desc": "NEW YORK, Ny. - Less than forty-eight hours after Hillary Clinton nearly collapsed while attempting to leave a ceremony in New York honoring the victims..."}

On each occasion, it took several members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard to help calm the Pope down before the exact cause of his distress could be determined.\nIt would appear the Holy See is experiencing some nightmares that are quite vivid in nature, Father Federico Lombardi, the Vaticans official spokesperson, toldCorriere della Sera.The precise nature of the nightmares remains unclear, however Father Lombardi revealed a single factor that has remained constant throughout the dreams: the presence of American politician and GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz.\nFather Lombardi said the Pope indicated that in each of his dreams Mr. Cruz was in the White House and, in all likelihood, was the president of the United States. Additionally, Father Lombardi said the Pope described the earth in its entirety as being covered in a thick crust of solidified ash, as though it had been scorched in a violent conflagration.\nLittle else is known about the Popes seemingly ominous dreams but Father Lombardi said Vatican physicians are looking into the possibility that they might be the result of a change in the Popes diet or, perhaps, a vitamin deficiency.\nLast week Pope Francis was nominated along with American entrepreneur Donald Trump and Nadia Murad, a former ISIS captive and sex slave, to receive the 2016 Nobel Peace Prize.

The Bolivian military used an incendiary munition known as white phosphorousto incinerate approximately three hundred acres of rainforest along the South American countrys northeastern region last week, the Minister of National Defense announced on Friday. The area has been completely razed and we are confident all life has been extinguished, said Bolivian Defense Minister Ruben Saavadra Soto.\nThe controlled blaze was part of a concentrated effort by the Armed Forces of Bolivia to eradicate a rare species of spider that officials say is responsible for more than six hundred deaths over the last four months, with eighty-three occurring in November alone. Known as theacecho or stalking  spider, the astoundingly elusive arachnid can grow to about the size of a small dog. With fangs sharp enough to pierce body armor, the acechois capable of killing a full-grown adult within seconds of inflicting its venomous bite.\nBolivian officials blame increasingly warmer climates for the sharp rise in acechospider attacks. This species is most prevalent in areas known for moderate to frequent volcanic activity, said Jack Robinson, an Australian-born rainforest biologist and canopy researcher. Robinson and his team were hired by the Bolivian Ministry of National Defense to investigate the dangerous arachnids after seventeen Bolivian soldiers were found dead in their bunks  all having sustained puncture wounds to their upper body and torso region. Despite their size, these are highly versatile creatures, explained Robinson. I have personally observed an acechospider traverse the forest floor at speeds up to forty-eight kilometers per hour.\nIn October, Bolivias state-funded newspaperCambio reported that the countrys armed forces were trying unsuccessfully to squash out the spider population before it could spread to more heavily populated cities and towns. This is our biggest fear, Defense Minister Soto was quoted as saying.

President Obama will issue an executive order next week stripping Texas of statehood while creating a sovereign nation-state between the U.S. and Mexico, a White House official speaking on condition of anonymity told The Washington Post today. Effective July 1st, the laws governing the United States, including the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and, additionally, the Geneva Conventions, will no longer apply to Texas or its residents.\nThe order is set to become law just days ahead of what the Obama administration and the Pentagon are calling a large-scale training exercise. Dubbed Jade Helm 15, the operation involves several states, including Texas, and consists of roughly 1,200 soldiers and seamen from U.S. Army Special Operations Command, Navy SEALs, and Air Force special operations forces.\nIn April, Texas Governor Greg Abbott placed the Texas State Guard on alert and instructed them to closely monitor the military exercise over concerns it might be a ploy to confiscate guns from law-abiding citizens through the implementation of martial law. However, the Obama administration has repeatedly refuted these claims, calling them conspiratory and baseless.\nEric Masterson, a White House National Security advisor, said, The purpose of Operation Jade Helm is to help the Texas transitional government facilitate a swift conversion into sovereignty. This isnt some vast conspiracy; in fact, its very similar to what weve done in Iraq and Afghanistan. Masterson said the overall objective is to curb illegal immigration by creating a buffer zone between the U.S. and Mexico, effectively shortening the border between the two countries. The Texas-Mexico border currently accounts for 66% of the entire U.S.-Mexico border, with Texas serving as a focal point for illegal immigration, Masterson said.\nBeginning July 1st, the Lone Star nation-state will be solely responsible for its survival and prosperity, however the United States will maintain a fleet of U.S. Navy destroyers and nuclear submarines in the Port of Houston. Additionally, the Department of State plans to erect a heavily fortified embassy there, allowing the Port of Houston and all its assets to remain on U.S. soil.\nOf course any Texans who wish to obtain U.S. citizenship are encouraged to do, provided they seek it through legal means, said Masterson, who added that current immigration policies apply to Texan nationals the same as they do for everyone else.", "section": "Politics", "content_type": "article", "desc": "President Obama will issue an executive order next week stripping Texas of statehood while creating a sovereign nation-state between the U.S. and Mexico."}

Amid mounting international pressure and cries for justice from animal rights groups, a panel of judges at the International Court of Justice at the Hague have ordered the destruction of an icebergthe size of Rhode Island on the grounds that it was responsible for the deaths of nearly one hundred and fifty-thousand penguins.\nDubbed BO98, the 1,120 square-mile iceberg allegedly dislodged itself from the coast of Antarctica nearly six years ago and, in doing so, separated the Adelie penguins from their natural habitat and severed their food supply. This, according to a criminal complaint filed by the rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), directly contributed to the penguins starvation and eventual death.\nThis inexcusable act of genocide mustnt go unpunished, declared Mariah Chapman, an attorney representing PETA, while speaking before the International Court on Friday. PETA acknowledged that humans were likely to blame for creating the conditions which led to the iceberg becoming unhinged but said pinpointing exactly who was responsible and exacting punishment against them would be unrealistic and time-consuming.\nRather, PETA argued, the iceberg itself should be sentenced under the same guidelines as its human counterparts who have been convicted of genocide and other crimes against humanity. Deliberate and systematic acts of murder are just as prevalent in the animal kingdom as they are in the human realm, stated Ms. Chapman, but added, However, for obvious reasons, animals are often unable to report these heinous acts.\nThe presiding judges, it seems, were inclined to agree with PETA. On Monday, the ICC found the iceberg known as BO98 guilty of genocide and other atrocities stemming from its dislocation from the arctic mainland and subsequently ordered its immediate destruction by NATO forces.\nThe United States, a founding member of NATO, has taken it upon itself to carry out the icebergs execution and announced Monday afternoon that it has deployed theUSS Momsen, a guided-missile destroyer, to the Southern Ocean. The vessels commander, Rear Admiral Martin Giancola told the Associated Pressthat the U.S. will use a combination of cruise missiles and high-explosive depth charges to destroy the iceberg. Justice will be served swiftly and without hesitation, the rear admiral promised.\nIn the meantime, PETA has called for a global moment of silence on Tuesday, March 1st, at twelve-noon (Rothera Research Station Time) in honor of the one hundred and fifty-thousand penguins who perished off the coast of Antarctica.

The clearly disheveled Hair Club for Men president appears to beg for mercy as another lawless miscreant forcibly grabs him from behind while unsheathing from his belt what authorities believe is anAndis Ceramic BGR+cordless hair clipper.\nSperlings vain attempts to save himself come to a horrific end as two rather heavyset goons restrain him while the groups ruthless leader uses the Andis Ceramic BGR+ to methodically shear Sperlings full-bodied auburn hair from is scalp. Amid bursts of celebratory gunfire, the chief henchman, in an apparent show of victory, thrusts a handful of Sperlings robust hair into the camera for all to see.\nAs of Wednesday, the fate of the Hair Club for Men remains uncertain but authorities say evidence gathered at the scene in downtown Boca Raton seems to suggest that Sy Sperling is no longer the companys acting president or, for that matter, a client.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Sy Sperling, the president and client of the Hair Club for Men was deposed by a group of heavily armed hooligans believed to be affiliated with Rogaine."}

Pope Francis kicked off the start of a three-nation trip across South America today with his first mass, with over a million Ecuadorians in attendance, in the coastal city of Guayaquil. Delivering the mass in Spanish, the Pope spoke about the importance of family in modern society, saying, It needs to be helped and strengthened, lest we lose our proper sense of the services which society as a whole provides.\nDuring his sermon, Pope Francis announced to Christians around the world that God had called upon him, instructing him to revise the most sacred of texts, the Ten Commandments. Given to the Israelites by God himself at Mount Sinai, the Commandments include instructions for worship and list several prohibited practices.\nPope Francis said Christians around the world are faced with ever-increasing temptations brought on by the evils of modern society. The Pope said the updated Commandments reflect the changing times and include some minor rewording of the existing rules as well as the addition of two new Commandments.\nThe Fourth Commandment, which advocates that proper respect be shown towards ones parents, has been reworded in order to include children raised by same-sex parents. Pope Francis said the Seventh Commandment, prohibiting adultery and, among other things, homosexuality, has been removed entirely, as instructed by God, in order to extend Gods grace to all His children.\nAddressing the inclusion of the new Commandments, which bring the total number to eleven, Pope Francis praised the rapid growth of technology in the digital age but said progress comes at a price. The new Fifth Commandment, which replaces the prohibition of adultery, forbids all aspects of genetic engineering and bans the consumption of genetically modified foods.\nLastly, the Eleventh Commandment disallows personal idolization and the glorification of ones self over God. Using the Kardashians, a highly publicized celebrity family, as an example, Pope Francis said, Selfies are an abomination in the eyes of our Lord.\nA spokesman for the Vatican, Father Federico Lombardi, said the Eleven Commandments are currently being etched into marble by an Italian sculptor and, upon completion, will be unveiled to the world in Saint Peters Square following an internationally televised mass.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Pope Francis announced to Christians around the world that God had instructed him to \"rewrite the Ten Commandments.\""}

According to the World Health Organization, a colony consisting of more than one billion Africanized cicadas is terrorizing the worlds second largest continent.\nThere are currently more than thirteen hundred different types of cicadas on earth with many species existing since at least 1558 B.C. However, according to leading entomologists working in Africa and parts of Australia, a new breed of cicadas, commonly referred to as the Africanized Cicadidae, pose a significant and imminent threat to the worlds ecosystems.\nLast month the South Sudanese government reported that a swarm of nearly four million Africanized Cicadas brought down two commercial airliners shortly after they took off from Juba Airport. Unlike other more well-known species of cicada, the Africanized species has a hardened exoskeleton that serves as a permanent suit of armor, protecting it from extreme weather and predators. According to theSouth Sudan News Agency, a dense cloud of insects flew into the jets engines causing them to explode mid-flight. In all, seven hundred and thirty-six passengers and crew perished.\nThis is not something to be taken lightly, said Dr. Jens Larsen. These are essentially fifty caliber bullets with wings. Dr. Larsen, who heads the World Health Organizations Incident Response Team, said Africanized Cicadas can travel at speeds of up to eighty-five kilometers an hour and have been known to penetrate car windshields and windows with surprising ease.\nEntire villages have been wiped out by this species of cicada, Dr. Larsen said, adding that officials initially believed many victims had been executed by anti-government forces but subsequent autopsies revealed that the Africanized insects had quite literally dive-bombed their targets, killing many of them instantly. Due to their unusually hardened exterior, this species is very capable of punching through a persons chest cavity or skull with alarming force.\nAccording to the WHO, the Africanized Cicada has killed more than 21,800 people in Sub Saharan Africa since 2015. Now, officials say, the killer insects are migrating west towards Central America. Probably the most surprising aspect about the Africanized Cicada is its unique ability to mate and reproduce mid-flight, Dr. Larsen said. This presents a serious problem in that their numbers have the potential to triple or even quadruple by the time they reach the Central American mainland.\nTo make matters worse, Africanized Cicadas have proven to be highly resilient and are immune to most pesticides and other forms of repellent. According to what weve seen, and what weve been told by the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army, direct exposure to fire is the only viable method for killing these things, Dr. Larsen explained.\nThe World Health Organization on Sunday issued a regional alert for Central America and parts of the eastern United States advising government and public health officials to make preparations for a worst-case scenario. The WHO estimates that more than four billion Africanized Cicadas are expected to descend on the continental United States as early as June of this year.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "According to the WHO, a colony consisting of more than one billion Africanized cicadas is terrorizing the world's second largest continent."}

Recently suspended NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams is being hailed a hero for actions he took during an apartment fire last Thursday in which 22 people were injured and at least 2 are still missing. The seven-alarm fire occurred on Second Avenue and was the result of an explosion. The aftermath left three buildings destroyed and a fourth severely damaged.\nManhattan resident Keith Ramsay, who witnessed the fire, told ABC News he spotted Brian Williams on the sidewalk across the street from the blaze. He was wearing a reddish-brown track suit and, I think, drinking a latte, Ramsay recalled. Moments later, Williams personally recounted to ABC News, I heard screams coming from inside the building and was overcome with a sense of urgency to act. Drawing on my experience as a volunteer firefighter, I rushed toward the inferno. I was able to use a metal trashcan lid to break a window before hurling myself into the building. I distinctly remember the hotness of the air as dense smoke engulfed me. Several minutes passed before Williams emerged from the blaze, covered in a thick layer of ash and carrying three young children in his arms.\nThis reporter spoke with Brian Williams in a phone interview Saturday night, in which the suspended news anchor recalled what he saw inside the towering inferno. As I was going room to room, trying to locate these terrified children, I was seeing things of a suspicious nature. Things like rubber tubing, broken glass beakers, and empty packages of cold medicine littered the floor. Speaking as a veteran journalist, it was clear to me that this fire was the direct result of a meth lab explosion.\nThe New York City Fire Department has not confirmed or denied Williams allegations that the fire was linked to an existing methamphetamine lab in 121 Second Avenue. Instead investigators are looking at a blast of gas which erupted from a corrupt gas line somewhere in the building as the cause of the seven-alarm fire.\nSpeaking with George Stephanopoulos this morning on ABCs This Week, Brian Williams detailed the events leading up to the harrowing rescue. We were flying low over the city, coming up from the south above Second Ave in a U.S. Navy Black Hawk helicopter. I was embedded with six members of SEAL Team Four and we were en route to 121 Second Avenue, where intelligence assets on the ground had identified an ISIS bomb making operation.\nBy the time the helicopter reached 121 Second Avenue, the building was already in flames. The chopper hovered over the rooftop  I remember feeling the cold New York air on my face as the Black Hawks side doors rolled open -allowing just enough time for members of SEAL Team Four and myself to rappel onto the roof. Williams, who appeared on This Week wearing a bulletproof PRESS vest and a Kevlar helmet with a mounted GoPro camera, told Stephanopoulos the SEAL team used a satchel charge to blow a hole in the buildings roof before dropping down into the fifth floor.\nWe went floor by floor in search of the elusive ISIS bomb makers, all the while battling extreme heat and choking smoke. At one point we lost a member of the SEAL team whos name I cant reveal due to matters of national security- we lost him when the staircase he was standing on became engulfed in flames and collapsed. In the heat of the moment, my adrenaline pumping, I leapt towards the collapsed staircase, retrieving the fallen soldiers M4 assault rifle and pressed forward with the SEAL team.\nIn the end, Williams said no ISIS members were located in the raid. However, he credited himself with the successful rescue of six children from the blaze.

An Amber Alert was called off Friday afternoon after police arrested a child predator who led them on a fifty mile high-speed chase that spanned two states and left eleven people, including four police officers, dead.\nIt all began Friday morning when Carla Menendez, a third grade teacher at New Castle Elementary School, noticed her student, eight-year old Kyle Jefferson, was absent from class. School officials contacted Kyles parents, Tom and Eileen Jefferson, who said the last theyd seen or heard from their son had been when he boarded a county school bus just an hour before. It was then that school officials notified the New Castle Country Police Department, who issued an Amber Alert for Kyle Jefferson.\nAt approximately 10:05 a.m. New Castle police received a call from a concerned citizen who spotted the young Kyle Jefferson near The Home Depot on Sunset Boulevard. Officers were en route to The Home Depot when a dispatcher notified them that the silent alarm had been triggered nearby at the Citizens Bank on North Dupont Highway.\nPolice arrived on the scene to find mild-manneredKyle Jefferson exiting Citizens Bank, with his backpack -whichappeared to be stuffed with cash-around his shoulders, while brandishing a Uzi submachine gun. Before police could intervene, Kyle, who came in Second Place in his schools science fair this year, opened fire on the officers vehicles. In the ensuing chaos, young Kyle Jefferson was able to hijack a New Castle Police cruiser and flee the scene.\nMoments later additional units were in pursuit of the stolen police car as it traveled south on Dupont Highway while weaving in and out of traffic. Miraculously, the unassuming eight-year-old was able to shoot out the tires of the lead police car, causing it to veer off the road into a Sunocogas station where it struck a fuel line and exploded. The resulting fire destroyed five nearby businesses, including the Sunoco, and left seven people dead.\nShortly after passing the Maryland-Delaware state line, the youthful Kyle Jeffersons commandeered police car encountered a roadblock set up by Maryland State Troopers. Upon hitting a spike strip at one hundred miles per hour, Kyles front tires were torn apart causing the vehicle to flip over roughly nine times before coming to a rest on the median. Officers rushed the vehicle, taking the child, who was remarkably unharmed, into custody. Kyle Jefferson, who officers described as extremely polite, was found to have a fully automatic Uzi submachine gun, $2,500 in cash, and a two-pound bag of lollipops in his possession.\nHes just never done anything like this before in his life, said Eileen Jefferson, Kyles mother, who, like many others in New Castle County, spoke very highly of her son. Mrs. Jefferson believes Kyle may have become overly excited after playing the video game Grand Theft Auto V at a friends house earlier in the week.

However, the details of these sessions were never recorded. In an email response to questions submitted by this reporter, Facebooks Public Relations director April O. Neel confirmed that Mr. Zuckerberg attends biweekly sessions at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade strictly as a pro bono consultant.\nIf true, these allegations could explain why in March of last year, Facebook requisitioned a secure, climate controlled, server storage facility roughly the size of two football fields at the Utah Data Center, a massive data mining complex operated by the National Security Agency.\nGeneral Turgidson, who agreed to meet with this reporter at an undisclosed location yesterday, defended the PRISM program as well as Facebooks alleged involvement, citing national security concerns amid an ever growing age of technology. He called the clear invasion of privacy necessary and added, Its no secret that Facebook openly employs the use of surveillance technology, whether it be global positioning services or facial recognition software. The public is aware of it and they accept it. Its right there in the Terms of Service.\nOvershadowed by these groundbreaking allegations against Zuckerberg is the mysterious disappearance of Facebook intern James Olsen. Olsen, who accepted a post-college internship with the social media company late last year, posted a cell phone video he took during a staff meeting at Facebook headquarters in which Zuckerberg can be heard allegedly shouting, Privacy is not a right, its a privilege! The video was uploaded to the media sharing site YouTube on January 5th, 2015, however it was pulled by the site less than four hours later.\nA programmer currently working for Facebook, who spoke to this reporter on the condition of anonymity, said he witnessed plain clothes security officers armed with handguns forcibly remove Olsen from Facebook headquarters. The programmer claims Olsen was escorted to a waiting SUV bearing official U.S. government plates before being driven away. Olsens parents have since filed a missing persons report with the Menlo Park Police Department.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Facebook is vehemently denying allegations that founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been employed with the U.S. National Security Agency for years."}

However, in an effort to reduce the likelihood that news of the renewed investigation might play a role in influencing the presidential election, Director Comey has agreed to wait until Wednesday, November 9, to update congress on the FBIs findings.\nWith the election less than ten days away, Democrats and moderate Republicans are lashing out at the FBI directors handling of the new information surrounding Clintons private email server.

Residents of Hillsville, a small town in Carroll County, Virginia with a population just shy of 2,700, assembled in the gymnasium at Carroll County Middle School on Sunday to hear a presentation prepared by Army National Guard Brigadier General Franklin P.

The brigadier general has been appointed by the White House to head a new initiative enacted under a recent executive order by President Obama authorizing the federal government to sequester nearly 300 million firearms from private citizens across the United States.\nIts about winning hearts and minds, Brigadier General Marshal told the audience at Carroll County Middle School. In exchange for their compliance, the Obama administration is offering Americans who willingly turn over their weapons a sizable tax credit. Any American over the age of twenty-one who, by their own accord, turns in five or more firearms, will be exempt from paying federal income taxes in 2017, Brigadier General Marshal said.\nHowever, the brigadier general stressed that the incentive only applies to Americans who willingly forfeit their right to bear arms. Any individual -American or otherwise, who exercises deceit or tries in any way, shape, or form to circumvent these laws, will be met with the full force of the United States military, President Obama warned in a pre-recorded statement to the nation this week.\nIn accordance with the executive order which President Obama issued to combat rising gun violence in the United States, the White House has ordered a temporary suspension of thePosse Comitatus Act. Passed in 1873 by President Rutherford B. Hayes, the act limits the federal governments ability to use the military to enforce domestic policies.\nDuring times of national crisis, it becomes necessary to trade certain liberties for the benefit of added security, Robert Churchill, an attorney who specializes in constitutional law, told CNNs Wolf Blitzer Sunday.

Its silly, protested Buck Weatherford, a fifty-seven year-old Hillsville native. Guns in general are just barbaric. Anything youd need to do with a firearm can just as easily be accomplished using a simple bow and arrow. Buck, who makes a living designing custom crossbows for hunting and home defense, said he turned over three firearms, including an Uzi submachine gun, to the Virginia National Guard. It was the right thing to do, he said.\nWhile the vast majority of confiscated firearms will be melted down under federal supervision, a small portion are to be used to arm various factions of moderate rebels fighting Assads forces in Syria.

A spokesperson for the Manitowoc District Attorneys Office announced on Tuesday that state prosecutors will appear in federal court this week to file first degree murder charges against Manitowoc resident Steven Avery. In light of new evidence, we believe Mr. Avery played a senior role in the shooting death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1968, said Ryan Peters, a spokesperson for the DAs office.\nProsecutors allege that Mr. Avery, who is already serving a life sentence at the Waupun Correctional Institution in southeastern Wisconsin for first degree murder, traveled to Memphis, Tennessee -even staying in the Lorraine Motel on two occasions, in the days and weeks leading up to the assassination of late civil rights leader. Mr. Avery played a key role in the planning and execution of this brazen act and its high time that justice is served, Mr. Peters said.\nAt the request of state prosecutors, Manitowoc County sheriffs deputies traveled to Tennessee on official orders last month where they recovered a plethora of DNA belonging to Steven Avery. Mr. Peters said investigators were primarily focused on room 306 of the Lorraine Motel where Dr. King was staying the day he was shot and killed. Investigators say the motel, which was converted into the National Civil Rights Museum in 2014, was awash with traces of Mr. Avery. Its like he was just there yesterday, Mr. Peters commented. The DNA, which is said to include skin and hair follicles, has since been turned over to the FBI and is undergoing testing at a forensics lab in Quantico, Virginia.\nIn addition, investigators have reexamined evidence obtained by the FBI in the days following Dr. Kings assassination. Included in the treasure trove of evidence are a set of binoculars and the .30-06 Winchester rifle that was used in the shooting. Following an intensive forensics analysis, Mr. Averys fingerprints were found not just on the trigger, but all over the weapon, said Mr. Peters, who added that Mr. Avery likely obtained the rifle through legal means.\nA representative for the Avery family told WBAY Action 2 News -a Wisconsin ABC affiliate, that contrary to the allegations made by Manitowoc prosecutors, Mr. Avery has never been to Tennessee. Hes never even left the state, the spokesperson said. Furthermore, Mr. Averys defense team, in a statement released Tuesday, argued that Mr. Avery couldnt have been involved in Dr. Kings assassination because at the time of the shooting he was barely six years old.\nHowever, Manitowoc County prosecutors say none of that matters. Such theories and coincidences are irrelevant to the investigation, said Peters when questioned by a reporter with the Green Bay Press Gazette. Were in the business of presenting facts and examining evidence. Thats how we solve cases.\nIf convicted, Mr. Avery could find himself facing an additional life sentence for the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The prominent civil rights leader was thirty-nine years old at the time of his death.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "\"In light of new evidence, we believe Mr. Avery played a senior role in the shooting death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1968.\""}

Instead, Carson said, he merely watched as another neighbor -a fully licensed brain surgeon, performed the life saving operation on a table in his unfinished basement.\nLater in the debate, afterWall Street Journal editor-in-chief Gerald Bakerfurtherpressed Dr. Carson on the subject, Carson, who was visibly agitated and appeared to be sweating, declaredthat the basementbrain surgery scenario never actuallyhappened at all.

These despicable individuals have  for months  deliberately manipulated the publics perception with the sole purpose of turning a profit. Special Agent Greenwald said the FBI confiscated more than a dozen printing press machines which the suspects used to mass-produce fake newspapers before peddling them on street corners to unsuspecting New Yorkers.\nDescribing the operation as highly sophisticated, authorities said the perpetrators were able to produce thousands of knock-off newspapers per week at a cost of mere pennies, meanwhile netting upwards of $1.50 a pop for the illicit tabloids. They were making a killing, explained one law enforcement official who spoke toReal News Right Now on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Among the mountains of evidence seized during the raid, the official said FBI agents recovered tens of thousands of copies of a multi-page fake news publication titledThe New York Toast, a seemingly obvious imitation of the popular and widely circulatedNew York Post.\nHowever, according to Special Agent Greenwald, the FBIs discovery of the illegal printing press operation is only the tip of the iceberg. During Tuesdays press conference, Greenwald produced what appeared to be a freshly printed copy ofThe Wall Street Journal. What youre looking at is a fake newspaper, explained Greenwald. Its not real. Indeed, the object was in fact a molded slab of plastic which, from a distance, resembled a real newspaper. Greenwald said the counterfeit item was one of nearly a quarter million fabrications that have been seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents over the past month.\nAuthorities described a disturbing hierarchy in the underground world of fake news where anonymous individuals and organizations  many of whom identify themselves by cryptic pseudonyms or aliases  compete for likes, views, and shares.

IKEA, best known for its line of furniture and home accessories, first unveiled its new product line in February at the International Defence Expedition & Conference, otherwise known as IDEX, at the Abu Dhabi Exhibition Centre in the United Arab Emirates.\nFlanked by veteran defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, representatives from IKEAs Defense Research & Analytics Group presented potential consumers with their signature line of ready-to-assemble defensive combat products. From mobile anti-aircraft systems to compact tactical carbines, IKEA displayed an uncanny ability to integrate their existing sales mantra into the defense and security industry.\nAt IKEA we have a slogan, You do a little. We do a little. And together we save a lot,' Mayda Sorenson told prospective buyers during a live-fire demonstration of the Ready-To-Assemble Personal Defense Weapon, a compact assault rifle designed for special operations forces. The RTA-PDW can be easily assembled in a high-stress situation, even by an inexperienced operator, in under eight minutes, Sorenson explained, adding that every product, including the RTA-PDW, comes packaged with user-friendly assembly instructions in twelve languages, including English, French, Arabic, and Chinese. At IKEA we believe in providing quality products at an affordable price, Sorenson said before demonstrating the RTA-PDWs burst-fire capabilities on a practice dummy.\nThis reporter spoke with Lieutenant General Khurshid Rasheed of the Iraqi Armys 9th Armoured Division. Iraqs Ministry of Defence recently purchased some fifty Ready-to-Assemble T-3 Mobile Anti-Aircraft Systems from IKEA for use in their fight against the Islamic State. At a cost of less than a third of other systems, such as the Patriot Air and Missile Defense System manufactured by American defense contractor Raytheon, the T-3 performs just as well, if not better, according to General Rasheed, who said, It took some time to understand the instructions but my men were able to assemble two of these systems in just a few hours time. The General added that during assembly, his soldiers discovered a majority of the anti-aircraft systems were missing two or three required screws, but nonetheless performed exceptionally well during live-fire exercises.\nThe RTA T-3 Mobile Anti-Aircraft System and other similar products are only available for purchase online or through IKEAs corporate office.

People die every day, the son of a slaughterhouse kill floor supervisor told News 4 San Antonio. The way I see it, my job is to turn what is otherwise a bleak and dismal situation into something beautiful.\nNow, a new Texas law requiring women to bury their aborted fetuses has the potential to double, or even triple, Fosters already booming profits. Were very excited for the future, he told News 4. This is huge for the funeral industry. So huge, in fact, that Foster and a longtime business associate recently pooledtogether nearly $1 million to launch a startup company specializing in handcrafted caskets built specifically for fetuses and fetal tissue.\nWere doing some very interesting things and really trying to move away from the traditional style caskets that most people are used to seeing, Foster explained. Right now our clients have the option of choosing from a number of very elegant casket styles. My personal favorite is our 2.75-inch cherry oak Signature casket. Affordably priced between $899 and $1,199 with the option to add a variety of upgrades, Foster said the matchbox-sized casket is an ideal choice for most fetuses aborted during the first trimester.\nFor anything beyond that first trimester, we offer a wide selection of attractive cases which youll find on display in our showroom. Foster continued, saying, These pieces range in size from a childs lunch box all the way up to the exquisite Fosters Limited Edition; this is a shoe box-sized glass sarcophagus available in both polished and stained glass. The Limited Edition casket, which Foster claims is in high demand, sells for a whopping $7,899 before additional upgrades such as plush lining or a miniature down pillow. For those wish to avoid the stress of a financial burden in their time of grieving, we offer a very convenient and flexible payment plan, he added.\nHowever, Foster says his business model is about more than just selling high-end caskets to the discerning mourner. Our clients have the option of choosing from an assortment of affordable funeral and memorial packages, he said. The Standard Service, Fosters most popular package, which is priced at $2,399, includes a wake or viewing and a traditional burial ceremony. Its like any other service you might attend, Foster admitted. However, the difference, he said, is in the presentation.

In an exclusive interview with former NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams, ex-president George W. Bush spoke at his ranch in Crawford, Texas this week about adjusting to life post-presidency and discussed a variety of topics including the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Cuba, Osama bin Laden, and his involvement in the attacks in New York and Washington on September 11th, 2001.\nYou often hear people say Bush did 9/11. Thats just not true, the 43rd president told Williams. I was only a pawn; a foot-soldier of sorts. Bush, while downplaying his role in the tragedy, said the events in their entirety were orchestrated by the Illuminati. These guys are involved in what they call a multi-century power struggle with the Reptilians, Bush said. They want to achieve world-domination.\nOn the night of September 10th, less than twelve hours before American Airlines Flight 11 struck the north tower of the World Trade Center, the Bush administration, acting on orders from the Illuminati, sent a twelve-man team into the WTC to plant thermite charges on the north and south towers steel support beams. Immediately following the conclusion of the operation, the team, according to Bush, was disposed of by FEMA.\nWhen asked by Mr. Williams if the former president thought he may be putting his life at risk by bringing such earth-shattering allegations to light, Bush replied, Absolutely, Brian. But I cannot, in good conscience, stay silent on this. Bush said hed hired a foreign private military contractor who was providing a sizable non-Jewish force to protect his ranch.\nIn response to a question by Williams as to al Qaedas involvement in 9/11, Bush said the Islamic terror group was merely a scapegoat. Calling al Qaeda a rag-tag band of extremists, Bush said the group was used to justify the War on Terror, which the Illuminati used as a means to covertly root out Reptilian operatives. As for the death of Osama bin Laden at the hands of SEAL Team Six on May 2nd, 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the former two-term president shrugged and said, Wheres the body?\nSwitching topics, Williams brought up Hurricane Katrina. As you know, I won a Peabody Award for my coverage of the situation while embedded with the National Guard on the harsh streets of New Orleans. At one point, I remember very clearly, we came under heavy machine gun fire in the French Quarter. What happened there? Williams asked.\nBush, who paused before offering a response, said, Brian, Im gonna level with you. The Reptilians were responsible for Hurricane Katrina. The ex-president hesitated before continuing, You know, its not that I dont care about black people; at the time I was trying to prevent another 9/11. Bush went on to say that had his administration provided a quicker and more efficiently managed response in the aftermath of Katrina, he would have effectively thrown the United States into war with the Reptilians. I could not put the American people in that position.\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Bush said, he has tried unsuccessfully to reach out to Edward Snowden. The former president said he believes Snowden, an ex-CIA contractor and whistle-blower, could help facilitate his safe passage to Russia where he intends to seek refuge from the Illuminati. Neither they nor the Reptilians have ever infiltrated the Kremlin, Mr. Bush said, adding, Its the safest place on earth.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "In an exclusive interview with MSNBC's Brian Williams, George W.

We have reports they are holding between two and three hundred people but we are unable to confirm their status at this time.\nBrigadier General Almoz said one of the Scientologists, whom authorities believe to be the ringleader, issued a statement via the mosques P.A. system conveying the groups intentions. They have made clear that any attempt to enter the site will be met with deadly force, Brig. Gen. Almoz said. The IDFs spokesperson went on to say that an unidentified member of the armed faction passed a handwritten message to Israeli police that described the group as a recon team for the Galactic Confederacy.\nTheyve indicated that they intend to hold the mosque indefinitely or, at least, until the arrival of their god, Xenu, who they believe is using the mosque as a gateway to earth, Brig. Gen. Almoz said.\nScientologists worship an extraterrestrial being known as Xenu, the autocratic dictator of the Galactic Confederacy who, more than 75 million years ago, brought billions of people to earth aboard a spacecraft which, according to biblical texts, is said to resemble aDouglas DC-8 commercial airliner.\nIsraeli intelligence officials believe the group may be affiliated with a secretive order within the Church of Scientology known as Sea Org. Consisting of the churchs most dedicated members, the Sea Org has been rumored in the past to be involved in paramilitary activities and may be in possession of a small naval fleet.\nA Twitter account purportedly belonging to one of the Scientologists inside the al-Aqsa mosque tweeted early Sunday morning that the almighty Xenus arrival is upon us! May his presence purify all of mankind!\nAn American intelligence official speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly comment on the situation, told Haaretzthat the United States is assisting Israel in trying to determine the names and nationalities of those involved in the siege.\nThe al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem is considered to be among the holiest sites in Islam and sits atop the Temple Mount, an important site not only for the Muslim faith, but Christianity and Judaism, as well.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "JERUSALEM, Isr. - A heavily armed faction of Scientologists -many of whom are believed to be American, have taken control of the al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem"}

The chairman of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is calling on world leaders to join a global initiative to reduce the earths population by up to six percent before 2047. Described as a realistic alternative to requiring corporations to decrease their annual emissions, the Global Reduction Pact has the potential to drastically offset the effects of climate change over the next century.\nDont worry, were not suggesting that every single country will have to meet reduction requirements by conducting mass exterminations, IPCC chairman Hoesong Lee reassured reporters on Monday. On the contrary, our recommendation that the vast majority can achieve success through compulsory sterilization. Lee said after careful deliberation, a panel of U.N. officials has determined that a lottery system is the only fair way to dictate who will be selected for sterilization. We leave it up to individual countries to determine which of their citizens are eligible for entry into the lottery, Lee said.\nA number of nations including Canada, China, and Russia, have already committed to the Global Reduction Pact. This is a time for Russians around the world to come together in support of the Motherland, Russian president Vladimir Putin said on Monday. Russia and about a dozen other countries with populations exceeding one hundred million people  including India, the United States, and Indonesia  will have to bear the brunt of the effort. Russians are no stranger to self-sacrifice and struggle, declared Putin. It is in our blood.\nMeanwhile, U.S. President-elect Donald J. Trump, who continues to deny the existence of climate change, expressed interest in the agreement, telling Fox News host Sean Hannity that forced sterilizations are an important step toward making America great again. You have people in this country who  quite frankly  should not be allowed to reproduce. I have many friends who are doctors and they all tell me that chemical castration is an excellent method for preventing this sort of thing. Trump said he is considering using a litmus-style test  rather than a lottery  to determine which Americans will be selected for sterilization.\nThe U.N. acknowledged that in order to reduce the earths population by an estimated 420 million people in time for the proposed thirty-year deadline, poorer countries that lack sufficient means to carry out compulsory sterilizations will have to seek out more archaic methods in an effort to meet their quota.

Nicknamed The Official Escort Of The Jihad, the company is already reporting huge profits in countries like Iraq, Syria, and Libya.\nSimilar to American companies like Uber and Lyft, users can gain access to the car service simply by logging into the VieBied app through their smartphones. Using GPS, the app lets users know which vehicles are available within a desired radius of their location. Payment is made upon delivery using a third-party Bitcoin service.\nWe offer our clients three pricing tiers, Bin Talal told the Washington Business Journal. Our lowest and most popular option is a compact car or sedan containing roughly five kilograms of plastic explosives in the trunk. From there, prices and vehicle size increase significantly. The third tier option is a box truck packed with five hundred kilograms of ammonium nitrate fuel oil and fertilizer, which, according to the VieBied app is enough to level a five-story apartment building.\nThis is a really impressive business model, says CNNMoney contributor Michael De Santa.

Potential investors are keeping a watchful eye on VeBied should the company eventually decide to go public.

The dire economic crisis in Greece reached its conclusion today after China announced it had used a recent debt maintenance payment from the United States to purchase the southeastern European country for 201.6 billion Euros, or $225 billion, thereby eliminating Greeces loan obligations to the European Central Bank.\nThe purchase brought some stability, albeit temporarily, to the countrys struggling economy today as banks reopened following a transfer of roughly 95 billion Euros from Beijing to the Greek banking system. This is only the beginning, said Chinas Premier Li Keqiang. In one months time we will hold elections to replace the current government in Athens. Li said a diplomatic envoy is en route to Greece to assist with the transition process and vet potential candidates.\nTop officials from Chinas Ministry of Commerce met with members of the European Union today to discuss the resolution of Greeks debt, which China hopes to resolve by August in time for the new elections. Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will remain in office, though only as an adviser to Chinese diplomatic officials, until July 30th, according to Li. However, the Hellenic Parliament is set to be dissolved in the coming weeks.\nVery little will change in the daily lives of the Greek people, Li said. It is not Chinas intention to occupy Greece by any means. We hope to maintain a relationship similar to our alliance with Hong Kong. The Premier said Greeks can expect high unemployment rates to plummet by late 2015 following the construction of several industrial chemical production facilities, which China will provide as a gift to the people of Greece, free of charge.\nThe United States condemned Chinas decision to purchase Greece, with President Obama calling the move a flagrant violation of international law.

President Barack Obama will exercise his presidential powers next week when he signs an executive order that will ban the sale and transfer of firearms to private citizens in the United States. The announcement comes less than a week after a gunman armed with a handgun and an assault rifle shot and killed forty-nine people and wounded fifty-three others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\nOnce enacted, the National Security and Individual Protection Act, otherwise known as E.O. 13717, will prohibit the sale or barter of firearms by licensed dealers and individual sellers to private citizens. Americans who have legally purchased firearms prior to the executive orders issue date will be permitted to keep them. Let me be clear, were not taking away anyones guns here, President Obama said on Friday. This is about keeping weapons out of the hands of dangerous people.\nThe president explained that under the new law, Americans who were once eligible to acquire firearms through legal means are still able to do so but must manufacture the weapons themselves. If you absolutely have to have a gun, I have no doubt youll find some way to build it yourself, Obama said, continuing, Its what the Founding Fathers did, its what the Minutemen did, and as a student of constitutional law, I believe there is little doubt that this iswhat they intended when they penned the Constitution.\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives director Thomas E. Brandon further explained the guidelines for manufacturing homemade firearms, saying, Prior to assembly, [individuals] must notify the BATF of their intent to manufacture such a firearm. Under the National Firearms Act you will be subjected to a mandatory $200 tax, applicable for each firearm you create, Brandon explained. This applies to even the most rudimentary rifles, pistols, and shotguns; anything that fires a projectile is subject to NFA guidelines.\nThis is quite an ingenious ploy by the Obama administration, remarked CNN political analyst Elliot Brewster. That theyve managed to pull this off without violating the Constitution in any way, shape, or form is an incredible accomplishment in and of itself. Brewster noted that President Obama has pointed out repeatedly throughout the course of his time in office that he has no intention of infringing upon the right of the American people to keep and bear arms. This is a true testament to his legacy.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "President Barack Obama will exercise his presidential powers next week when he signs an executive order banning the sale and transfer of firearms..."}

Officers arrived on the scene to find what they believed was a muscular African-American man standing idly behind a dumpster.

Due to the Potomacs often murky waters, Blatter said his boats frequently circle the shallow waters off the coast of Roosevelt Island where the bull sharks have been known to hang out.\nHowever, as a result of increased boat traffic on the Potomac, some tour boat operators are turning to a process known as chumming to lure sharks away from Roosevelt Island and into other shallow areas of the river. Illegal in some parts of the world because of the increased risk it poses to humans, chumming is the act of using a mixture of blood, bone, and fish parts to lure sharks into a specific area.\nWe dont typically encourage chumming because of its adverse effects on marine life, Blatter said. Now having said that, we offer a special excursion on Sundays which is geared toward more experienced swimmers. We hit the water before sunrise and head over to a little rock cluster known as the Three Sisters where it gets to be around forty feet deep. We put you in a diving cage and drop you ten or twelve feet down with about thirty gallons of chum, explainedBlatter, adding, Its a really unique experience.\nBull sharks, which can grow to nearly eight feet in length, are the only known species of shark that can survive in both fresh and saltwater.

At least twenty-six people were hospitalized last month following a brawl between Boston police and Massachusetts State Troopers outside of a Whole Foods in downtown Boston. Witnesses say at least two officers with the Boston Police Department accosted a State Trooper as he exited the Whole Foods on Cambridge Street. One officer allegedly told the trooper, Go back to f****** Framingham, you c***, before ripping the troopers groceries from his hands and hurling them into the street.\nShoppers and Whole Foods employees watched in horror as the two officers began beating and kicking the trooper, all the while screaming obscenities at him, until he collapsed on the pavement. Miraculously, the trooper was able to call for backup before losing consciousness. Massachusetts State Troopers attempted to defuse the situation but were overwhelmed when a Boston Police Special Operations Unit arrived on scene and began firing rubber bullets and tear gas in the direction of the troopers. In all, seven troopers and nineteen bystanders were treated by paramedics for non-life threatening injuries.\nOver the last decade weve witnessed the rise of a disturbing and often unreported trend in the law enforcement community, said Dr. Carl Gapinski, a former LAPD detective and criminologist. These encounters are happening all over the country but are most prevalent in departments that have received military-grade weapons and hardware from the Pentagon. Dr. Gapinski said a variety of factors contribute to the surge in police violence but available data suggests jurisdiction disputes or turf wars are the primary cause.\nJust outside the nations capital, in April of this year, two Fairfax County police officers shot and killed an Arlington County police detective after he initiated a traffic stop less than a quarter of a mile outside of his jurisdiction. Following light media attention, both officers were immediately placed on paid leave, however no charges were filed and one officer was later promoted.\nIn another incident, this time in Florida, a Coral Gables SWAT team carried out what authorities later described as a late-night no-knock drug raid on a rival police department four days after losing a state-funded softball tournament. During the raid, Coral Gables police utilized a Mine-Resistant Armored Personnel vehicle (MRAP) to breach the rival departments main entrance before firing tear gas and stun grenades into the building using Department of Defense-issued shoulder-fired grenade launchers.\nThis militarized mindset coupled with high testosterone levels creates a dangerous environment that, as weve seen time and time again, can easily escalate beyond the walls of the department, said former FBI Special Agent Ricardo Gutierrez. According to the FBIs 2014 Uniform Crime Report, nearly 1 in 10 American police officers engaged in some form of aggressive action against officers from another department that year.

Forty-one year-old Judith Harrington was taking her sisters black lab for a walk through downtown Manhattan when she encountered a suspicious device in an alley near Fifth Avenue. I wasnt exactly sure what it was, Judith told Fox 5 NY, but I had a feeling in my gut that it was meant to harm people.\nMinutes after Harrington called 911, a heavily armed NYPD emergency response team arrived on the scene and prepared to enter a nearby Syrian-owned business which police believed was linked to the suspicious device.Officers used a breaching charge to blow open the shops locked entrance before entering the building with their guns raised.\nOnce inside, police detained three employees who were found to be in possession of devices similar to the one reported by Mrs. Harrington. Members of the NYPDs bomb squad used a bomb-disposal robot to perform a controlled demolition of the devices prior to inspection.\nAuthorities later determined the devices -which turned out to be iPhones, were harmless. The iPhone is a high-end cellular phone popular in many parts of the world, including the Middle East. The Manhattan shop that sells the devices, known simply as the Apple Store, is one of thousands across the United States and is owned by Apple, the same company that produces the iPhone.\nHowever, authorities say the founder of Apple, a man by the name of Steve Jobs, is the son of a Syrian migrant. Were currently looking into this information, said FBI Special Agent Addison Brewer, who added, Looking at this from a national security perspective, its hard to imagine why an individual of Syrian descent would choose to open an electronics shop in New York City.\nSpecial Agent Brewer noted that Jobs father is from the Syrian city of Aleppo, a major supply point for the Islamic State.\nNew York Citys mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at a joint press conference with the NYPD, called Judith Harrington a hero for exhibiting quick thinking in the face of danger and presented her with a key to the city. The average American isnt an explosive ordnance expert, he said.

What began as a low-key happy hour among coworkers last Thursday ended with one Secret Service agent dead, a second in jail, and the agency reeling fromyet another high profile scandal. According to the Metropolitan Police Department, about a dozen off-duty agents arrived at a popular steakhouse and bar near the Four Seasons hotel in Georgetown, shortly after 6:30 p.m. Saturday evening.\nBartender Woody Boyd, who served the agents, told FOX 5 DC the group was initially well-mannered and cordial but as the night progressed and the alcohol flowed, the groups atmosphere darkened. They got pretty rowdy, Boyd recalled. So much so that patrons around them started moving to other tables. Boyd said the agents were very vocal about their work, going out of their way to tell everyone around them that they were part of the presidents security detail.\nAccording to Boyd and others at the steakhouse Thursday night, it was around nine oclock when the agents engaged in a loud and heated discussion concerning official White House security protocols. I just remember hearing something about the safety of the presidents daughters, said a woman who spoke to FOX 5 DC on the condition of anonymity. Metropolitan Police investigators believe the alcohol-fueled discussion evolved into a rudimentary plan to test the integrity of White House security protocols by staging a mock kidnapping.\nOutdoor CCTV cameras at the Four Seasons show the agents left the restaurant at approximately 10:45 p.m., leaving behind an unpaid bar tab totaling over $1200. From there, investigators believe the heavily intoxicated agents drove straight to the White House where they bypassed security and attempted to infiltrate the presidential living quarters. Details at this point are sparse but it is believed the mock abduction failed before the agents could reach the First Daughters. All but two of the agents were detained by Uniformed Secret Service officers. Special Agents Samuel Fisher and Harry Tasker fled the White House grounds in two armored presidential limousines.\nApproximately seventeen minutes later, at 11:53 p.m., the two limousines were spotted by Maryland State Police heading north toward Rockville on I-270. Officers made several unsuccessful attempts to stop the vehicles and a chase ensued. A spokesman for the Maryland State Police, Captain Leon S. Kennedy, told reporters the following day, Certain modifications on these vehicles, such as bulletproof tires, hindered our ability to quickly and effectively pacify the situation. Captain Kennedy described the chase as chaotic, saying the armored limos reached speeds in excess of 120 mph and displayed a complete disregard for the safety of other drivers.\nA local news stations traffic chopper was passing over I-270 and caught the last few minutes of the chase on camera, which ended shortly after one of the armored limousines, driven by Special Agent Samuel Fisher, veered off the highway and slammed into a bridge embankment before exploding in flames. Captain Kennedy said the limo was going 109 mph when it impacted the concrete embankment. There was nothing left, he said.\nMinutes later, Maryland State Police were able to corner the second presidential limo and persuade Special Agent Tasker, albeit at gunpoint, to surrender peacefully. After failing a field sobriety test, Agent Tasker, a seven year veteran, told police he was on official business and involved in a mock kidnapping operation.\nThe Secret Service and the White House have remained mostly silent on the incident, with Secret Service Director Ethan Hunts office releasing a two sentence statement to the press saying the Service had recently conducted a training exercise.\nThis debacle comes prior to the arrest of a Secret Service officer Friday night for destruction of property and burglary after allegedly trying to break into a private home in the District.

Lee told Real News Right Now that upon his death, President Obamas body will embalmed and placed inside a glass sarcophagus where it will remain on display in the centers Grand Hall for one year, after which it will be permanently relocated to the mausoleum.

Former Army Lieutenant James Steven Patterson, Corporal Joseph Griffin, and Private Mike Slauson are scheduled to appear before the ICC Monday morning where they will face war crimes charges for acts allegedly committed during Operation Iraqi Freedom.\nChief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, attorney Klaus Mueller, spoke with reporters Friday afternoon, saying, We find crimes committed during war to be particularly heinous, therefore it is our duty to see that justice is swiftly served, he said, adding, We have a very strong case against these three men.\nCourt records allege that on 8 July 2007 Army Lieutenant James Patterson and Private Mike Slauson were traveling in two United States Army Humvees going southbound on Saadoun Street toward Firdos Square in central Baghdad. Witnesses state both vehicles were traveling well above the posted speed limit as they approached a four-way intersection clearly marked with traffic signals. As they approached the intersection, Lieutenant Patterson and Private Slauson directed their Humvees into oncoming traffic and plowed through the intersection at excessive speeds, during which Pattersons Humvee struck another vehicle traveling perpendicular to it, causing it to impact two other vehicles.\nThe documents go on to say that despite hitting another vehicle, both Patterson and Slauson sped through the intersection without stopping. As a resultfour civilian vehicles were damaged and eleven people injured, including a sixty-seven year old Iraqi woman who suffered a concussion and was taken to a hospital by ambulance.\nLt. James Patterson and Pvt. Slauson are each facing three counts of war crimes. The specific charges include reckless driving, failure to stop at a stop sign, and fleeing the scene of an accident. If convicted, both men could serve up to thirty days in jail. We intend to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law and provide the Iraqi people with the justice they so desperately seek, Mueller said.\nAdditionally, Corporal Joseph Griffin is facing one count, with the charge of littering.

Bailey said she takes the bus to her nursing job at Northwestern Memorial Hospital every morning and has never encountered anything like what transpired Wednesday morning. Working in the ER, I see a lot, a visibly shaken Bailey told CBS Chicago.

Shortly before boarding, authorities say al-Qubaisi, who is Muslim, consumed nearly six helpings of Dhal, a popular Pakistani dish consisting of rice and lentils that has been known to cause excessive gas. This was a deliberate and premeditated act, Sergeant Monica Hernandez, a spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department, told reporters.\nAccording to witnesses, al-Qubaisiwas sweating profusely as he took a vacant seat towards the rear of the bus. I remember glancing over my shoulder and seeing this guy who was just drenched in sweat, recalled Azad Mustafa. I didnt want to stare but he was belching loudly. The fifty-one year-old Kurdish shoe salesman said al-Qubaisi looked uneasy and appeared to be swaying in his seat. Suddenly there was this horriblesound and the air became very hot and thick. I remember smelling something ripe and thats when I lost consciousness. Mustafa latertold CBS Chicago that the incident gave him flashbacks to the 1988 Halabja chemical attack in southern Kurdistan, of which he is a survivor.\nA spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation confirmed that the incident is being investigated as a possible act of terrorism. What we know at this point is that Muhammed al-Qubaisi was born in Afghanistan and emigrated to the United States with his family in May of 1993 when he was three years old, announced FBI Special Agent Richard Ross during a joint press conference with the Chicago Police Department.

The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision announced today that it will start the first round of testing this week for a soon-to-be nationwide program meant to deter repeat offenders from committing future crimes. The new program, known as Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy, is modeled after the three-drug combination which many states use against those condemned to die by lethal injection.\nAs of Monday, New York Citys main jail complex, known as Rikers Island, will become the first U.S. prison to implement Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy. The prisons North Infirmary now houses several rehabilitation chambers similar in design to the execution chamber at San Quentin State Prison in California.\nFollowing intake, inmates deemed eligible for rehabilitation therapy undergo a brief psychological evaluation before being transferred to the infirmary ward, said Assistant Deputy Warden James L. Rosa. Eligibility is determined based on any prior convictions the inmate might have and whether or not theyve previously served time in a New York state correctional facility, Rosa explained.\nOnce prison officials have deemed an inmate eligible for Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy, they are transferred to the rehabilitation chamber where they are strapped down on a gurney while specially trained members of the infirmary staff prep them for the procedure. The reason you often hear this process referred to as less lethal injection is because its quite simply that. Once the drugs are administered, the inmate is immediately subjected to incomprehensible pain, Assistant Deputy Warden Rosa said. The procedure is meant to simulate imminent death, he continued. The desired outcome, of course, is that the experience will leave the inmate with a renewed desire to abandon a life of crime all together.\nThe main difference between Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy and lethal injection, according to Dr. Jay Goldberg, the programs founder, is the elimination of pentobarbital. In 2010, pentobarbital replaced sodium thiopentalas the first drug administered during the execution process. Pentobarbital is an ultra-fast acting drug that, upon injection, renders the recipient into a medically induced coma within a matter of seconds.\nWhat weve done is remove the anesthetic aspect from the equation, Dr. Goldberg said, continuing, The patient is completely awake and alert throughout the entire procedure. Prison staff then administer an injection of pancuronium bromide, a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant which induces moderate paralysis of the respiratory system and simulates suffocation. This is immediately followed by a second injection of potassium chloride which affects the electrical conduction of the heart muscle.\nUnder normal circumstances, this combination would result in a total collapse of the respiratory system followed by a massive cardiac arrest and subsequent death, Dr. Goldberg explained. But for the purpose of rehabilitation, were administering a non-lethal dose. Dr. Goldberg would not disclose the specific dosage used for each drug but said preliminary testing on lab rats proved the dosages to be non fatal in eight out of ten cases.\nDr. Goldberg stressed that Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy was designed to performed on inmates who are considered by the state to be repeat offenders. The idea is that our program will prevent recidivism. Habitual offenders will be far less likely to continue down a path of self-destruction after experiencing Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy, Dr. Goldberg predicted. In essence, it gives many offenders a firsthand look at what for so many others is a last stop: the execution chamber. But unlike so many others, these inmates will receive a second chance to do the right thing.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Known as Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy, it is modeled after the three-drug combination which many states use for lethal injection."}

Abbott as two service members from the Texas Army National Guard removed the weapon from its polymer case and prominently displayed it at the governors feet.\nCritics and gun-control advocates alike say the Javelin Portable Anti-Tank Missile is not a rifle at all but a dangerous anti-aircraft weapon designed to destroy armored vehicles, helicopters, and buildings. However, according to the NRAs Executive Vice President, Wayne LaPierre, The Javelin, by definition, meets all the characteristics of a rifle. Its a shoulder-fired weapon that fires a single projectile.\nJust because the single projectile happens to be a 127-millimeter high explosive warhead with an automatic self-guidance system, proponents say the Javelin, like other large-bore rifles in its class, is prone to unfair discrimination. Everythings bigger in Texas, explained Gov. Abbott. Especially our guns. The governor boasted that he personally owns two Javelin Portable Anti-Tank Missile rifles. I mostly use em for hunting boar, he added with a chuckle.\nWith an MSRP of $246,000, the Javelin Portable Anti-Tank Missile rifle is primarily geared toward advanced shooters. Its not a great beginner rifle, partly due to the price tag, said Robert Henderson, a contributing writer forAmerican Huntermagazine. But if you can afford it and you have a good amount of land, its a helluva lot of fun to shoot.\nTexas is the second state to declare an official rifle this week. On Wednesday, February 28th, the Barrett M82.50 caliber anti-materiel rifle became the Official Rifle of Tennessee.

A specialized unit within the group known as Echo Squad, which excels at aircraft hijacking and surprise assault operations, staged a daring nighttime rescue operation last week, Icelands largest newspaper,Frttablai,reported on Friday.\nAccording to the National Commissioner of Icelandic Police, forty-eight year-old Jack Davies of Glasgow was one of five hostages held captive by a heavily armed group led by a man known only as Father Kristmas. Icelandic authorities say the cult had been living in a subterranean cave on the island of Elliaey. As stated by Davies during a post-rescue debriefing, several dozen dwarfs armed with Kalashnikov rifles stood guard while their captives were forced to work nearly twenty hours a day making toys.\nWe were kept underground and made to sleep and work in a very rudimentary workshop, Davies is quoted as saying. If we inquired about water or wanted to relieve ourselves, we were beaten. Those who tried to communicate with one another were shot without question and their bodies discarded beneath a ghastly juniper tree that appeared to be decorated with human remains. Davies went on to say that as punishment, he and other hostages were often forced to sing Christmas carols until they collapsed from exhaustion.\nThe Viking Squads official spokesperson, Chief Inspector Gunnhallur Heimirsson, said that just before sunrise on August 1, a team of twelve operatives mounted a surprise amphibious assault on the island ofElliaey in an effort to rescue Davies and four others, including two Americans. The squad members were quickly met by hostile elements who engaged them with small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades, the chief inspector said. A ninety minute gun battle ensued, resulting in the deaths of more than seventy dwarfs, many of whom were armed with red and white striped clubs, which Icelandic operatives described as lethal candy canes.\nRegrettably, all but one of the hostages died at the hands of their captors during the operation, Heimirsson said, adding that Mr. Davies had likely been spared because, prior to the raid, he had been locked inside a toy chest as punishment for failing to assemble a childs battery-powered motorcycle.

The 21-year-old is facing thirty charges for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy to bomb a place of public use resulting in death.\nLionel Hutz, the lead attorney handling Tsarnaevs case, spoke to reporters on the courthouse steps, saying,The Watertown police, and other law enforcement agencies, violated my clients civil rights countless times on the night of April 19th, 2013. Regardless of the charges levied against my client, he is an American citizen, and therefore innocent until proven guilty. Mr. Hutz said he intends to use police testimony from the federal trial against Tsarnaev to show what he calls an excessive and brutal use of force as a result of a heavily militarized law enforcement operation.\nTed Buckland, a member of Tsarnaevs defense team, told this reporter that in the moments leading up to his arrest, while Dozhokhar, who was unarmed, sought refuge inside the boat, officers from Watertown and other agencies unleashed a barrage of preemptive gunfire into the craft prior to deploying dozens of concussion grenades. Buckland says the defense team is seeking $150 million in punitive damages from the Watertown Police Department, part of which will be used to pay for Tsarnaevs defense in federal court.\nTsarnaevs defense team believes they have a rock solid case against Waterford PD. In the last decade weve seen an unprecedented rise in the use of excessive force against American citizens, particularly minorities. This case is no different from Ferguson where we had Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen, gunned down by an overzealous police officer, and the subsequent response to that was to deploy, basically, a militarized force into the city resulting in innumerable civil rights violations. Its simply unacceptable, Hutz says.\nDozhokhar Tsarnaev is being charged for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing which killed 3 spectators and injured an estimated 264 people. In addition he faces charges for the murder of Sean A. Collier, an MIT police officer. Federal prosecutors announced last week that, following a conviction, they will seek the death penalty.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Dozhokhar Tsarnaev filed a civil suit against the Watertown Police Department during a hearing at the Boston Municipal Court this morning."}

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reportedly consideringa possible run forthe White House in 2016, Canadas leading news agency, CBC News, reported Friday. The forty-three year-old Ottawa native, who was elected into office in November of this year, has been calledthe Alex Trebek of politicsfor his soft-spoken mannerisms andintellect, often consideredrare traits in the political realm.\nBordering the northern half of the continentalUnited States, Canadaisperhaps best known for its maple syrup. The popular pancake topping isCanadas largest export andmakes up formore than 70% of the countrysgross domestic product. Since taking office less than forty days ago,Mr. Trudeau has more than tripled Canadas maple syrup production and, in the process, created more than seventy new jobs. Prime Minister Trudeau has done more for Canada in one month than Wayne Gretzky did in his entire career, boasted fellow Canadian William Shatner during a recent interview with The Toronto Star.\nPrime Minister Trudeau made national headlines againthis week when he traveled to Torontos Pearson International Airport topersonally greetmore thanone hundred and sixty Syrianswho had arrived seeking refuge from an increasingly dire humanitariancrisis in their war-torn nation. In Trudeaus own words, the decision to accept an estimated25,000 Syrian refugees was Canadas way of showing the world how to open our hearts.\nDespite Mr. Trudeaus perceived good intentions, the move has left asickly taste in the mouths ofmany Americans. That sort of thing wouldnt fly here in the United States, said George Allen, a seniorcampaign strategist for Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Its contradictory to our values as a nation and quite frankly, its un-American. Allencalled Mr. Trudeaus decision to accept unvetted outsiders questionable, adding that had it happened in the U.S.,Mr. Trudeauwould almost certainlyface a congressional investigation.\nNonetheless, Justin Trudeau believes he has what it takes to run a real country. The Canadianprime minister told CBCNewson Friday that he has just as much a right to the U.S. presidency as former Canadian citizenand currentU.S. senatorTed Cruz. In fact, Mr. Trudeau said, My record on immigration far outweighs his by a longshot. According to Canadas bureau of statistics,otherwise knownas StatCan,approximately 91% of theCanadian population lives within one hundred yards of the U.S. border. And yet were able to remain quite comfortably on our side, Trudeau said.\nAmerican voters may take solace in knowing that in 2014, Canadas Border Service Agency reported less than twenty illegal border crossings along its 1,538 mile long border with the United States. The majority were accidental, said Canadas Minister of Public Safety, Ralph Goodale. Usually its a hiker or a hunter who strayed a bit too far north, Goodale told Real News Right Now, adding, In 2013, we did have a Latino gentleman attempt to enterthe countrywithout the proper paperwork. Minister Goodale said the man later found the documents in his vehicles glove compartment and was subsequently granted entry.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "OTTAWA, On. - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reportedly considering a possible run for the White House in 2016...."}

During a White House-hosted dinner celebrating the Islamic holy month of Ramadan Monday evening, President Obama, flanked by select cabinet members, announced he has signed into law an executive order banning the manufacturing, distribution, and possession of Confederateflags and other memorabilia.\nWhen our values are threatened, we come together as one nation, Mr. Obama said. As Americans, we insist that nobody should be targeted because of who they are, or what they look like, who they love, how they worship. We stand united against these hateful acts.\nThe executive order is the 209th issued by President Obama since taking office and is being hailed as a major victory against racism. Based largely on Germanys anti-Nazi laws, the order, which officially goes into effect on June 18th, makes it illegal to possess any item or symbol bearing the sign of the Confederacy. President Obama, calling the Confederate flag a symbol of hatred, compared its history to that off the Third Reich, saying, You dont see government buildings in Germany flying the Nazi flag, we shouldnt have to see the Confederate flag here.\nAlso included in the executive order is an amendment to 18 U.S. Code 249, allowing for any individual or entity found to be in violation of the law to be prosecuted under the federal hate crimes statute. Under federal law, the punishment carries a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. In light of recent events, Im inclined to believe a ten-year sentence is far too lenient, Al Sharpton told CNNs Wolf Blitzer today. Blitzer, who agreed with Sharpton, said many in Washington have echoed similar sentiment.\nUnder orders from the White House, the Department of Justice, while working in conjunction with local and state law enforcement agencies, will, in the coming weeks, launch a nationwide operation to halt manufacturing and distribution of the soon-to-be-illegal contraband. According to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the brunt of the operation, spearheaded by the FBI, will focus on the deep south and Midwestern regions of the U.S., However, state and local agencies across the country are being asked to conduct their own seizures.\nIn light of the new law, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, a Republican, ordered the immediate removal of a Confederate flag from the grounds of the capital building in Columbia today. In order to stay in compliance with federal law, I have instructed officials at all local and state facilities throughout South Carolina to remove and destroy this contraband, effective immediately, the governor said.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "President Obama announced he has signed into law an executive order banning the manufacturing, distribution, and possession of Confederate flags."}

From a distance, the Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center could pass for one of the many Anglo Territorial dwellings that pepper the eastern edge of the Mojave Desert. However, by the time you reach Fourth Ring Road, the picturesque Arizonan landscape gives way to a dusty narrow street lined with palm and date trees, flanked by the occasional dilapidated Toyota or Hyundai.\nThe Trump Organization, proprietor of the Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center, has worked hard to maintain a sense of realism and authenticity that is not lost on its visitors.\nI and two other journalists from NBC Nightly News have been invited to partake in a private tour of the theme park a few months ahead of its scheduled grand opening. Upon passing through the theme parks rear entrance, located just off Fourth Ring Road, we are met with a guard-house staffed by six theme park employees wearing Libyan police uniforms and armed with realistic looking AK-47 assault rifles. They wave us into the compound showing little interest.\nOnce inside the gate, we disembark from our vehicle and are promptly greeted by Andrew McKee, the theme parks General Manager. After asking us to sign a waiver, McKee explains the purpose of the Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center is to present visitors with a realistic and unadulterated view of the events that took place at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.\nMcKee explains that upon entering the theme park, we will witness, firsthand, a four-hour reenactment of the assault on the U.S. Consulate by Al Qaeda fighters. Here at the Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center, we employ a staff of roughly two hundred and fifty actors of Middle Eastern and African descent who play the role of the Islamic militants that carried out the worst terrorist attack on American soil since September 11, 2001, McKee said, adding, Throughout each reenactment, we utilize approximately three and a half million dollars worth of pyrotechnics.\nJust before dark, we are ushered through the large oak double doors leading into the U.S. Consulate building, where each of us receives a glossy index card, similar to those distributed at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., which feature one of the Americans killed during the attack. We are told that, during the reenactment, each of us will follow the final moments of the American whose name and picture appears on the card. I have received U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith.\nWithin moments of receiving our index cards, the sound of automatic gunfire can be heard from somewhere outside the compound. Then, the power to the Consulate goes out, save for a few dimly lit emergency lights, followed by the roar of an alarm. I can hear sounds of sporadic gunfire getting progressively louder, then suddenly, without warning, I am thrown into my colleague from NBC Nightly News as a massive explosion hits the side of the building.\nWe are engulfed in thick black smoke and I can feel the intense heat from the blast all over my body. We are choking and clawing our way to safety as Al Qaeda fighters outside lob grenades over the wall surrounding the U.S. Consulate. Simultaneously, militants are pouring into the compound under a volley of automatic weapons fire backed by truck-mounted artillery and anti-aircraft guns. Amid the chaos, we are told we have to reach the safe haven, a secure room within the Consulate.\nSomeone shoves what turns out to be an M4 carbine into my arms as Im told I must defend myself and protect the Ambassador. Another explosion rocks the building as we attempt to navigate the dark corridor. I feel a rush of hope wash over me as someone shouts that a Quick Reaction Force has been summoned, yet, in the end, we never encounter them.\nWe are abruptly directed into a room and given a brief respite from the intense violence happening outside. It takes me a moment to get my bearings before I realize were in a dark bedroom. In the corner of the room, in the bed, there appears to be a woman resembling Hillary Clinton sound asleep, and next to her, on the nightstand, I can make out the greenish glow of an alarm clock reading 3 a.m. I suddenly realize a telephone has been ringing nonstop since we entered the room.\nAs quickly as we came in, we are rushed out of the room into an ultra-violent madness that seems to grow more intense by the second. Most of the Consulate is on fire now and we encounter groups of Al Qaeda fighters who are clad in flak jackets and ski masks, shouting Allahu Akbar while charging us with machine guns.\nFollowing the end of the four-hour reenactment, we are met, once again, by Andrew McKee, who passes out bottled water and granola bars, while thanking us for coming to the Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center to witness this tragic and avoidable moment in American history. We are then asked to make a purchase at the Gift Shop before departing the theme park, I dont find anything particularly appealing in the shop, which is mostly stocked with conservative literature, but I end up buying a Limited Edition Lego U.S. Consulate Benghazi set for my nephew.\nThe Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center is due to officially open September 11, 2015 and offers group rates as well as individual tickets which can be purchased online or by calling the theme park directly. The standard fee for adults as $49.99, however seniors and children under 12 are eligible for a heavily discounted price of $9.11.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "The Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center could pass for one of the many Anglo Territorial dwellings that pepper the eastern edge of the Mojave Desert."}

In response to backlash from rights groups over the passing of a lawthat blocks local governments from passing anti-discrimination rules which could protect gay and transgender people, North Carolina governor Pat McCroy on Saturday proposed new legislation that would give the LGBT community their own restrooms and changing facilities at both public and privately owned venues.\nWhat were proposing here is very similar to what you saw in the 50s when blacks and whites were assigned separate bathrooms and drinking fountains, Governor McCroy explained. Its a very fair proposal and, frankly, I think its something that folks on both sides can learn to embrace and appreciate.\nIf passed, the new law would require people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender to use state-approved bathrooms and changing facilities that are, according to Governor McCroy, located a safe distance from facilities frequented by children and the elderly. Specifically, the law states that LGBT-only restrooms must be stationed no less than fifty yards away from traditional facilities.\nFirst and foremost, this is about protecting our children from predators, declared Gov. McCroy, who added the LGBT-only facilities are merely the first step in a series of measures meant to keep children out of harms way. In the coming months, my office will propose further legislation that, when signed into law, will require any North Carolina resident over the age of thirteen who identifies as a homosexual or transgender individual, to submit their personal information to a mandatory LGBT registry maintained by state law enforcement.\nGovernor McCroy warned that failure to do so would result in a one-year prison sentence and a $25,000 fine.

The White House and U.S. Capitol were evacuated today when an unidentified flying object entered restricted airspace above the nations capital. At approximately 10:21 a.m. local time, F-16 fighter jets left Joint Base Andrews in Southern Maryland to intercept the object, which, according to defense officials, did not show up on military or civilian radar.\nThe object was first spotted over Baltimore and subsequently reported to emergency services by some two hundred individuals, Major General Scott Borland of the U.S. Air Force told reporters during an emergency briefing at the Pentagon. At that time it was reported that the object was headed southwest in the direction of Washington D.C. Baltimore City Emergency Services immediately alerted NORAD, at which point three F-16s were scrambled out of Joint Base Andrews with orders to intercept the object.\nAccording to the Department of Defense and eye witnesses on the ground, a solid-black triangular-shaped object traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and emitting virtually no sound, entered restricted airspace above Washington, D.C. at approximately 10:27 a.m. EST. I watched it fly over the [National] mall and it slowed down so quickly, it was unbelievable, it was like it was just hovering there, Bethany Moss, a curator at the Museum of Natural History told Fox 5 DC. One second it was there and the next it just shot upwards into the sky and thats when we heard the fighter jets.\nMajor General Borland said that upon making contact with U.S. fighter jets, the object made several defensive maneuvers, which he described as being impossible for modern aircraft to achieve. When one of our pilots came within firing range, the object deployed a sort of high-energy laser weapon which disabled the F-16s flight control systems, causing it to crash. Immediately after, the remaining fighters lost contact with the object.\nA YouTube video uploaded by amateur photographer Shane Fager shows the F-16 hurdling through the sky and narrowly missing the roof of the John F. Kennedy Center before crashing into the Potomac River. The video, and many like it, which surfaced on YouTube just minutes after the event, show fighter jets buzzing the U.S. capital, but the unidentified object itself is, mysteriously, nowhere to be found. It was using some kind of cloaking device, said Major General Borland. This thing didnt show up on our air defense systems, it didnt show up on any sort of radar, even flash photography and cell phone video couldnt pick it up.\nThe U.S. Coast Guard, working in conjunction with the Arlington County Fire Department, has initiated a search of the Potomac River and the surrounding area for the missing F-16 pilot.

An Indiana man who had a recent near-death experience after tragic car accident left him in a coma says he made a shocking discovery during a brief trip to the afterlife. Forty-eight year-old Thomas Miller of Fort Wayne, who sustained a traumatic brain injury and lost both his legs after a head-on collision with a tractor-trailer, called the experience a turning point in his life. Its really put things into perspective for me, Miller told WFFT News, a local Fox affiliate.\nImmediately after the crash, Miller described being wrapped in a blanket of warmth and feeling his body rise through the mangled remains of his Toyota Prius and up into the sky by a loving presence. But Miller says once he passed through the pearly gates, things took a nasty turn. There were dinosaurs everywhere, an emotional Miller told WFFT. Some were as tall as buildings and they were just killing and eating everyone. There was so much chaos; so much destruction.\nDr. Brian Rosenbaum, a neurologist at St. Joseph Hospital in Fort Wayne, says its common for people who have suffered a traumatic brain injury to experience vision-like dreams. To put it simply, when you have a multi-sensory disintegration occur at the temporoparietal junction, the result is a disruption of various cognitive functions that regulate the brains ability to self-process, Rosenbaum explained. This is when people might believe they are having a so-called near-death experience.\nHowever, Miller is certain his experience wasnt the result of a disruption of his cognitive functions. I personally witnessed a pack of velociraptors chase down a group of angels and tear them limb from limb, he told WFFT News. It was hands down the most horrific thing Ive ever seen in my life. Miller, who considers himself a devout Catholic, said the Heaven depicted in the bible is a total war zone. I just cant wrap my head around how something like this is possible.\nFortunately for Miller, Father Robert Parsons of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis might have an answer. Several years ago, His Holiness Pope Francis declared that all of Gods creatures have a place in the Kingdom of Heaven, Father Parsons toldReal News Right Now. In the event this proclamation extends to the dinosaurs  and there is no evidence it doesnt  then we must assume there are millions of them in Heaven. After all, these creatures ruled the earth for nearly sixty-five million years.\nAs far as Thomas Miller is concerned, Father Parsons explanation offers little in the way of comfort. After his experience, Miller says the concept of life after death no longer holds any appeal. Even so, I keep playing the events over and over in my mind, he said. The last thing I remember was Saint Peter grabbing me by the collar, shaking me, and yelling, Stop sending people here, its not safe! Then I woke up in the hospital and found out Id lost eight months of my life.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "A man who had a recent near-death experience after tragic car accident left him in a coma made a shocking discovery during a brief trip to the afterlife."}

County officials say a typo on the official search warrant lead law enforcement officers to the wrong location, a warehouse in Casa Grande, where, instead of a methamphetamine operation, they found a Boeing 777 commercial airliner and a sedan.\nUpon entering the premises, Pinal County Sheriffs deputies observed a large commercial airliner parked in the center of the warehouse, Pinal Countys Chief Investigator Adam Hutch told reporters. The aircraft in question is white, with a gray underbelly and features red and blue stripes down the middle of fuselage. Hutch said the planes tail prominentlydisplays the all-too-familiar red and blue logo of Malaysian Airlines. Additionally, its registration number, 9M-MRO, matches that of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean on March 8, 2014.\nRight now we are trying to determine the origin of this aircraft, Hutch said, adding that airliner was carrying less than a quarter tank of fuel. Public records show the warehouse in question is located on privately owned land in the outskirts of Casa Grande and has been on lease to CNN since March 6, 2014. The twenty-four hour cable news channel declined a request to comment from this reporter but Ted Turner, owner of Turner Broadcasting System Inc, the parent company of CNN, told The New York Times that he found the discovery very peculiar, and added, I have no idea why that would be there.\nDuring CNNs The Situation Room Tuesday, Wolf Blitzer was pointedly asked by a guest what his thoughts on the aircraft were. Mr. Blitzer blinked several times while staring into the camera before saying, Im sorry, could you repeat that? We seem to be having some issues with the mic. Blitzer, citing technical difficulties, began to tap on his earpiece before removing it entirely to inspect it. He began to blow on the earpiece, presumably to remove dust or hardened ear wax, as the segment cut to an unusually long commercial break.\nIn addition to the Boeing 777 commercial airliner, Pinal Countys Narcotics Task Force also discovered a black BMW 328i sedan parked in the warehouse. The vehicle was found to be registered to CNN anchor Don Lemon. Authorities said the car was empty except for a spent tear gas canister stamped Ferguson Police Department which was found under the passenger seat.\nIn a statement released by his publicist, Don Lemon said hes never even been to Arizona and accused the Pinal County Sheriffs Office of racial profiling. Lemon, who drives a Toyota Prius, went on to say he wouldnt be caught dead in a vehicle reminiscent of the Third Reich.\nEarly Wednesday morning sheriffs deputies arrested CNNs Anderson Cooper as he attempted to gain access to the warehouse which has been sealed off by law enforcement pending an investigation. Deputies say Cooper arrived at the scene via helicopter at approximately 7:15 a.m. Rather than land, Cooper, who was wearing a bulletproof Press vest and wrap-around sunglasses, rappelled to the ground from the hovering helicopter. Deputies brought Cooper down with a Taser after he attempted to place a breaching charge on a door leading into the warehouse. He later told investigators he was there to set the record straight.\nOn August 2 a piece of wreckage belonging to a Boeing 777, the same type of aircraft as MH370, washed up on an island in the Indian Ocean. The object was sent to France for further analysis but Malaysian authorities are confident the wreckage belongs to the missing MH370.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "DEA agents and sheriff's deputies with the Pinal County Narcotics Task Force may have found missing MH370 while serving a drug warrant Tuesday."}

Mexican Federal Police estimate upwards of two hundred people were killed, among them women and children. At least a dozen others are reported missing.\nA journalist affiliated with Blog Del Narco, which chronicles the Mexican drug war, told the El Paso Times he witnessed six Toyota style pickup trucks, some with mounted machine guns, seal off a portion of Federal Highway 45 before occupants got out and began firing indiscriminately into traffic. The massacre lasted for a heart-pounding fifteen minutes and ended with twenty-six dead and at least sixty more who were wounded in the attack. According to one witness there were bodies everywhere.\nMexican Federal Police speculate the attack was meant to divert attention away from a larger strike that took place less than an hour later. Commissary General Mariano Lopez of the Federal Police, speaking with reporters Monday afternoon, said approximately sixty officers responded to reports of gunfire coming from a compound just two miles east of Federal Highway 45. The compound, which Mexican authorities say was a drug distribution center operated by Mexicos largest and most dangerous criminal organization, the Sinaola cartel, had been under surveillance by the military in conjunction with the countrys anti-drug efforts.\nCommissary General Lopez said during the press briefing that upon arrival police forces were met with heavy gunfire coming from inside the compound. Initially we thought these are cartel members or Los Zetas trying to kill us, he said. Federal Police sent in reinforcements including a tactical team on board two Black Hawk helicopters, one of which was shot down by what authorities believe was a shoulder-fired rocket launcher. Thirteen Federal Police Officers were killed in crash.\nIn what could be an embarrassing admission for the Federal Police, Commissary General Lopez told reporters, We were completely overwhelmed. Police were forced to retreat from the compound due to a lack of readily available resources in the area. Lopez explained that his agency is well equipped to take on drug traffickers, having received training from top law enforcement agencies in the United States, however we do not have the resources to take on well-trained foreign fighters.\nMexicos president, Enrique Pena Nieto, has requested U.S. assistance in dealing with ISIS, saying in a televised address to the country, We cannot meet this threat alone. Meanwhile, President Obama pledged to beef up security and deploy additional National Guard units to the border.\nIn Ciudad Juarez, located eight miles south of El Paso, Texas, the streets were deserted Tuesday night. Juarez is a major trafficking point for illegal drug smugglers but there were virtually no signs of a cartel presence anywhere in the city. This reporter spoke with a local business owner who asked to remain anonymous out of fear for his life. People are afraid to go out. My store has been closed for three days and we are waiting to see what the army will do. Graffiti can be seen on several buildings and overpasses throughout Juarez, in both Arabic and Spanish, warning cartel members and residents alike to join us or die.\nFederal Highway 45 intersects Cuidad Juarez before ending at the U.S.-Mexico border. The attack occurred roughly ninety miles south of Juarez.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "As many as three hundred heavily armed gunmen, some bearing Islamic State insignia, stormed a compound in the northern region of Chihuahua, Mexico last week"}

Mere days after his escape from the Federal Social Readaption Center No. 1, a Mexican maximum security prison, the notorious drug kingpin known as El Chapo Guzman appeared in a video posted online in which he mocked U.S. and Mexican authorities by offering a startling reward for his own capture: Five million dollars worth of uncut Colombian cocaine.\nTo anyone listening, Guzman said, if you can find me and capture me, we will deliver to you one hundred and forty kilos of the purest China White in Mexico. The one minute and thirty-seven second video, which authorities believe was shot using a cellphone, appears to be taken in a small, dimly lit room.\nJudging by the walls, youre seeing a lot of what appears to be grime, or even mud. This was most likely filmed in an underground bunker, former DEA Special Agent Edwardo Fuentez told CNNs Wolf Blitzer on The Situation Room. Fuentez said the bunker could be located in some of the more remote areas of Mexicos Sierra Madre mountain range. These individuals are like rodents, they prefer to hide in the shadows, Fuentez said.\nAccording to Blitzer, who spoke with Mexican authorities early yesterday, the Mexican government has not publicly stated whether or not they have any information pertaining to Guzmans whereabouts. In situations like this one, its always possible they know more than theyre letting on, Blitzer said before glancing of camera and adding, I personally know of several people who would benefit substantially from this.\nActress Lindsey Lohan might be one of them. The twenty-nine year-old told The Hollywood Reporter today that she out-bid Jarret Stoll of the Los Angeles Kings Tuesday morning and has hired Academi, the private military contractor formerly known as Blackwater, to locate and capture Guzman. I just want to do the right thing and get these drugs off the street, Lohan said.\nHead of the ruthless Sinaloa Cartel, Guzman was serving a twenty-year and nine month sentence for a slew of charges including murder, drug trafficking, and money laundering. He was arrested in 1993 in Guatemala before being extradited to Mexico where he was placed in federal prison. Following his first escape in 2001, he was recaptured by Mexican authorities on February 22, 2014. On July 11, 2015 he escaped again, this time by way of an underground tunnel.

Documents released this week by whistle-blower website Wikileaks.org include a startling revelation about Edward Snowden that could threaten already shaky relations between the United States and Russia. The bundle of classified documents, reaching just over 15,000 pages, contains cables and internal documents from multiple U.S. and international intelligence agencies including the NSA and Britains MI5.\nIncluded in the files are dozens of documents linked to operation STARGAZR, a multinational task force set to defend Earth from intergalactic threats. Operation STARGAZR was first made public early last month by Real News, Right Now in an articlefeatured on this site.\nSeveral documents referencing operation STARGAZR point specifically to the existence of two unidentified satellites currently orbiting Earth. In a diplomatic cable designated TOP SECRET between a high-ranking official in South Korean military intelligence and the National Security Agency, an NSA official states attempts were made by USAF to shoot down SAT1 but failed due to highly advanced countermeasures deployed by the object.\nIt remains unclear exactly what those countermeasures were and if they resulted in any loss of life. Amid growing speculation, the Obama Administration has shown a staunch refusal to even acknowledge operation STARGAZR since the story first broke February 6.\nAlso contained in the leak are financial statements indicating former CIA system administrator Edward Snowden has been receiving monthly deposits from the National Security Agency. The deposits date back as far as May 15th, 2013, just five days before Snowden left Hawaii for Hong Kong, where he would release classified material to journalists.\nThis is not a mistake, says Retired U.S. Air Force General Buck Turgidson, who worked with the NSA from 1999 until late 2005. We have monthly transfers in the amount of $7,000, originating from a NSA front company, which typically pass through at least three financial institutions before arriving in a checking account operated by Edward Snowden.\nThe Obama Administration declined to comment on the transactions, saying it would not discuss classified material. However, General Turgidson, who helped design the PRISM program in its early stages, believes Snowden could be a double agent. I think the NSA deliberately leaked those files, Turgidson says, referring to the PRISM surveillance program, and they did so using Edward Snowden.What were seeing here is only the tip of the iceberg.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Documents released by whistle-blower website Wikileaks.org include a startling revelation about Edward Snowden."}

The National Aeronautic Space Administration detected a coronal mass ejection on the surface of the sun at 11:08 P.M. EST Tuesday night, NASAs Deputy Administrator Greta Johansen said during a press conference at 12:30 A.M. Wednesday morning. Calling it the largest in recorded history, Johansen said the ejection, a tremendous eruption of gas and magnetic energy, was immediately followed by the release of a massive solar flare. This will directly impact earth in less than seventy-two hours, Johansen said. We are facing an extinction-level event.\nNASA is working in conjunction with several foreign space agencies, including those in China and Russia, to determine the exact point of impact. Because of the sheer size of this enormous mass of energy, were dealing with an extraordinarily large impact zone ranging anywhere between four and five thousand miles, said Dr. Kenneth Parcell, who heads NASAs Space Weather Prediction Center. At this time all we know is that it will impact earth somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere approximately twenty-one hundred miles north of the Equator.\nBy NASAs own estimate, six of the earths seven continents are at risk of taking a direct hit. Solar flares have the ability to disrupt communication systems and its something that happens fairly often in our solar system, said Dr. Parcell. However, coupled with a coronal mass ejection, its a One-Two punch, its going to incinerate everything in its path.\nBoth NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency have confirmed that the Southern Hemisphere is unlikely to sustain a direct hit but warned that regions in close proximity to the impact area face the exponential risk of earthquakes, tsunamis, and nuclear fallout. Australia, South Africa, and South Americas eastern coast are considered safe zones in that they are least likely to experience loss of life on an extinction level.\nThe White House has announced President Barack Obama will address the nation on all networks at 11:00 A.M.

In the hours following the death of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who was shot and killed on June 18th by an unknown assassin, the Department of Defense, under orders from President Barack Obama, deployed an unspecified number of U.S. Navy SEALs and other special operations forces to Pyongyang with orders to take out the remaining North Korean leadership and secure the countrys nuclear facilities.\nOn June 20th, United States special operations forces, acting on my command, took control of eighteen nuclear facilities inside North Korea, President Obama told the nation and the world during a televised address today. Simultaneously, a second operation was carried out to eliminate top-tier government and military officials in Pyongyang. The Americans who took part in these operations exhibited extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed. They took great care to avoid civilian casualties.\nThe Department of Defense has yet to comment on the specifics of the mission but a Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told this reporter that the two-pronged operation was spearheaded by the Joint Special Operations Command and supported by three carrier strike groups in the Sea of Japan and the Korea Bay, a northern extension of the Yellow Sea.\nPresident Obama, flying aboard Air Force One, landed at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport in North Korea Saturday morning and was promptly whisked away to the capital city in an armored U.S. military convoy supported by helicopter gunships.
