In an effort to further prevent the spread of the Zika virus, the Centers for Disease Control on Tuesday issued a new travel advisory asking Americans who plan to travel to Central and South America this summer to pack plenty of cigarettes and tonic water.\nCigarette smoking actually has some health benefits in that in that it works as a natural deterrent to mosquitoes, Dr. Raymond Goodwin, an infectious disease specialist at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, explained. When you exhale tobacco smoke, you are  in a sense  creating a temporary force field around your body which mosquitoes are simply unable to penetrate.\nThe CDC is asking those who are traveling to regions and countries where Zika is most prevalent, including Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Haiti, Honduras, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico, to consider postponing travel plans until more is known about the virus.\nIn the event travel is unavoidable, Dr. Goodwin said Americans  particularly pregnant women  who visit the affected regions should make a concentrated effort to smoke as many cigarettes as possible throughout the duration of their trip. If youre outdoors or in an area where mosquitoes are common, the best line of defense is frequent consumption of tonic water coupled with incessant smoking, Goodwin advised. Also, consider lathering yourself in bug spray and, if you can, keep a citronella candle burning nearby at all times.\nDr. Goodwin said by adhering to the necessary precautions, travelers are far less likely to contract the Zika virus through a mosquito bite. However, the CDC warns the possibility of catching it through sexual transmission remains high.\nTo further assist travelers in the protecting themselves against the Zika virus, the CDC, working in conjunction with the Transportation Security Administration, is issuing one free carton of Marlboro brand cigarettes to travelers who are destined for Central and South America for trips lasting one week or less.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "In an effort to further prevent the spread of the Zika virus, the Centers for Disease Control on Tuesday issued a new travel advisory asking Americans..."}

In response to a question regarding his policy on ISIS, Republican presidential candidate and billionaireDonald Trump told Meet the Press on Sunday that as Commander-in-Chief, he would authorize the use of nuclear weapons to combat Islamic extremism. Lets face it, these people are barbarians, Trump said. And thanks to Obamas failed policy in Iraq and Syria, theyre beheading Christians all over the world.\nMr. Trump said hes already conferred with a number of high-level active military officials and has put together a comprehensive strategy to defeat the Islamic State within his first one hundred days in office. It starts with the deployment of four or five of our Ohio-class nuclear submarines to the Persian Gulf, Trump said. Were going to hit them and were going to hit them hard. Im talking about a surgical strike on these ISIS stronghold cities using Trident missiles.\nThe Trident is a submarine-launched ballistic missile equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, or MIRVs. With a payload of up to fourteen reentry vehicles, each carrying a 362-pound thermonuclear warhead with a yield of 100 kilotons, a single Trident has roughly seventy times the destructive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.\nTrumps plan to use thermonuclear weapons against ISIS-held areas such as the Syrian city of Al-Raqqahwould result in an astronomically high number of civilian casualties, according to CNN military analyst Peter Mansoor. Al-Raqqah alone has a population of over two hundred-thousand people, the vast majority of whom are not affiliated in any way with the Islamic State, Mansoor said. A strike of this magnitude would not only result in the loss of millions of innocent lives and infrastructure, but it would set diplomacy and stability in the region back at least a hundred years.\nCivilian casualties are an unfortunate reality of war according to Trump, who justified the use of nuclear weapons saying they send a clear message to those who conspire against America and her allies. Mr. Trump said that unlike past and present administrations, he possesses the moral fortitude to do what must be done to protect America. Were losing to China. Were losing to Mexico. We will not lose to ISIS, Trump said.\nThe Japanese and other nations called for increased restrictions on nuclear weapons Sunday as the world observed the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. The bombings, which forced Japan to surrender from the war, left over 200,000 dead.", "section": "Politics", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Donald Trump told Meet the Press on Sunday that as Commander-in-Chief, he would authorize the use of nuclear weapons to combat Islamic extremism."}

More than 43,000 worshipers were in attendance at Lakewood Church Saturday evening when Joel Osteen, Lakewoods Senior Pastor, reportedly levitated nearly ten feet above the stage following the conclusion of his sermon. People were hysterical, said Maya Rodriguez, who, like thousands of others in the Houston area, attends weekly services at the nondenominational megachurch.\nWitnesses say roughly forty-five minutes into the 7 P.M. service, Pastor Osteen suddenly appeared disoriented before suffering a violent coughing fit. His forehead and neck were just drenched in sweat, said Colton Bradshaw, a Houston native, who was seated with his wife in the second row. The events that followed, according to Bradshaw and corroborated by more than a thousand other witnesses, left worshipers feeling perplexed and, in many cases, terrified.\nOsteen reportedly fell to his knees on stage while clutching his chest. We thought he was having a heart attack, Bradshaw said. It was then that the charismatic pastor outstretched his arms, threw his head back, and violently arched his back. Dozens of cellphone videos taken by parishioners and uploaded to the popular media website YouTube show Pastor Osteen, seemingly in a trance-like state, rise from the stage. Screams and cries of disbelief from the congregation can be heard as Osteen levitates more than nine feet off the ground.\nIn one of the higher quality videos uploaded to YouTube by userTheChristianBlessing,Osteen can be seen hovering above the stage with his head slumped forward before, as one witness put it, suddenly awakening. As Pastor Osteen appears to hang with his arms outstretched in midair, he opens his mouth and, in a deep, commanding voice, says, I am the Alpha and the Omega. Then, his body drops like a rag doll to the ground where he remains motionless.\nColton Bradshaws wife, Karen, along with dozens of other worshipers, fainted during the ordeal and later required medical attention, but Bradshaw himself remained alert throughout the entire spectacle, which lasted less than four minutes. When he spoke those words from the Book of Revelations, Bradshaw later recalled, It wasnt his voice that spoke them. It was not Pastor Osteen speaking. The sound of that voice reverberated through the stadium. For as long as I live, Ill never forget it.\nParamedics arrived at Lakewood Church at 8:05 P.M. and treated Osteen on the scene. The pastor suffered a mild concussion brought by the nearly ten foot free fall to the stage floor but was otherwise unhurt, save for some minor bruising to his forehead. A spokesman for the megachurch told Fox 26 Houston that Mr. Osteen has no memory of the events that occurred prior to regaining consciousness.\nDoctors and medical staff at the Texas Medical Center on Holcombe Boulevard in Houston were overwhelmed Saturday night as they treated approximately six hundred and fifty people, many of whom were in a state of shock after witnessing the event. Lakewood Church boasts one of the largest congregations in the United States and reaches an estimated 27 million people worldwide each week. In 1999, Joel Osteen replaced his father, John Osteen, who founded the church in 1959, as Senior Pastor.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Lakewood's Senior Pastor, Joel Osteen reportedly levitated nearly ten feet above the stage following the conclusion of his sermon."}

The Virginia Department of Transportation has approved a $491.5 million plan to install bicycle-friendly lanes along portions of I-495 and I-95 in Northern Virginia and parts of the Washington metropolitan area, a spokesperson for VDOT announced on Tuesday.\nThe fact of the matter is that we as a society are becoming increasingly eco-conscious and passionate about preserving our environment and as a result, more and more people are seeking out non-motorized transportation as a means of travel, Ned Meeks, the projects lead developer, told the Washington Business Journal. Right now, we have no real means of streamlining long-distance travel for the tens of thousands of people who rely on bicycles as their primary mode of transportation.\nAn avid cyclist and Share the Road advocate, Meeks vision for the Capital Beltway will become a reality in the coming months. At a cost to taxpayers of less than half a billion dollars, the project will involve expanding portions of the Beltway to allow for a 1.5 meter-wide path between the outside lane and shoulder where cyclists can travel at high speeds alongside the flow of motor vehicle traffic.\nIn an effort to remain below the already steep budget, Meeks said developers decided to scrap the more aesthetic features of the bike lane such as a protective barrier that would serve to separate cyclists from the highway. Generally speaking, this is something that youre more likely to see in an urban environment, Meeks said, continuing, From the beginning we approached this project from a minimalist viewpoint. You arent going to see a lot of unnecessary elements like illumination lights, protective barriers, or rest areas. This is purely a means of long distance rapid transportation.\nVDOT officials say construction for the Capital Beltway bike lane is set to commence on February 6th. Commuters should expect delays and exercise caution, particularly while driving along the highways twenty-two mile stretch in Northern Virginia where construction crews will be present day and night expanding the road and laying down paint.\nWhile the project is only expected to take about a month to complete, Meeks said his mission is far from over. The two-time triathlon winner turned visionary developer hopes more states will adopt similar high-speed bike lanes along their highways.In order to fully embrace this idea that bicyclists and motorists can share the road together, the biking community must have access to all roads  regardless of size and traffic flow, Meeks argued. Otherwise, the quest for transportation equality will never be achieved.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "FALLS CHURCH, Va. - The Virginia Department of Transportation has approved a $491.5 million plan to install bicycle-friendly lanes along portions of I-495.."}

President Barack Obama will exercise his presidential powers this week when he signs an executive order directing the Supreme Court to indefinitely suspend the 22nd Amendment. Coming on the heels of the Conservative Political Action Conference held at Marylands National Harbor, President Obama announced his decision to temporarily end presidential term limits, saying, Im not seeing any potential presidential candidates on either side of the aisle who are capable of carrying out the task of running the country.\nCiting poor performance on the part of a Republican-controlled congress, the struggling economy, and the continuing situation with ISIS, Obama said he feels obligated to continue his term in order to steer the country away from crisis just like Roosevelt.\nThis is not something out of the ordinary, says political analyst Elliot Stabler. We already have several states with no gubernatorial term limits. Connecticut, Idaho, Massachusetts, Washington, Vermont, New York, just to name a few. In fact Michael Bloomberg repealed term limits in order to run for a third time as New York City mayor.\nIn addition Mr. Obama has ordered the National Guard to remain on standby in the months leading up to and during his third term. He will issue a second executive order authorizing the Department of Justice to temporarily suspend Habeas Corpus in the event a state of emergency is declared due to opposition to his decision to continue the presidency.\nThe Twenty-second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution was ratified on February 27th, 1951 and sets a limit of two four-year terms for the office of the President of the United States. Since ratification there have been several unsuccessful attempts to repeal the 22nd Amendment.

However, I dont think the answer is to continue stonewalling the inevitable. The president, who previously expressed support for the demonstrations, called the pipeline an important and necessary part of American infrastructure, saying, This is something that will enhance and strengthen our nation for generations to come.\nThe writ of habeas corpus, which grants prisoners or detainees the right to challenge the legality of their imprisonment, is covered in the Suspension Clause of the U.S. Constitution under Article One and, as such, shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\nFor federal authorities in North Dakota, the writs suspension allows for far greater powers in terms of arrest and detainment of protesters, journalists, and other disruptive individuals. Whether they admit it or not, a lot of these people who have presented themselves as reporters are actively taking steps to impede the construction of this pipeline, said Major General Arnold Dohlmann of the North Dakota Army National Guard. Backed by force of fifteen hundred seasoned soldiers, Maj, Gen. Dohlmann is set to assume command of law enforcement operations in Morton County immediately following President Obamas suspension of habeas corpus on Monday.\nAs it stands, my orders are to detain anyone suspected of interfering with the continued efforts by Energy Transfer Partners and their respective contractors to install the Dakota Access Pipeline. Further, Ive received authorization from the White House to hold these individuals until construction of the pipeline is completed. Maj. Gen. Dohlmann said the Army National Guard is in the process of erecting two temporary internment facilities on the outskirts of Morton County where detainees will be held pending the pipelines completion. Citing the need for operational security, Dohlmann declined to specify the exact location of the internment facilities.\nThe decision by the Obama administration comes at a time when clashes between demonstrators and local authorities have reached an all-time high.

They believe theyre doing the Lords work, Pope Francis said. But the Devil is a master of deceit. The actions and values of Christians in America are contradictory in nearly every aspect to the teachings of Jesus Christ.\nUsing Americas insatiable obsession with violence as an example, PopeFrancis said the U.S. is helping facilitate thedevils goal of establishing hell on earth.

President-elect Donald J. Trump received backlash from Democrats and members of the intelligence community on Thursday when it came to light that he engaged in a ninety-minute Skype video session last weekend with North Koreas Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Trump described the unprecedented discussion  which critics have called a clear violation of U.S. protocol  as extraordinary, saying the North Korean dictator appeared to be in very good health.\nWe had a wonderful conversation, the former reality TV star said of Kim. Hes very different from the way hes portrayed by the media and, you know, thats something I can relate to. Trump said he was surprised by exactly how much he and the Supreme Leader have in common.

I said You ought to come to New York, Ill give you the best meatloaf youve ever had in your life.\nAside from sharing a love of baked ground meat, Trump and his North Korean counterpart discussed a wide range of issues including the economy, nuclear proliferation, and the reunification of North and South Korea. Trump, who repeatedly made the assertion during his campaign that more countries should have nuclear weapons, said he was willing to look into the possibility of loosening certain sanctions against the North Korean regime that might hinder the progress of its nuclear program.

During a high-profile visit to the United States this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed members of the pro-Israel lobby, imploring them to foster support among Congress to relocate the Palestinian people to the state of Wyoming. In doing so, Netanyahu told a packed ballroom, the move would serve to strengthen U.S.-Israeli relations while significantly reducing tensions between Israel and its neighbors.\nAccording to Netanyahu, the plan to move approximately 6.08 million Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank could be accomplished in under three years, with Palestinians making the journey aboard chartered container ships, dramatically reducing transportation costs for U.S. taxpayers. In the meantime, Israel would continue to expand its settlements into previously occupied areas.\nIsrael has always enjoyed the support and friendship of the United States, Netanyahu said. However, true friends support each other in times of need. Should the United States fail to assist us in the relocation process, it would put an irreversible rift on U.S.-Israeli relations and jeopardize the safety and security of the Jewish State. The prime minister added that should the U.S. neglect to act, it would show an unequivocal lack of commitment to the Mideast peace process.\nThis reporter spoke with Herschel Krustovski, a representative of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, who has been working with officials from the Israeli government to lay the groundwork for the relocation process. We found Wyoming to be the best possible location for a number of reasons. First, it is sparsely populated; second, despite the climate not being that of the Middle East, the terrain bears a striking resemblance to Israel. We feel that will help the Palestinian people during the adjustment process.\nWyoming state legislature seemed optimistic about the economic value a Palestinian relocation would bring. Republican State Senator John Marston, who attended this weeks policy conference at AIPAC and met privately with Netanyahu, said, Were all in agreement that not only does this move benefit Israel, but also the great state of Wyoming. We have a rich history of agriculture and mineral production in our state and the influx of the Palestinian people would provide a significant boost in our economy that I believe would benefit the entire nation.\nShould the United States decide to accept the Palestinian people, Senator Marston says Wyoming will welcome them with open arms. Ive already spoken with members of our state legislature and were preparing to pass legislation that will allow us to combine Weston, Niobrara, and Goshen counties into one, thereby creating a suitable home for the Palestinian people.\nThe central purpose of Prime Minister Netanyahus trip to the United States this week was a scheduled appearance before Congress meant to dissuade American involvement in a proposed U.S.-Iran nuclear deal.

MacCallum noted that of the 37% in favor, a startling 16% said they would strongly prefer a repressive monarchy under Obama over a constitutional republic under Trump.\nFurther, a large fraction of American voters said theyd be willing to sacrifice certain basic freedoms and rights in order to support an Obama monarchy. Of the options provided, 57% favored relinquishing at least half of their annual income to the monarchy. Meanwhile, 25% of those surveyed said they could do without the right to own firearms if it would please the monarchy and 18% would be willing to give up their right to own land.\nThe poll, which surveyed 1,039 randomly selected registered voters nationwide, suggests that many Americans are fed up with politics as usual in the United States. If weve learned anything from this election, its that people are sick of the status quo, saidBreitbart News Networks chief political analyst Dr. Elliot Stabler. My only concern here is that a monarchy could hinder the spread of nationalism in this country.\nOverall, 92% of those in favor of a monarchy-style government said they were confident Barack Obama would be a fair and just monarch rather than one who is aggressive and unforgiving. While 44% agreed that Mr. Obama should tap his eldest daughter, eighteen year-old Malia Ann, as his successor, more than 63% said they strongly believe fifteen year-old Sasha Obama can be groomed into one day becoming a powerful and influential ruler.", "section": "Politics", "content_type": "article", "desc": "A new Fox News poll conducted during President Barack Obama's farewell address shows that nearly 37% of American voters would adhere to a monarchy under Mr."}

According to a new report scheduled for public release this weekby the Government Accountability Office, President Obamas bathroom breaks may have cost U.S. taxpayers just over $4 billion in 2015. Data provided to the GAO by the Obama administration shows that on average, President Barack Obama took 3.5 bathroom breaks a day last year, with each trip to the toilet lasting four minutes or less.\nBy the GAOs estimate, the commander-in-chief spent just over eighty-five hours in the bathroom in 2015 alone. The question on everyones mind when they look at a report like this is, What exactly is he doing in there?' Wondered Republican senator John McCain. The former POW admitted toC-SPAN that he goes to the bathroom about once a day on a good day.\nEven so, the Arizona senator cited a particularly disturbing quote from the report stating that on October 23rd, the day former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was scheduled to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, President Obama took a record-breaking twenty-one minute bathroom break. I think its very telling, Senator McCain said.\nThe average adult male uses the restroom anywhere from three times a day to once every three days, said Dr. Deepak Gupta, a senior scatologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. Ideally we see about one ounce of stool per every twelve pounds of body weight, Dr. Gupta explained, continuing, With that said, President Obama -who weighs about one hundred eighty pounds, should produce about fifteen ounces of solid fecal matter per bowel movement.\nHowever, Dr. Gupta pointed out that due to unusually high levels of stress associated with the job of running the country, President Obama likely produces well below average stools. In all probability, the guy is a stool softener addict, Dr. Gupta toldReal News Right Now.\nDespite President Obamas low performance rating in the bathroom, the GAO estimates he still uses an above-average amount of toilet paper and -if hes a courtesy flusher, as White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest once hinted, he uses at least twice as much water per visit to the mens room as the average American. This, coupled with the obvious breaks in productivity, has cost taxpayers a whopping $4.1 billion.\nThis is simply unacceptable, Florida senator and GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio told Real News Right Now. This is the kind of imprudent overzealous spending that I intend to do away with. Senator Rubio said he and other Republican congressmen -in an effort to save taxpayers a buck or two, often wear adult diapers while on Capitol Hill. Its uncomfortable but from a moral standpoint, its the right thing to do.

Calling it the largest in recorded history, Johansen said the ejection, a tremendous eruption of gas and magnetic energy, was immediately followed by the release of a massive solar flare. This will directly impact earth in less than seventy-two hours, Johansen said. We are facing an extinction-level event.\nNASA is working in conjunction with several foreign space agencies, including those in China and Russia, to determine the exact point of impact. Because of the sheer size of this enormous mass of energy, were dealing with an extraordinarily large impact zone ranging anywhere between four and five thousand miles, said Dr. Kenneth Parcell, who heads NASAs Space Weather Prediction Center. At this time all we know is that it will impact earth somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere approximately twenty-one hundred miles north of the Equator.\nBy NASAs own estimate, six of the earths seven continents are at risk of taking a direct hit. Solar flares have the ability to disrupt communication systems and its something that happens fairly often in our solar system, said Dr. Parcell. However, coupled with a coronal mass ejection, its a One-Two punch, its going to incinerate everything in its path.\nBoth NASA and the Russian Federal Space Agency have confirmed that the Southern Hemisphere is unlikely to sustain a direct hit but warned that regions in close proximity to the impact area face the exponential risk of earthquakes, tsunamis, and nuclear fallout.

The RTA-PDW can be easily assembled in a high-stress situation, even by an inexperienced operator, in under eight minutes, Sorenson explained, adding that every product, including the RTA-PDW, comes packaged with user-friendly assembly instructions in twelve languages, including English, French, Arabic, and Chinese. At IKEA we believe in providing quality products at an affordable price, Sorenson said before demonstrating the RTA-PDWs burst-fire capabilities on a practice dummy.\nThis reporter spoke with Lieutenant General Khurshid Rasheed of the Iraqi Armys 9th Armoured Division. Iraqs Ministry of Defence recently purchased some fifty Ready-to-Assemble T-3 Mobile Anti-Aircraft Systems from IKEA for use in their fight against the Islamic State. At a cost of less than a third of other systems, such as the Patriot Air and Missile Defense System manufactured by American defense contractor Raytheon, the T-3 performs just as well, if not better, according to General Rasheed, who said, It took some time to understand the instructions but my men were able to assemble two of these systems in just a few hours time. The General added that during assembly, his soldiers discovered a majority of the anti-aircraft systems were missing two or three required screws, but nonetheless performed exceptionally well during live-fire exercises.\nThe RTA T-3 Mobile Anti-Aircraft System and other similar products are only available for purchase online or through IKEAs corporate office.

In light of recent events, we take even the smallest threat to our officers very seriously, the detective said, adding that authorities are questioning the suspects close friends and relatives in an attempt to determine if and when any of these military-aged youth were radicalized.\nIn a joint statement issued Wednesday with Cleveland officials, a spokesman for the FBI said the groups leadershipare no longer a threat to the community and any future attempts to occupy the Anthony J.

An attack of this kind is unprecedented in sheer size, Dr. Greg Burke told reporters Wednesday morning. Dr. Burke, who was appointed in 2015 by Pope Francis to serve as Deputy Director of the Press Office, said the breach was discovered last week by network security administrators who were performing a series of routine maintenance tasks.\nIt will take months for us to fully realize the impact of this loss, Dr. Burke said. Still, the Vaticans initial estimates show the hackers were able to breach its networks firewalls in a matter of minutes before making off with approximately 450,000 terabytes of data including information on more than twenty billion confessions. Mr. Burke called the incident an unholy breach, saying he feared the repercussions could last for decades.\nWhile the Seal of the Confessional prevents Catholic priests from disclosing what they learn from worshipers during a confession, the Vatican routinely collects metadata obtained during the sacred process. The type of metadata we collect includes the age, sex, race, and geographical location of the individual as well as the type of confession being made, explained Father Julio Francisco, who oversees bulk metadata collection operations for the Vatican.\nWe use this information to determine which sins require the most attention, Father Francisco said. The Papacy then advises church leaders around the world to specifically address these sins during the Mass Intentions. In addition to gathering metadata on nearly one-third of the earths population, the Vaticans bulk metadata collection program also helps the Church keep track of which countries log the most transgressions annually. Citing a need for confidentiality, Father Francisco declined to comment on the content of the data but said he believes whoever stole the information will likely try to sell it or, at the very least, leak it online.\nWhile news of the Vaticans ongoing metadata collection program may come as a surprise to some, Vatican spokesperson Dr. Greg Burke says its nothing new.

Im pleased to announce the United States has entered into a historic agreement with Islamic State that will prevent any future attacks within our country, President Obama said.\nBeginning December 24th, in commemoration of the birth of Prophet Muhammad, our armed forces, acting on my command, will assist the Islamic State in spreading the Caliphate throughout the Middle East and western Europe, President Obama said.

If you attempt to dodge the draft, Admiral Weathers warned, you will be designated an enemy combatant and forfeit your rights as a citizen of this country and those entitled to you under the Geneva Conventions.\nOn the domestic front, President Obama has authorized Congress to reallocate funds meant for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the newly created Islamic Assimilation Agency (IAA) which will oversee the construction and operation of 1,305 state-of-the-art mosques throughout the United States. Weve elected to open a minimum of three per congressional district, the president said.\nIn addition, the House Committee on Ways and Means, the federal governments chief tax-writing committee, will institute a new 7% tax on goods and services beginning January 1, 2016.

Amid preparations for a large-scale military exercise in the Sea of Japan this month, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping announced that in the event Donald Trump takes office following the 2016 presidential election, both countries will launch a preemptive strike on the United States. Putin called the threat a humanitarian intervention on behalf of every nation and said Russia and China are prepared to act unilaterally in the face of opposition.\nSpeaking from the Rose Garden today, President Barack Obama condemned Russian and Chinese leadership over the threat while calling for increased diplomacy between the three countries. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu requested an emergency meeting with the U.N. Security Council and reaffirmed Israels alliance with the United States. In the event of an attack on the United States, Israel will not hesitate to use every available asset at its disposal to secure its safety and that of its allies, the prime minister said.\nA high-ranking Russian official speaking on condition of anonymity told Al-Jazeera that neither country has ruled out the possibility of using nuclear weapons against the United States. There is a scenario calling for tactical [nuclear] strikes on coastal military installations. We are working now to identify the most lucrative targets, the official said. Russia is currently in possession of an estimated 2,500 strategic nuclear weapons, with ICBMs capable of reaching targets at a distance of 14,000 kilometers. China, respectively, holds around 250 nuclear weapons in its arsenal.\nChinese President Xi said he has instructed his nations military to begin positioning a number of its intercontinental ballistic missiles within range of major metropolitan areas along the western United States. Referring to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Xi said, In 1945 the Japanese had to be stopped. Perhaps in 2017 the Americans will face a similar fate. The Chinese president said nuclear weapons should only be used as a deterrent but added, Sometimes terrible things must be done in the name of peace.\nAccording to a recent CNN/ORC poll, 22% of Iowan voters favor Donald Trump over other Republican presidential candidates. Trump, who is considered to have the best chance of winning the general election, is currently preferred over 3 to 1 on a number of issues including the economy, terrorism, and immigration.

Given to the Israelites by God himself at Mount Sinai, the Commandments include instructions for worship and list several prohibited practices.\nPope Francis said Christians around the world are faced with ever-increasing temptations brought on by the evils of modern society. The Pope said the updated Commandments reflect the changing times and include some minor rewording of the existing rules as well as the addition of two new Commandments.\nThe Fourth Commandment, which advocates that proper respect be shown towards ones parents, has been reworded in order to include children raised by same-sex parents. Pope Francis said the Seventh Commandment, prohibiting adultery and, among other things, homosexuality, has been removed entirely, as instructed by God, in order to extend Gods grace to all His children.\nAddressing the inclusion of the new Commandments, which bring the total number to eleven, Pope Francis praised the rapid growth of technology in the digital age but said progress comes at a price. The new Fifth Commandment, which replaces the prohibition of adultery, forbids all aspects of genetic engineering and bans the consumption of genetically modified foods.\nLastly, the Eleventh Commandment disallows personal idolization and the glorification of ones self over God. Using the Kardashians, a highly publicized celebrity family, as an example, Pope Francis said, Selfies are an abomination in the eyes of our Lord.\nA spokesman for the Vatican, Father Federico Lombardi, said the Eleven Commandments are currently being etched into marble by an Italian sculptor and, upon completion, will be unveiled to the world in Saint Peters Square following an internationally televised mass.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Pope Francis announced to Christians around the world that God had instructed him to \"rewrite the Ten Commandments.\""}

Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters on the steps of the Capitol Building following the vote. The people of Washington, D.C. are finally able to have their voice heard.\nHistorically, Washington, D.C. was a federal district, rather than a state, and thus fell under jurisdiction of Congress which, until Friday, held total control over the citys local affairs. Apart from a delegate with no ability to vote on the House floor, D.C. residents were the only Americans with no representation in Congress.\nEffective January 1, 2016, D.C.s roughly 658,000 inhabitants will, for the first time in American history, be granted that right as they become residents of the Commonwealth of Virginia. Washington, D.C. is and always will be the nations capital, Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.\nThe border expansion comes as a big win for Virginia, which is expected to reap huge economic rewards with the introduction of the federal government inside its borders. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan called the legislation unconstitutional and said Maryland, with the support of Massachusetts, Wyoming, Montana, and Texas, will appeal the decision. This was a hastily made and, quite frankly, idiotic move on the part of Congress, Governor Hogan said. At no point did Congress consider the economical and political implications this has on Maryland, or the rest of the country for that matter.\nMeanwhile, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe praised the decision, telling D.C. residents, Virginia welcomes you with open arms. Although D.C. will remain the U.S. capital, starting January 1st, it will be susceptible to Virginia law. That means Initiative 71, which allows for the limited possession and cultivation of marijuana, will no longer apply. Further, residents of the District will be allowed to purchase high capacity magazines and assault weapons, which are legal to own under Virginia law.\nPresident Obama, speaking from the Rose Garden Friday, applauded the decision, calling the vote a step in the right direction.

At least twenty-six people were hospitalized last month following a brawl between Boston police and Massachusetts State Troopers outside of a Whole Foods in downtown Boston. Witnesses say at least two officers with the Boston Police Department accosted a State Trooper as he exited the Whole Foods on Cambridge Street. One officer allegedly told the trooper, Go back to f****** Framingham, you c***, before ripping the troopers groceries from his hands and hurling them into the street.\nShoppers and Whole Foods employees watched in horror as the two officers began beating and kicking the trooper, all the while screaming obscenities at him, until he collapsed on the pavement. Miraculously, the trooper was able to call for backup before losing consciousness. Massachusetts State Troopers attempted to defuse the situation but were overwhelmed when a Boston Police Special Operations Unit arrived on scene and began firing rubber bullets and tear gas in the direction of the troopers. In all, seven troopers and nineteen bystanders were treated by paramedics for non-life threatening injuries.\nOver the last decade weve witnessed the rise of a disturbing and often unreported trend in the law enforcement community, said Dr. Carl Gapinski, a former LAPD detective and criminologist. These encounters are happening all over the country but are most prevalent in departments that have received military-grade weapons and hardware from the Pentagon. Dr. Gapinski said a variety of factors contribute to the surge in police violence but available data suggests jurisdiction disputes or turf wars are the primary cause.\nJust outside the nations capital, in April of this year, two Fairfax County police officers shot and killed an Arlington County police detective after he initiated a traffic stop less than a quarter of a mile outside of his jurisdiction. Following light media attention, both officers were immediately placed on paid leave, however no charges were filed and one officer was later promoted.\nIn another incident, this time in Florida, a Coral Gables SWAT team carried out what authorities later described as a late-night no-knock drug raid on a rival police department four days after losing a state-funded softball tournament. During the raid, Coral Gables police utilized a Mine-Resistant Armored Personnel vehicle (MRAP) to breach the rival departments main entrance before firing tear gas and stun grenades into the building using Department of Defense-issued shoulder-fired grenade launchers.\nThis militarized mindset coupled with high testosterone levels creates a dangerous environment that, as weve seen time and time again, can easily escalate beyond the walls of the department, said former FBI Special Agent Ricardo Gutierrez. According to the FBIs 2014 Uniform Crime Report, nearly 1 in 10 American police officers engaged in some form of aggressive action against officers from another department that year. As more and more police departments across the United States begin to embrace a militarized version of law enforcement, Gutierrez said, those numbers will continue to grow.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Many U.S. Cities are reporting a surge in violence within the law enforcement community."}

Fans of the series were ecstatic upon learning of the books release, as it was originally intended to only appear on stage.\nDebuting on Harry Potters birthday (July 30th for the uninformed) at the Palace Theatre in London, the play acts as a sequel to Rowlings seventh book. Unlike its predecessors, the play is a result of a creative collaboration between J.K. Rowling, playwright Jack Thorne, and director John Tiffany.\nSet nineteen years in the future, the plot revolves around the life of Harry Potter -now a working-class family man, and has, according to producers, an underlying theme that touches on the inherent dangers surrounding the global climate change crisis. The play serves to make a strong case for the dire need to end our dependency on fossil fuels, said cast member Paul Thornley, who plays an adult version of Ron in The Cursed Child.\nThe storys antagonist, whose identity has yet to be revealed, has harnessed the immense power of fossil fuels and greenhouse gasses and threatens to destroy the Muggle world -and Harrys legacy, once and for all. Its up to Harry to learn how to combine his advanced wizardry with clean energy to save not only himself, but everyone he holds dear, explained Rowling. Meanwhile, the fate of humanity hangs in the balance.\nSince Rowlings 1997 release of the first book in the series, titledHarry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, the books have sold more than 450 million copies worldwide.In addition to being the best-selling series in world history,the four most recentHarry Potter books broke records for the fastest-selling books in recorded history withHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows sellingnearly 11 million copies within twenty-four hours of its release in the United States alone.", "section": "Entertainment", "content_type": "article", "desc": "J.K.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected an invitation from France on Monday to take part in a Middle East peace conference held in Paris later this year, saying his country has already made arrangements to relocate more than one million Palestinians to a vacant 700,000 square-mile floating trash vortex known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\nThe Palestinian people are rejoicing in the streets. Their suffering has ended and they finally have a place to call their homeland, Prime Minister Netanyahu proudly told theJerusalem Post. Netanyahu described the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, which is located roughly 10,398 miles west of the Jordan River in the North Pacific Ocean, as a tropical paradise untouched by man where marine life is abundant and bountiful.\nThose in the Palestinian Authority whom I have spoken with all agree that this arrangement is the closest we will ever come to the original UN proposal of a two-state solution, Netanyahu said. The prime minister added that the Israeli navy has already begun making preparations to relocate the first two hundred fifty thousand Palestinians from their homes in the Gaza Strip and West Bank to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\nIDF spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Baum told CNNs Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that Israel has no plans to extend its ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip to the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. You heard it right, Wolf, proclaimed the charismatic lieutenant colonel. Palestinians young and old will have the right to own notebooks and writing implements; theyll be able to enjoy a bag of potato chips, fresh meat, and even chocolate without having to worry about a late night visit from the Shin Bet.\nThe historic announcement of a full-scale Palestinian resettlement comes at an opportune time for Israel. The tiny Jewish nation is preparing to generously expand its territory with the addition of 181 new settlements in East Jerusalem. Since annexing the West Bank during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, Israel has built more than 230 settlements housing nearly half a million Jewish settlers in the occupied Palestinian territory  an initiative the United Nations Security Council has branded a violation of international law.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected an invitation from France on Monday to take part in a Middle East peace conference held in Paris..."}

He was always on edge; he would snap at the smallest infraction. The younger Durst began distancing himself from his father shortly before the start of his musical career. Around the time we started putting together a track list for Significant Other, I decided to put down some lyrics about my father, kind of through his eyes, Durst says. We ended up calling it Break Stuff.\nThe song, which contains lyrics like,first one to complain, leaves with a blood stain, and,I hope you know I pack a chainsaw, Ill skin your a** raw, serves as an ominous forewarning for things to come. In 2003, Robert Durst admitted to killing his elderly neighbor, Morris Black, during a confrontation. He went on to use a pairing knife, an axe, and two saws to dismember the body, after which, he dumped Blacks remains in Galveston Bay. A Texas jury would later acquit him of murder.\nFollowing its release in 1999, Limp Bizkits second studio album, Significant Other, ranked Number 1 on The Billboard 200, Top Canadian Albums, and Top Internet Albums.

During an exclusive interview with George Stephanopoulos on Good Morning America, Academy Award-winning actor and producer Jamie Foxx revealed shocking new details about his personal life today. Initially appearing on GMA to promote his upcoming film Sleepless Nights, Foxx deviated from the topic, saying he wanted to discuss a personal matter. Taking a more serious tone, Foxx said, George, Im white.\nFoxx, who was born and raised in Terrell, Texas, said his real name is James Robert Moreland. Folks used to call me Jim Bob,' the actor recalled. Growing up in Terrell, I always felt like a black man living inside a white mans body. Early on, Foxx said he struggled to find suitable roles that fit his identity. Eventually, he said, I realized I was meant to act in black roles. With the help of Willie Beamen, a childhood friend and makeup artist, Foxx landed a spot on In Living Color in the early 1990s.\nIt was a defining moment for me, Foxx told Stephanopoulos. Not just as an actor but on a personal level, too. In 1998, Foxx traveled to Switzerland where he underwent transracial surgery to become an African American. Afterwards I knew Id made the right decision. Since then, the Grammy award-winning actor and rapper has enjoyed an ever successful career in the entertainment industry.\nFoxx, who won an Academy Award in 2004 for Best Actor after his stunning portrayal of Ray Charles in the movie Ray, told George Stephanopoulos what led him to come forward. I was incredibly moved by Rachel Dolezal and the courage she showed in admitting her heritage, Foxx said, adding, Shes an inspiration to the transracial community.\nFoxx told Stephanopoulos hes established a Kickstarter campaign in order to raise money to pay for a transracial operation for Rachel Dolezal, should she want it. Ive already contributed $10,000 to it, Foxx said. Stephanopoulos, visibly moved by what he described as Foxxs compassion and humility, pledged to match the African American actors contribution with a donation of his own.\nRachel Dolezal, former president of Spokane, Washingtons NAACP chapter, made headlines last week when her estranged parents publicly outed her as being white. Ms. Dolezal, who is, in fact, white, has refuted these claims, going as far as saying there is no biological proof tying her to her parents.

Russias internal intelligence agency, otherwise known as the Federal Security Service (FSB), has detained nine American men that were found to be in possession of suspicious materials after they illegally gained access to a former Soviet nuclear test site in northeastern Kazakhstan.\nIt was their intention to use [the] materials to manufacture a dirty bomb, Yuri Ivanov, the ranking agent in charge of the investigation, toldThe Moscow Times on Friday. Russian authorities waited until the suspects had cleared security at Sochi International Airport and were preparing to board a direct flight to the United States before quickly moving in to secure the hazardous materials.\nIn early May, the FSB intercepted a series of communications that had been shared between two Twitter accounts located in the Midwestern United States. According to Ivanov, the cryptic messages prompted the FSB to launch an operation in conjunction with the Arystan, an anti-terror unit affiliated with the National Security Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan, meant to monitor and track the suspects movements upon their arrival in the former Soviet republic.\nUsing cell site simulation technology, the FSB tracked the Americans to the Semipalatinsk Test Site located on the steppe in northeast Kazakhstan where they later observed the conspirators, some of whom were carrying Gieger counters, gather irradiated debris into several large backpacks.\nUnder intensive questioning by Russian intelligence agents, several of the suspects declared they were affiliated with the American Gamergatemovement and admitted they had conspired to carry out a series of high profile attacks in the United States aimed at eradicating women from the video game industry.\nThe suspects, all of whom are in their early thirties, exhibited a strong distrust toward two female FSB officers who were involved in the interrogation. They refused to even speak until they were certain the women were gone, Ivanov said, adding that a number of the American men accused their FSB interrogators of being SJWs, or social justice warriors. It was all very strange, Ivanov remarked.\nIn a show of good faith, the Russian government has since turned all but one of the suspects  who reportedly died during questioning  over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. counterpart to the FSB.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "MOSCOW, Ru. - Russia's internal intelligence agency, otherwise known as the Federal Security Service (FSB), has detained nine American men that were found.."}

Pope Francis said Vatican Citys modest army, known as the Pontifical Swiss Guard, detonated three thermonuclear warheads in a reef located one hundred miles south of the tropical island this week.\nA spokesman for the Vatican, Father Federico Lombardi, said the tests were carried out by an elite unit within the Swiss Guard and added that the Catholic Churchs stance on nuclear disarmament remains the same. The position of the Holy See is that these weapons must only be used as a deterrent against evil, Father Lombardi said.\nWith a population of 842, Vatican City is the smallest internationally recognized city-state in the world. The Pontifical Swiss Guard, a small security force made up of Swiss army personnel, serves as the de facto military of Vatican City. The entire force consists of just over 110 soldiers and is primarily responsible for protecting the Pope and the Apostolic Palace.\nThe Vaticans admission that it conducted a nuclear weapons test makes it the tenth nation to possess such weapons. As to exactly how many weapons the Vatican has in its possession, as well as where it is keeping them, remains a mystery. Vatican City is only about one hundred and nine acres, CNN Military Analyst Peter Mansoor said. Its hard to imagine theyd have room to store a warhead, let alone multiple ICBM platforms.\nIt remains unclear as to how the Vatican and the Swiss Guard were able to produce a nuclear weapon in the first place, but experts, including Mansoor, believe the city-state may have had help. They definitely had some sort of assistance.

This is only the beginning, said Chinas Premier Li Keqiang. In one months time we will hold elections to replace the current government in Athens.

A North Carolina man is facing a slew of charges including felony child abuse and resisting arrest after he allegedly violated the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act by bringing his two year-old daughter into a mens restroom at Northlake Mall last weekend where authorities say he planned to change her diaper.\nAccording to a criminal complaint filed Monday morning at the Mecklenberg County Superior Court, on April 29, officers with the Charlotte-Mecklenberg Police Department observed thirty-two year-old Jacob Schmidt, who, at the time, was carrying his two year-old daughter, enter the mens public restroom near Dicks Sporting Goods.\nThe officers immediately followed Schmidt into the clearly marked mens bathroom where they confronted him as he attempted to enter a stall meant for the physically handicapped. As one officer worked to safely evacuate other patrons from the restroom, the other asked to see the childs birth certificate. According to court documents, Schmidt immediately became defensive, telling the officer, I need to change my daughters diaper.\nMr. Schmidt was carrying a Dora the Explorer-themed canvas tote bag over his left shoulder which he began to reach for in a threatening manner, according to CMPD chief of police Courtney Bradshaw, who spoke to reporters Monday afternoon. Our officers acted quickly, using a Taser to subdue the suspect, Bradshaw said.\nOnce the suspect had been taken into custody, officers performed a field test to determine the two year-old childs sex. Once it was determined that the child was in fact a female, Mr. Schmidt was read his rights and formally charged with criminal trespass, endangering the welfare of a minor, and resisting arrest, Chief Bradshaw said, adding that Schmidt showed zero remorse for his crimes.\nThis man is sick, said Assistant District Attorney Angela Hanefeld. Jacob Schmidt is a pervert who poses a grave threat to society and should never have been allowed near a child in the first place. Mrs. Hanefeld said Schmidts two year-old daughter, whose identity is being kept secret for her safety, has been turned over to Child Protective Services while she awaits foster care. Its a very sad situation, said Hanefeld.

In a sign of good faith, Cuban president Raul Castro on Friday agreed to turn three Russian-made nuclear warheads that his country has possessed since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis over to the United States. President Castro, who called the warheads a gift from Moscow, said they have been collecting dust on a launch pad aboard three long-range rockets which have been pointed at Washington, D.C. for more than four decades.\nPresident Castro said the outdated Cold War relics have served as a makeshift monument to a periodwhen tensions between the U.S. and Cuba were at an all-time high. Now, the nuclear armed missiles sit nestled among a trio of jagey trees on the outskirts of one of Havanas many schoolyards. They are like a radioactive jungle gym, joked Javiero Casteneda who serves as the groundskeeper for the secondary school where the warheads are located.\nCubas decision to turn the twenty-megaton warheads over to the U.S. is being viewed by some American lawmakers as an attempt to ease tensions between the two countries, particularly as the United States begins to consider the possibility of returning the naval base at Guantanamo Bay back over to Cuba.\nThe biggest issue on the table right now is whether the Cuban government intends to house its political prisoners alongside the current detainees at Guantanamo or if they plan to expand the facility to include a separate block all together, Air Force Brigadier General Jose Monteagudo, commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo, told The Washington Post. Its our hope that the Cuban government will continue to show the detainees the same level of humanity afforded to them by the United States, the brigadier general said.\nPresident Barack Obama, who visited Cuba last week as the first American president to do so in nearly eighty years, called the decision to turn the warheads over a step in the right direction but said the tiny tropical nation still has a long way to go before it sheds its authoritarian roots.

In an exclusive interview appearing in next months issue of Inspire Magazine, al Qaedas supreme commander, Ayman al-Zawahiri, sits down with Real News Right Now to discuss a variety of topics including his startling decision toleaveal Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for the Islamic State.\nal-Zawahiri: The organization suffered a bit after Osama disappeared. We had a brief internal power struggle that didnt receive much attention in the western media. There were some executions here and there but these things have a funny way of working themselves out.\nThe whole ordeal left me with a bitter taste in my mouth and I started questioning my role as Emir of al-Qaeda. Can you believe Ive been doing this for thirty-five years now? Lets be honest, 9/11 was a huge success but even that took us over twenty years to pull off.\nIve heard a lot of brothers say, Al-Qaeda is so 2001, and I always respond by having their families executed but, you know what? Theyre right. Al-Qaeda needs a serious makeover if its going to survive twenty-first century jihad.\nal-Zawahiri: No. [pauses to light cigarette] Im a surgeon. Organization isnt my strong suit; I have people who do that for me. Honestly I always imagined at this point in my life Id be an imam in some cushy mosque in London, sipping tea and nibbling on biscuits while occasionally selling some teenager on the idea of jihad. Not roasting like a lamb under thelight of this [REDACTED] sun.\nal-Zawahiri: See, its not an Islamic state, its The Islamic State. Lets face it, you cant compete with these guys. Theyve got high-definition videos featuring young, tanned, and chiseled Arab men riding around in pickup trucks with Kalashnikovs -beheadings and explosions going offleft and right. How do you say it in America? If you cant beat em, join em.\nal-Zawahiri: I used to tell Mohammed Atta, You ought to smile more; you always look like you just came from your mothers execution. Between you and me, his personality, or lack thereof, was key in deciding his role in the plane operation. Just get this guy outta here!, we said. [chuckles]\nal-Zawahiri:I have a veryparticular set of skills. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. [laughing] Im sorry, I said the exact same thing to al-Baghdadi during our first meeting and he hadthe same look on his face.\nBut I digress. [pauseswhile lighting cigarette]As it happens, Ill be assuming the dutiesof a brother who just the other day fell victim to American bombs. This brother wasknownto theWest as Jihadi John.And so, due to his untimely passing coupled with my extensive experience as a medical practitioner, Ive been asked to chair the Islamic States prestigious department of interrogation and execution.\nAs you can imagine, Im very excited about the opportunity to really put my skills to the test.

The twenty-one year-old Ohio native joined a jailhouse tap dance troupe at the urging of his cellmate and, within weeks, became the talk of the cell block. That honky fish got moves, Brocks cellmate, who asked to be referred to by his street name Pinky Stickerz, told TMZ.\nDue to the unfavorable circumstances surrounding his conviction, the terms of Turners probation forbid him from coming within fifteen feet of the opposite sex.

Kanye West and Taylor Swift are at it again. The latest spat between the two comes on the heels of last Thursdays scuffle, which began during the launch party for his latest album, The Life of Pablo, when Kanye dropped a verse from the track Famous,in which he insinuates Taylor Swift ought to have sex with him because he made her famous.\nAs expected, Ms. Swift did not take kindly to being name-dropped. She promptly issued a strongly worded statement through her publicist condemning Mr. Wests actions and accusing him of promoting misogyny. Later, Swifts brother uploaded a video to Instagram that depicted him throwing a pair of Yeezeys -a brand of designer shoes created by Mr. West, into a garbage bin.\nAs if that werent enough, shortly after 4 p.m. Saturday evening -according to West and the Los Angeles Police Department, two teams of twelve men wearing commando gear laid siege to the West-Kardashian compound. The first team arrived mere seconds before the other and rappelled from a helicopter onto the roof of Kanye and Kims $20 million mansion. Meanwhile the second team crashed through the complexs wrought-iron gates aboard two heavily armored black Chevy Tahoes.\nSecurity footage obtained by TMZ shows the commandos smashing the second-story plate-glass windows before hurling stun grenades and tear gas into the West-Kardashian residence. Meanwhile, Kanye, who was reportedly holed up in his lavish master bedroom engaged in a three-way Skype session with Kim and Rob Kardashian, incorrectly believed the commandos were affiliated with BET. Theyre here for my Humanitarian Award! A clearly flustered Kanye is said to have told Rob, having to shout in order to make himself heard amid the sounds of incoming machine gun fire.\nIt was then, according to the Grammy-winning rapper, that heavily armed gunmen used a battering ram to break down the ornate oak doors leading into his sprawling sleeping quarters. Seconds later, Kanye told TMZ, he was pistol-whipped in the face and sent flailing backwards into his $175,000 diamond-encrusted California King bed. Meanwhile, his masked assailants hovered over him -some pointing guns in his face. One of them, whom Kanye described as being particularly menacing, thrust a satellite phone into the rappers quivering hands.\nKanye admitted he was shocked to hear none of than Taylor Swift on the other end of the satphone. She said, Kanye, enough is enough! And she hung up, recalled West. I was like, Who the f*** this b**** think she is?'

Archaeologists working at Thomas Jeffersons primary plantation, otherwise known as Monticello, have unearthed a cache of historic documents which provide a glimpse into the mind of the late Thomas Jefferson. The vast majority of the recovered documents were penned by Mr. Jefferson himself and, according to historians, are in pristine condition.\nIncluded in the discovery is a six volume leather-bound journal in which the third president of the United States kept meticulously detailed notes and diagrams of cloud formations which he observed from the roof of Monticello. In one particular entry, next to a sketch of what is likely a Cirrus cloud, Mr. Jefferson wrote that it resembled the finest and most delicate wisps of hair, the likes of which one finds dangling about a periwig.\nAnother set of documents found locked away in an iron safe beneath a store house on the grounds of Monticello known as the Negro Quarter, appear to be the minutes recorded from a series of private meetings between Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and John Adams. In the records, the Founding Fathers weigh the pros and cons of including certain aspects of Sharia Law in the final draft of the U.S. Constitution.\nJohn Adams expresses some doubts as to whether a need to include such minute details could be viewed as obtrusive by future generations of lawmakers. However, all three agree that Sharia Law should not be entirely removed from the American system of government. It is indeed the most efficient way of resolving simple domestic issues, noted Mr. Jefferson, to which Mr. Franklin wholeheartedly agreed, adding that Sharia Law should be implemented at the very least to resolve petty criminal infractions.\nOfficials at Jeffersons Monticello say the documents will be made available to the general public along with other recently discovered artifacts once archaeological analysts have had a chance to thoroughly inspect and log them.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "MONTICELLO, Va. - Archaeologists at Monticello have unearthed a cache of documents which provide a glimpse into the mind of the late Thomas Jefferson."}

DEA agents and sheriffs deputies with the Pinal County Narcotics Task Force made a startling discovery Tuesday while serving a drug warrant that ended in a botched raid. County officials say a typo on the official search warrant lead law enforcement officers to the wrong location, a warehouse in Casa Grande, where, instead of a methamphetamine operation, they found a Boeing 777 commercial airliner and a sedan.\nUpon entering the premises, Pinal County Sheriffs deputies observed a large commercial airliner parked in the center of the warehouse, Pinal Countys Chief Investigator Adam Hutch told reporters. The aircraft in question is white, with a gray underbelly and features red and blue stripes down the middle of fuselage. Hutch said the planes tail prominentlydisplays the all-too-familiar red and blue logo of Malaysian Airlines. Additionally, its registration number, 9M-MRO, matches that of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean on March 8, 2014.\nRight now we are trying to determine the origin of this aircraft, Hutch said, adding that airliner was carrying less than a quarter tank of fuel. Public records show the warehouse in question is located on privately owned land in the outskirts of Casa Grande and has been on lease to CNN since March 6, 2014. The twenty-four hour cable news channel declined a request to comment from this reporter but Ted Turner, owner of Turner Broadcasting System Inc, the parent company of CNN, told The New York Times that he found the discovery very peculiar, and added, I have no idea why that would be there.\nDuring CNNs The Situation Room Tuesday, Wolf Blitzer was pointedly asked by a guest what his thoughts on the aircraft were. Mr. Blitzer blinked several times while staring into the camera before saying, Im sorry, could you repeat that? We seem to be having some issues with the mic. Blitzer, citing technical difficulties, began to tap on his earpiece before removing it entirely to inspect it. He began to blow on the earpiece, presumably to remove dust or hardened ear wax, as the segment cut to an unusually long commercial break.\nIn addition to the Boeing 777 commercial airliner, Pinal Countys Narcotics Task Force also discovered a black BMW 328i sedan parked in the warehouse. The vehicle was found to be registered to CNN anchor Don Lemon. Authorities said the car was empty except for a spent tear gas canister stamped Ferguson Police Department which was found under the passenger seat.\nIn a statement released by his publicist, Don Lemon said hes never even been to Arizona and accused the Pinal County Sheriffs Office of racial profiling. Lemon, who drives a Toyota Prius, went on to say he wouldnt be caught dead in a vehicle reminiscent of the Third Reich.\nEarly Wednesday morning sheriffs deputies arrested CNNs Anderson Cooper as he attempted to gain access to the warehouse which has been sealed off by law enforcement pending an investigation. Deputies say Cooper arrived at the scene via helicopter at approximately 7:15 a.m. Rather than land, Cooper, who was wearing a bulletproof Press vest and wrap-around sunglasses, rappelled to the ground from the hovering helicopter. Deputies brought Cooper down with a Taser after he attempted to place a breaching charge on a door leading into the warehouse. He later told investigators he was there to set the record straight.\nOn August 2 a piece of wreckage belonging to a Boeing 777, the same type of aircraft as MH370, washed up on an island in the Indian Ocean. The object was sent to France for further analysis but Malaysian authorities are confident the wreckage belongs to the missing MH370.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "DEA agents and sheriff's deputies with the Pinal County Narcotics Task Force may have found missing MH370 while serving a drug warrant Tuesday."}

The one minute and thirty-seven second video, which authorities believe was shot using a cellphone, appears to be taken in a small, dimly lit room.\nJudging by the walls, youre seeing a lot of what appears to be grime, or even mud. This was most likely filmed in an underground bunker, former DEA Special Agent Edwardo Fuentez told CNNs Wolf Blitzer on The Situation Room. Fuentez said the bunker could be located in some of the more remote areas of Mexicos Sierra Madre mountain range.

I just want to do the right thing and get these drugs off the street, Lohan said.\nHead of the ruthless Sinaloa Cartel, Guzman was serving a twenty-year and nine month sentence for a slew of charges including murder, drug trafficking, and money laundering. He was arrested in 1993 in Guatemala before being extradited to Mexico where he was placed in federal prison. Following his first escape in 2001, he was recaptured by Mexican authorities on February 22, 2014. On July 11, 2015 he escaped again, this time by way of an underground tunnel.

The announcement comes less than a week after a gunman armed with a handgun and an assault rifle shot and killed forty-nine people and wounded fifty-three others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\nOnce enacted, the National Security and Individual Protection Act, otherwise known as E.O. 13717, will prohibit the sale or barter of firearms by licensed dealers and individual sellers to private citizens. Americans who have legally purchased firearms prior to the executive orders issue date will be permitted to keep them. Let me be clear, were not taking away anyones guns here, President Obama said on Friday. This is about keeping weapons out of the hands of dangerous people.\nThe president explained that under the new law, Americans who were once eligible to acquire firearms through legal means are still able to do so but must manufacture the weapons themselves. If you absolutely have to have a gun, I have no doubt youll find some way to build it yourself, Obama said, continuing, Its what the Founding Fathers did, its what the Minutemen did, and as a student of constitutional law, I believe there is little doubt that this iswhat they intended when they penned the Constitution.\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives director Thomas E. Brandon further explained the guidelines for manufacturing homemade firearms, saying, Prior to assembly, [individuals] must notify the BATF of their intent to manufacture such a firearm. Under the National Firearms Act you will be subjected to a mandatory $200 tax, applicable for each firearm you create, Brandon explained. This applies to even the most rudimentary rifles, pistols, and shotguns; anything that fires a projectile is subject to NFA guidelines.\nThis is quite an ingenious ploy by the Obama administration, remarked CNN political analyst Elliot Brewster. That theyve managed to pull this off without violating the Constitution in any way, shape, or form is an incredible accomplishment in and of itself. Brewster noted that President Obama has pointed out repeatedly throughout the course of his time in office that he has no intention of infringing upon the right of the American people to keep and bear arms.

Weve been lucky enough to work with a great group of people from PETA who have done their partin providing us withrescuedPocket Beaglesfrom puppy mills across the country. These animals are being given a second chance at life and the opportunity to protect our men and women in uniform.\nJudging from early reports on the ground, the rigorous training program is yielding positive results. An Army EOD unit assistingspecial operations forcesnear Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan late last year received twelve Pocket Beagles as part of a Joint Special Operations deployment package.\nSpecialoperations forceswere notified by members of the Afghan National Army of a potential roadside bomb on the outskirts of a townapproximately one kilometer from their position,Sergent Major Dickerson explained.Army EOD operators approached the site from a safe distance and deployed five Pocket Beagles.

They have the ability to get into hard-to-reach places that larger dogs struggle with, in addition topossessing above average intelligence and a keen ability to track, Campbell-Green said.

A Veterans Affairs hospital in West Texas has devised an ingenious way to deal with the exceptionally long wait times suffered by many veterans seeking healthcare. Officials at the West Texas VA Medical Center in San Angelo have erected a tent city in a vacant lot adjacent to the facility where veterans with wait times of forty-five days or more can find temporary lodging.\nPresently, were operating at about forty percent capacity, John Abrams, Director of Environmental Services at the West Texas Center, told NewsWest 9, a local NBC affiliate. Abrams, who oversees day-to-day operations at the tent city, said the lot currently hosts twenty full-size disaster relief tents on loan from FEMA. Each tent has the capacity to hold about twenty-five cots, explained Abrams during a tour of the city. Right now Ive got about half a dozen Porto-Johns around back as well as a fire hydrant that we open up once a day for showers.\nIn addition to providing free housing and running water to up to five hundred veterans in need of healthcare, Adams told NewsWest 9 that the medical center has entered into an agreement with a fleet of local food trucks. They pull up every morning at 7:45 sharp and dish out meals, Adams said, adding, In fact, a couple of these drivers are vets themselves, so occasionally theyll throw in a little extra grub or offer these guys a twenty percent discount.\nTwenty-eight year-old Reginald Williams, a former staff sergeant in the U.S. Army, has spent more than three months awaiting treatment for an infection caused by injuries he sustained to his leg during two consecutive tours in Afghanistan. This place saved my life, Williams said before going on to say that his infection had become so bad in recent weeks that a fellow soldier awaiting chemotherapy, who served as a combat medic in Iraq, performed an emergency field amputation on his leg. If it wasnt for the tent city, I would have died, a grateful Williams said.\nVeterans and staff alike at the West Texas VA Medical Center agree that the tent city has already done more than enough to help put an end to the troubled history surrounding the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Residents of the nations capital, including D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser, are protesting a recent decision by congress to install several Minuteman III silos at the Tidal Basin in downtown Washington, D.C. The District of Columbia has no need or want for a nuclear missile silo, let alone one right across from the National Mall, argued Mayor Bowser.\nHowever, congressional leaders disagree. The Tidal Basin is an ideal location for an underground launch facility, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) toldThe Washington Post. Were talking about providing total security to the entire eastern seaboard through nuclear deterrence. I simply cant fathom why anyone would oppose this.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. senate granted the Department of Defense the authorization it needs to install up to five intercontinental ballistic missile silos underneath the Tidal Basin, a man-made reservoir constructed in the 1880s which separates the Washington Channel from the Potomac River. Each silo will contain an LGM-30Minuteman III ICBM, which has the capacity to carry up to three 500 kiloton warheads.\nThese rockets have a range of about eight thousand miles, so theyre more than capable of striking targets in Russia, Iran, and North Korea; or, frankly, anyone anywhere in the world who threatens the safety and security of United States for that matter, Addison Twomey, a retired Air Force colonel, told CNNs Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday.\nGOP presidential candidate and U.S. senator Ted Cruz (R-Tx), who sits on the Senate Committee on Armed Services, voiced support for the decision to install the ICBM silos, saying, Its Congresss job to decide what is best for D.C. and its residents and in this case thats what weve done. Were creating jobs and security, two things the Obama administration has  for eight years  failed to do.\nSenator Cruz believes the ICBM silos will also serve to boost tourism in Washington, D.C. People like to see this sort of thing. Thats why the Nevada Test Site is such a popular tourist destination. Its a part of American history, its what makes this country great. Mr. Cruz said that even if he isnt elected in November, he still plans to bring his family to Washington to carry on our tradition of strolling along the Tidal Basin and admiring the cherry blossoms, and  once theyre complete  the ballistic missile silos.\nHistorically, Minuteman III ballistic missiles have been stationed atfourU.S. Air Force bases located in North Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming.

Residents of Hillsville, a small town in Carroll County, Virginia with a population just shy of 2,700, assembled in the gymnasium at Carroll County Middle School on Sunday to hear a presentation prepared by Army National Guard Brigadier General Franklin P.

The brigadier general has been appointed by the White House to head a new initiative enacted under a recent executive order by President Obama authorizing the federal government to sequester nearly 300 million firearms from private citizens across the United States.\nIts about winning hearts and minds, Brigadier General Marshal told the audience at Carroll County Middle School. In exchange for their compliance, the Obama administration is offering Americans who willingly turn over their weapons a sizable tax credit. Any American over the age of twenty-one who, by their own accord, turns in five or more firearms, will be exempt from paying federal income taxes in 2017, Brigadier General Marshal said.\nHowever, the brigadier general stressed that the incentive only applies to Americans who willingly forfeit their right to bear arms. Any individual -American or otherwise, who exercises deceit or tries in any way, shape, or form to circumvent these laws, will be met with the full force of the United States military, President Obama warned in a pre-recorded statement to the nation this week.\nIn accordance with the executive order which President Obama issued to combat rising gun violence in the United States, the White House has ordered a temporary suspension of thePosse Comitatus Act. Passed in 1873 by President Rutherford B. Hayes, the act limits the federal governments ability to use the military to enforce domestic policies.\nDuring times of national crisis, it becomes necessary to trade certain liberties for the benefit of added security, Robert Churchill, an attorney who specializes in constitutional law, told CNNs Wolf Blitzer Sunday.

Buck, who makes a living designing custom crossbows for hunting and home defense, said he turned over three firearms, including an Uzi submachine gun, to the Virginia National Guard. It was the right thing to do, he said.\nWhile the vast majority of confiscated firearms will be melted down under federal supervision, a small portion are to be used to arm various factions of moderate rebels fighting Assads forces in Syria.

The officer said opposition forces had entered the city under the cover of darkness Friday night and were rounding up anyone deemed loyal to Prince Nelson. They were executing people in the streets, said the officer before adding that several police precincts, including his own, had been firebombed in the ensuing chaos.\nMeanwhile, President Barack Obama on Saturday ordered two mechanized divisions consisting of some 45,000 soldiers and support units to the U.S.-Minnesota border. Let me be clear, President Obama declared in an address to the nation. The United States has no intention of becoming involved militarily in Minnesota. Ive asked our commanders on the ground to remain neutral and monitor events from our side of the border in an effort to prevent further destabilization in the region.\nDespite President Obamas assertion that U.S. forces would remain on American soil, a Pentagon official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the press, toldThe Washington Post that U.S. special operations forces have been deployed to the outskirts of St. Paul to locate and secure Prince Nelsons chemical weapons stockpile.\nPrince Nelson assumed the throne in 1958 and ruled Minnesota until his unexpected death on April 21, 2016. As Minnesotans continue to mourn the loss of their revered prince, the world is watching closely to see who will fill the power vacuum created in the wake of Prince Nelsons passing.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "The streets of St. Paul were peppered with broken glass and dozens of burned out vehicles were still smoldering from the previous night's riots."}

If youve purchased a Happy Meal from McDonalds in the last twelve months, chances are the Chinese government is monitoring and recording your daily movements. According to the Department of Justice, Chinese intelligence agents planted an estimated fifty million radio frequency identification (RFID) chips in products bound for the United States last year.\nThese chips have the ability to track an individuals movements in real-time and transmit uninterrupted audio and  in some cases  video back to their source, U.S. attorney general Loretta Lynch said during a press briefing on Friday. Following a six-month joint investigation with the Department of State, we were able to determine the source of these chips originates at the Chinese Ministry of State Security.\nSurprisingly, China has not denied the allegations. Hong Lei, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, toldThe Washington Post that China regularly inserts RFID chips into exports bound for the United States. Its standard practice, Hong said. The spokesman later added that the chips allow Chinese businesses to better analyze consumer trends overseas. Theres nothing sinister about it.\nHong said his countrys intelligence apparatus allocates approximately one hundred million RFID chips to Chinese businesses every year. The data they collect is transmitted to business owners and entrepreneurs via our [spy] satellites, Hong explained, further stating that Chinese intelligence analysts do not typically collect or review the data. Only in extreme circumstances, he said.\nU.S. officials became aware of the chips existence in mid January after an RFID chip embedded in a Chinese-made calculator emitted an electromagnetic pulse and subsequently shut down power to a maximum security prison in Maryland. As a result of the power outage, twelve inmates  all of whom were serving life sentences  escaped. All but three have been apprehended.\nIn an interview withReal News Right Now, Mr. Hong reluctantly admitted that RFID chips developed prior to 2014 were prone to error. However, Hong said China has recently released a next-generation RFID chip which contains a built-in self-destruct mechanism. The instrument initiates a small controlled explosion meant to disable the device while minimizing data loss.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "If you've purchased a Happy Meal from McDonald's in the last twelve months, chances are the Chinese government is monitoring your daily movements."}

Former Alaska governor and frequent Fox News contributor Sarah Palin said her Wasilla estate was overrun by a contingent of Black Lives Matter protesters over the weekend. In a rambling Facebook post, Palin revealed that she and her husband Todd had just sat down to enjoy a hearty Sunday morning breakfast when a horde of masked hooligans came pouring out of the woods and onto their property.\nFearing for their lives, Mr. and Mrs. Palin fled to the basement where they sealed themselves inside a state-of-the-art panic room  which the former vice presidential nominee installed immediately following President Obamas 2009 nomination  before contacting authorities. Palin described a moment of intense terror as she and Todd huddled together inside the small blast-resistant room, meanwhile rampant hooting and hollering could be heard from outside.\nBy the time Wasilla police had arrived at the Palin residence, the gang had vanished, leaving a chaotic scene of destruction in their wake. A spokesperson for the Wasilla police department told theMat-Su Valley Frontiersmanthat vandals had peppered the Palin compound with upwards of fifty dozen eggs. This was a well-coordinated attack, a source close to the Palin family told Fox News. What we know so far is that these individuals were well-trained and well-equipped. This was by no means amateur hour.\nPalin told authorities she initially believed the mob had been sent to silence her. They were here to suppress the voice of reason, she later charged on Facebook. These thugs were paid by the Obama administration to divide our nation. Palin went on to compare her experience to the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, lost their lives.\nAs of Monday evening, Wasilla authorities were still investigating a number of leads including a tip from the owner of a local grocery store who said hed sold a group of local kids approximately two hundred dollars worth of eggs less than an hour before the attack took place. This is the most credible information we have so far, Wasillas interim police chief Larry Dickerson said.\nDespite Chief Dickersons confidence that the matter would soon be resolved, Palin called the grocery store owners account a coincidence. The fact that theyre using a group of school children as scapegoats  it just goes to show you how far this administration is willing to go to cover for their friends in the Black Lives Matter movement, Palin told Fox News Shepard Smith, adding, Its sickening.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin said her Wasilla estate was overrun by a contingent of Black Lives Matter protesters over the weekend."}

From a distance, the Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center could pass for one of the many Anglo Territorial dwellings that pepper the eastern edge of the Mojave Desert. However, by the time you reach Fourth Ring Road, the picturesque Arizonan landscape gives way to a dusty narrow street lined with palm and date trees, flanked by the occasional dilapidated Toyota or Hyundai.\nI and two other journalists from NBC Nightly News have been invited to partake in a private tour of the theme park a few months ahead of its scheduled grand opening. Upon passing through the theme parks rear entrance, located just off Fourth Ring Road, we are met with a guard-house staffed by six theme park employees wearing Libyan police uniforms and armed with realistic looking AK-47 assault rifles. They wave us into the compound showing little interest.\nOnce inside the gate, we disembark from our vehicle and are promptly greeted by Andrew McKee, the theme parks General Manager. After asking us to sign a waiver, McKee explains the purpose of the Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center is to present visitors with a realistic and unadulterated view of the events that took place at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.\nMcKee explains that upon entering the theme park, we will witness, firsthand, a four-hour reenactment of the assault on the U.S. Consulate by Al Qaeda fighters. Here at the Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center, we employ a staff of roughly two hundred and fifty actors of Middle Eastern and African descent who play the role of the Islamic militants that carried out the worst terrorist attack on American soil since September 11, 2001, McKee said, adding, Throughout each reenactment, we utilize approximately three and a half million dollars worth of pyrotechnics.\nJust before dark, we are ushered through the large oak double doors leading into the U.S. Consulate building, where each of us receives a glossy index card, similar to those distributed at the Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., which feature one of the Americans killed during the attack. We are told that, during the reenactment, each of us will follow the final moments of the American whose name and picture appears on the card. I have received U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith.\nWithin moments of receiving our index cards, the sound of automatic gunfire can be heard from somewhere outside the compound. Then, the power to the Consulate goes out, save for a few dimly lit emergency lights, followed by the roar of an alarm. I can hear sounds of sporadic gunfire getting progressively louder, then suddenly, without warning, I am thrown into my colleague from NBC Nightly News as a massive explosion hits the side of the building.\nWe are engulfed in thick black smoke and I can feel the intense heat from the blast all over my body. We are choking and clawing our way to safety as Al Qaeda fighters outside lob grenades over the wall surrounding the U.S. Consulate. Simultaneously, militants are pouring into the compound under a volley of automatic weapons fire backed by truck-mounted artillery and anti-aircraft guns. Amid the chaos, we are told we have to reach the safe haven, a secure room within the Consulate.\nSomeone shoves what turns out to be an M4 carbine into my arms as Im told I must defend myself and protect the Ambassador. Another explosion rocks the building as we attempt to navigate the dark corridor. I feel a rush of hope wash over me as someone shouts that a Quick Reaction Force has been summoned, yet, in the end, we never encounter them.\nWe are abruptly directed into a room and given a brief respite from the intense violence happening outside. It takes me a moment to get my bearings before I realize were in a dark bedroom. In the corner of the room, in the bed, there appears to be a woman resembling Hillary Clinton sound asleep, and next to her, on the nightstand, I can make out the greenish glow of an alarm clock reading 3 a.m. I suddenly realize a telephone has been ringing nonstop since we entered the room.\nAs quickly as we came in, we are rushed out of the room into an ultra-violent madness that seems to grow more intense by the second. Most of the Consulate is on fire now and we encounter groups of Al Qaeda fighters who are clad in flak jackets and ski masks, shouting Allahu Akbar while charging us with machine guns.\nFollowing the end of the four-hour reenactment, we are met, once again, by Andrew McKee, who passes out bottled water and granola bars, while thanking us for coming to the Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center to witness this tragic and avoidable moment in American history. We are then asked to make a purchase at the Gift Shop before departing the theme park, I dont find anything particularly appealing in the shop, which is mostly stocked with conservative literature, but I end up buying a Limited Edition Lego U.S. Consulate Benghazi set for my nephew.\nThe Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center is due to officially open September 11, 2015 and offers group rates as well as individual tickets which can be purchased online or by calling the theme park directly. The standard fee for adults as $49.99, however seniors and children under 12 are eligible for a heavily discounted price of $9.11.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "The Benghazi Theme Park and Educational Center could pass for one of the many Anglo Territorial dwellings that pepper the eastern edge of the Mojave Desert."}

Three people were killed and more than a dozen were injured Sunday evening after Secret Service agents tasked with protecting GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump opened fire on a group of protesters at the Sunset Cove Amphitheater in Palm Beach County.\nThe incident occurred moments after Trump, who was addressing a crowd of nearly twenty thousand enthusiastic supporters, ordered his security detail to put down a group of Latino protesters who were waving a homemade Were Not Rapists banner. These people make me sick, Trump declared minutes after his security detail had fired more than thirty-eight rounds into the group -later identified as students from Florida Atlantic University- killing two of them instantly.\nThe third individual, an eighteen year-old FAU freshman, was dragged unconscious through the crowd as Trump supporters violently kicked and beat him, many using bottles, lawn chairs, and anything they could get their hands on, as weapons. The Maryland native, who had been shot five times by Trumps security detail, later died due to significant blunt force injuries, according to the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner.\nAmid the chaos that followed, Donald Trump declared that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had sent his communist sympathizers here to sabotage our evening.

The Chinese government announced Sunday that it will provide funding to Planned Parenthood, a womens health organization which the U.S. House of Representatives voted last week to defund. Li Bin, who heads Chinas National Health and Family Planning Commission, said China will contribute $528 million to Planned Parenthood for the 2016 fiscal year in exchange for the continued donation of tissue samples which China plans to apply towards stem cell research.\nChina is committed to working towards a better future, not just for the Chinese people but for all people around the world, Li said. It is for this reason we have entered into a partnership with Planned Parenthood. It is not Chinas intention to meddle in Americas political affairs, but nonetheless a womans right to medical treatment should not be jeopardized by the ever-changing political climate.\nIn accordance with the agreement, Planned Parenthood will ship fetal tissue samples to several Chinese biomedical research and testing facilities on a monthly basis. Chinese scientists will then use the fetal tissue for a variety of medical related experiments including stem cell research and cloning. China is committed to the advancement of human life through medical research, Li said.\nThe Chinese government provides abortion services to women upon request except for the purpose of sex-selection, a method by which an expectant mother terminates the fetus based on the predicted sex of the child. China has historically used abortion as a means for population control and although the government doesnt make public the exact number of abortions conducted annually, in 2008 it was estimated that the government performed approximately 13 million abortions. By comparison, there were an estimated 1.2 million abortions in the United States in 2008, amounting to roughly 2% of the female population.\nPlanned Parenthood came under fire recently amid allegations that the non-profit organization had been profiting off of the sale of fetal body parts. As a result, lawmakers introduced the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015, which passed the House last week but conservative lawmakers are skeptical as to whether it will successfully pass a Senate vote.

Due to the Potomacs often murky waters, Blatter said his boats frequently circle the shallow waters off the coast of Roosevelt Island where the bull sharks have been known to hang out.\nHowever, as a result of increased boat traffic on the Potomac, some tour boat operators are turning to a process known as chumming to lure sharks away from Roosevelt Island and into other shallow areas of the river.

In the wake of another mass shooting, this time in Kalamazoo, Michigan, when an Uber driver shot and killed six people over the weekend, President Barack Obama, speaking from the Oval Office on Wednesday, laid out his latest plan to curb gun violence in America, calling the new initiative a sensible incentive-based program.\nLargely based around past state-funded gun buyback-style programs, Obamas new plan, which goes into effect nationwide on March 2nd, gives Americans the choice to turn their weapons over to the federal government once a month on a no-questions-asked basis. Let me be clear, explained President Obama. No one is under any obligation, legal or otherwise, to participate in the program. This is a volunteer-only initiative.\nHowever, Obama continued, each American who chooses to take part in the program, regardless of criminal history, will receive a voucher for every firearm they turn over to the federal government. These vouchers, Obama explained, are electronically entered into a national lottery system created and implemented by this administration. At the end of each month well hold a nationally televised drawing to announce a winner.\nOn the first Tuesday of every month, starting in April of 2016, one lucky American will have the chance to sit in on a CIA drone operation where they will have the rare opportunity to assume command of a live drones remote firing controls and -under CIA supervision- execute a suspected terrorist. Citing national security concerns, the president said award winners will not be told the names or locations of the terror suspects who have been targeted for assassination. Youll simply be told when to fire, President Obama said.\nChris Rutherford, a fifty-one year-old registered Republican from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, toldFox Newsthat he cannot wait to enter into the national lottery. Im a proud Trump supporter and lifetime member of the NRA, Rutherford said, continuing, I own twelve guns including my grandfathers M1903 Springfield, and you better believe I plan to hand each and every one of them over to Mr. Obama.\nRutherford isnt the only one excited about Obamas gun buyback initiative. Sandra Glass, a mother of six from Austin, Texas, toldReal News Right Now that she intends to take out a second mortgage on her home so she can afford to buy enough guns to enter herself and her two oldest sons into the national lottery once a month. Consider it their high school graduation present, Mrs. Glass said with a chuckle.\nThe National Rifle Association has not yet issued a statement on the program but an NRA official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Washington Post that if there were ever a legitimate reason to give up your guns, this is it.\nThe complete terms and conditions of President Obamas national lottery program are expected to be outlined on the White Houses official websitelate next week.

The cop ordered me to drop my gun and I said What gun? and he shot me. I couldnt believe it. Gentry, who is white, is one of three people who have been gunned down by police after purchasing a costume from Chesters Party Supply Store in the last week.\nAccording to the stores owner, Chester Dudley, the three victims share one thing in common: they all purchased one of the most sought-after Halloween costumes of the year. Simply called the Unarmed Black Man, the costume consists of khaki style pants, a blue hoodie, and black face paint and has outsold other top-selling outfits including Harley Quinn and Harambe the Gorilla. Its an extremely popular item, Dudley told Action News before adding that the costume had been regretfully pulled from the stores inventory as of Friday morning.\nWhile Gentry is expected to make a full recovery, Blake OConnell, another frequent patron of Chesters Party Supply Store, isnt so lucky. The twenty-three year-old FSU graduate was shot nineteen times by police mere seconds after leaving a Halloween office party Wednesday evening. Authorities later said OConnell  who was wearing an Unarmed Black Man costume when he was killed  fit the description of an armed robbery suspect. Officers acted professionally and exercised restraint during what they perceived to be a very dangerous situation, a department spokesperson said on Wednesday.\nIn yet another case of mistaken identity, police on Thursday arrested nineteen year-old Logan Brown while he was attempting to hang Halloween decorations on the front porch of his parents home in suburban Jacksonville. Brown, who was also in costume at the time, was tasered three times and sustained multiple lacerations from a police dog before being taken into custody.

Witnesses state both vehicles were traveling well above the posted speed limit as they approached a four-way intersection clearly marked with traffic signals.

As a resultfour civilian vehicles were damaged and eleven people injured, including a sixty-seven year old Iraqi woman who suffered a concussion and was taken to a hospital by ambulance.\nLt. James Patterson and Pvt. Slauson are each facing three counts of war crimes. The specific charges include reckless driving, failure to stop at a stop sign, and fleeing the scene of an accident. If convicted, both men could serve up to thirty days in jail. We intend to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law and provide the Iraqi people with the justice they so desperately seek, Mueller said.\nAdditionally, Corporal Joseph Griffin is facing one count, with the charge of littering.

People die every day, the son of a slaughterhouse kill floor supervisor told News 4 San Antonio. The way I see it, my job is to turn what is otherwise a bleak and dismal situation into something beautiful.\nNow, a new Texas law requiring women to bury their aborted fetuses has the potential to double, or even triple, Fosters already booming profits. Were very excited for the future, he told News 4. This is huge for the funeral industry. So huge, in fact, that Foster and a longtime business associate recently pooledtogether nearly $1 million to launch a startup company specializing in handcrafted caskets built specifically for fetuses and fetal tissue.\nWere doing some very interesting things and really trying to move away from the traditional style caskets that most people are used to seeing, Foster explained. Right now our clients have the option of choosing from a number of very elegant casket styles. My personal favorite is our 2.75-inch cherry oak Signature casket. Affordably priced between $899 and $1,199 with the option to add a variety of upgrades, Foster said the matchbox-sized casket is an ideal choice for most fetuses aborted during the first trimester.\nFor anything beyond that first trimester, we offer a wide selection of attractive cases which youll find on display in our showroom. Foster continued, saying, These pieces range in size from a childs lunch box all the way up to the exquisite Fosters Limited Edition; this is a shoe box-sized glass sarcophagus available in both polished and stained glass. The Limited Edition casket, which Foster claims is in high demand, sells for a whopping $7,899 before additional upgrades such as plush lining or a miniature down pillow. For those wish to avoid the stress of a financial burden in their time of grieving, we offer a very convenient and flexible payment plan, he added.\nHowever, Foster says his business model is about more than just selling high-end caskets to the discerning mourner. Our clients have the option of choosing from an assortment of affordable funeral and memorial packages, he said. The Standard Service, Fosters most popular package, which is priced at $2,399, includes a wake or viewing and a traditional burial ceremony. Its like any other service you might attend, Foster admitted. However, the difference, he said, is in the presentation. We decorate the casket with a beautiful floral bouquet and adorn the surrounding walls with high-resolution ultrasound photographs provided at no additional cost by your doctor.

Retired U.S. Air Force General Buck Turgidson, who worked with the National Security Agency from 1999 until late 2005, has intimate knowledge regarding the circumstances surrounding Zuckerbergs employment.\nHe was a senior architect of the PRISM program, he stated during a interview last week on Fox & Friends. General Turgidson went on to say that Facebook was designed as an extension of PRISM in that it created massive data gathering capabilities. It revolutionized the way we gather information on a large scale, meanwhile bypassing federal surveillance laws because users make the choice to voluntarily give up personal information.\nAccording to classified NSA documents leaked by former employee and whistle-blower Edward Snowden and later released to the American public by journalist Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept, Zuckerberg met regularly with top U.S. intelligence officials in closed-door sessions. However, the details of these sessions were never recorded. In an email response to questions submitted by this reporter, Facebooks Public Relations director April O. Neel confirmed that Mr. Zuckerberg attends biweekly sessions at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade strictly as a pro bono consultant.\nIf true, these allegations could explain why in March of last year, Facebook requisitioned a secure, climate controlled, server storage facility roughly the size of two football fields at the Utah Data Center, a massive data mining complex operated by the National Security Agency.\nGeneral Turgidson, who agreed to meet with this reporter at an undisclosed location yesterday, defended the PRISM program as well as Facebooks alleged involvement, citing national security concerns amid an ever growing age of technology. He called the clear invasion of privacy necessary and added, Its no secret that Facebook openly employs the use of surveillance technology, whether it be global positioning services or facial recognition software. The public is aware of it and they accept it. Its right there in the Terms of Service.\nOvershadowed by these groundbreaking allegations against Zuckerberg is the mysterious disappearance of Facebook intern James Olsen. Olsen, who accepted a post-college internship with the social media company late last year, posted a cell phone video he took during a staff meeting at Facebook headquarters in which Zuckerberg can be heard allegedly shouting, Privacy is not a right, its a privilege! The video was uploaded to the media sharing site YouTube on January 5th, 2015, however it was pulled by the site less than four hours later.\nA programmer currently working for Facebook, who spoke to this reporter on the condition of anonymity, said he witnessed plain clothes security officers armed with handguns forcibly remove Olsen from Facebook headquarters.

We were able to register nearly twenty thousand voters over the span of three days.\nOnce residents were successfully registered to vote, ACORN officials ushered them into a room where about a dozen voting booths had been set up. We wanted to get an idea of the average voters understanding of the election process, Breyer said before adding that voters were asked to enter a booth and cast their vote for the candidate of their choice.

She won by a massive landslide, recalled Breyer. The data we collected seems to suggest that a sizable number of Republican voters are unable to read above a third grade level and are simply casting votes by selecting the color that corresponds with their preferred party.\nThis should be a major wake up call and I think we need to take a hard look at the educational system in this country, said Fox News contributor and Republican strategist Barry King.

During a ceremony at the Governors Mansion in Austin this weekend, Texas governor Greg Abbott unveiled The Lone Star States official rifle, an American-made FGM-148Javelin Portable Anti-Tank Missile. This rifle symbolizes American ingenuity and superiority, declared Gov. Abbott as two service members from the Texas Army National Guard removed the weapon from its polymer case and prominently displayed it at the governors feet.\nCritics and gun-control advocates alike say the Javelin Portable Anti-Tank Missile is not a rifle at all but a dangerous anti-aircraft weapon designed to destroy armored vehicles, helicopters, and buildings. However, according to the NRAs Executive Vice President, Wayne LaPierre, The Javelin, by definition, meets all the characteristics of a rifle. Its a shoulder-fired weapon that fires a single projectile.\nJust because the single projectile happens to be a 127-millimeter high explosive warhead with an automatic self-guidance system, proponents say the Javelin, like other large-bore rifles in its class, is prone to unfair discrimination. Everythings bigger in Texas, explained Gov. Abbott. Especially our guns. The governor boasted that he personally owns two Javelin Portable Anti-Tank Missile rifles. I mostly use em for hunting boar, he added with a chuckle.\nWith an MSRP of $246,000, the Javelin Portable Anti-Tank Missile rifle is primarily geared toward advanced shooters. Its not a great beginner rifle, partly due to the price tag, said Robert Henderson, a contributing writer forAmerican Huntermagazine. But if you can afford it and you have a good amount of land, its a helluva lot of fun to shoot.\nTexas is the second state to declare an official rifle this week. On Wednesday, February 28th, the Barrett M82.50 caliber anti-materiel rifle became the Official Rifle of Tennessee. Designed for use against unarmored and lightly armored military vehicles, the semi-automatic M82 is a favorite among Tennesseans who enjoy vaporizing rabbits and other small game.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Texas governor Greg Abbott unveiled The Lone Star State's official rifle, an American-made FGM-148 Javelin Portable Anti-Tank Missile."}

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is reportedly consideringa possible run forthe White House in 2016, Canadas leading news agency, CBC News, reported Friday. The forty-three year-old Ottawa native, who was elected into office in November of this year, has been calledthe Alex Trebek of politicsfor his soft-spoken mannerisms andintellect, often consideredrare traits in the political realm.\nBordering the northern half of the continentalUnited States, Canadaisperhaps best known for its maple syrup. The popular pancake topping isCanadas largest export andmakes up formore than 70% of the countrysgross domestic product. Since taking office less than forty days ago,Mr. Trudeau has more than tripled Canadas maple syrup production and, in the process, created more than seventy new jobs. Prime Minister Trudeau has done more for Canada in one month than Wayne Gretzky did in his entire career, boasted fellow Canadian William Shatner during a recent interview with The Toronto Star.\nPrime Minister Trudeau made national headlines againthis week when he traveled to Torontos Pearson International Airport topersonally greetmore thanone hundred and sixty Syrianswho had arrived seeking refuge from an increasingly dire humanitariancrisis in their war-torn nation. In Trudeaus own words, the decision to accept an estimated25,000 Syrian refugees was Canadas way of showing the world how to open our hearts.\nDespite Mr. Trudeaus perceived good intentions, the move has left asickly taste in the mouths ofmany Americans. That sort of thing wouldnt fly here in the United States, said George Allen, a seniorcampaign strategist for Texas Senator Ted Cruz. Its contradictory to our values as a nation and quite frankly, its un-American. Allencalled Mr. Trudeaus decision to accept unvetted outsiders questionable, adding that had it happened in the U.S.,Mr. Trudeauwould almost certainlyface a congressional investigation.\nNonetheless, Justin Trudeau believes he has what it takes to run a real country. The Canadianprime minister told CBCNewson Friday that he has just as much a right to the U.S. presidency as former Canadian citizenand currentU.S. senatorTed Cruz.

Loss prevention agents working under Mr. Trumps direction have amassed a detailed database containing the name, address, and marital status of every Muslim employed by the Trump Organization.\nIn addition, the database contains similar information relating to each employees frequent contacts, which includeimmediate family members,relatives, and acquaintances. A separate list within the database contains the names and addresses of nearly three thousand employees who are described as Suspected Muslims, meaning their religious beliefs have not been confirmed by Loss Prevention agents but observed statements and behavioral factors indicate they couldidentify asMuslims.\nA packet of documents dated November 3, 2015, and marked confidential includes a draft of an email purportedly notifying employees of an upcoming all expenses paid mandatory corporate retreat. Advertised as a family friendly event, the retreat is set for the weekend of January 23rd in Nevada.

An Amber Alert was called off Friday afternoon after police arrested a child predator who led them on a fifty mile high-speed chase that spanned two states and left eleven people, including four police officers, dead.\nIt all began Friday morning when Carla Menendez, a third grade teacher at New Castle Elementary School, noticed her student, eight-year old Kyle Jefferson, was absent from class. School officials contacted Kyles parents, Tom and Eileen Jefferson, who said the last theyd seen or heard from their son had been when he boarded a county school bus just an hour before. It was then that school officials notified the New Castle Country Police Department, who issued an Amber Alert for Kyle Jefferson.\nAt approximately 10:05 a.m. New Castle police received a call from a concerned citizen who spotted the young Kyle Jefferson near The Home Depot on Sunset Boulevard. Officers were en route to The Home Depot when a dispatcher notified them that the silent alarm had been triggered nearby at the Citizens Bank on North Dupont Highway.\nPolice arrived on the scene to find mild-manneredKyle Jefferson exiting Citizens Bank, with his backpack -whichappeared to be stuffed with cash-around his shoulders, while brandishing a Uzi submachine gun. Before police could intervene, Kyle, who came in Second Place in his schools science fair this year, opened fire on the officers vehicles. In the ensuing chaos, young Kyle Jefferson was able to hijack a New Castle Police cruiser and flee the scene.\nMoments later additional units were in pursuit of the stolen police car as it traveled south on Dupont Highway while weaving in and out of traffic. Miraculously, the unassuming eight-year-old was able to shoot out the tires of the lead police car, causing it to veer off the road into a Sunocogas station where it struck a fuel line and exploded. The resulting fire destroyed five nearby businesses, including the Sunoco, and left seven people dead.\nShortly after passing the Maryland-Delaware state line, the youthful Kyle Jeffersons commandeered police car encountered a roadblock set up by Maryland State Troopers. Upon hitting a spike strip at one hundred miles per hour, Kyles front tires were torn apart causing the vehicle to flip over roughly nine times before coming to a rest on the median. Officers rushed the vehicle, taking the child, who was remarkably unharmed, into custody. Kyle Jefferson, who officers described as extremely polite, was found to have a fully automatic Uzi submachine gun, $2,500 in cash, and a two-pound bag of lollipops in his possession.\nHes just never done anything like this before in his life, said Eileen Jefferson, Kyles mother, who, like many others in New Castle County, spoke very highly of her son. Mrs. Jefferson believes Kyle may have become overly excited after playing the video game Grand Theft Auto V at a friends house earlier in the week. Its the only possible explanation I can think of, she said. Police are currently investigating the matter and, as of press time, no charges have been filed.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "An Amber Alert was called off Friday afternoon after police arrested a child predator who led them on a fifty mile high-speed chase that spanned two states."}

A spokesperson for the Manitowoc District Attorneys Office announced on Tuesday that state prosecutors will appear in federal court this week to file first degree murder charges against Manitowoc resident Steven Avery. In light of new evidence, we believe Mr. Avery played a senior role in the shooting death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1968, said Ryan Peters, a spokesperson for the DAs office.\nProsecutors allege that Mr. Avery, who is already serving a life sentence at the Waupun Correctional Institution in southeastern Wisconsin for first degree murder, traveled to Memphis, Tennessee -even staying in the Lorraine Motel on two occasions, in the days and weeks leading up to the assassination of late civil rights leader. Mr. Avery played a key role in the planning and execution of this brazen act and its high time that justice is served, Mr. Peters said.\nAt the request of state prosecutors, Manitowoc County sheriffs deputies traveled to Tennessee on official orders last month where they recovered a plethora of DNA belonging to Steven Avery. Mr. Peters said investigators were primarily focused on room 306 of the Lorraine Motel where Dr. King was staying the day he was shot and killed. Investigators say the motel, which was converted into the National Civil Rights Museum in 2014, was awash with traces of Mr. Avery. Its like he was just there yesterday, Mr. Peters commented. The DNA, which is said to include skin and hair follicles, has since been turned over to the FBI and is undergoing testing at a forensics lab in Quantico, Virginia.\nIn addition, investigators have reexamined evidence obtained by the FBI in the days following Dr. Kings assassination. Included in the treasure trove of evidence are a set of binoculars and the .30-06 Winchester rifle that was used in the shooting. Following an intensive forensics analysis, Mr. Averys fingerprints were found not just on the trigger, but all over the weapon, said Mr. Peters, who added that Mr. Avery likely obtained the rifle through legal means.\nA representative for the Avery family told WBAY Action 2 News -a Wisconsin ABC affiliate, that contrary to the allegations made by Manitowoc prosecutors, Mr. Avery has never been to Tennessee. Hes never even left the state, the spokesperson said. Furthermore, Mr. Averys defense team, in a statement released Tuesday, argued that Mr. Avery couldnt have been involved in Dr. Kings assassination because at the time of the shooting he was barely six years old.\nHowever, Manitowoc County prosecutors say none of that matters. Such theories and coincidences are irrelevant to the investigation, said Peters when questioned by a reporter with the Green Bay Press Gazette. Were in the business of presenting facts and examining evidence. Thats how we solve cases.\nIf convicted, Mr. Avery could find himself facing an additional life sentence for the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The prominent civil rights leader was thirty-nine years old at the time of his death.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "\"In light of new evidence, we believe Mr. Avery played a senior role in the shooting death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1968.\""}

Kraft said the offensive sketch was immediately confiscated and the seven year-old boy was turned over to a school resource officer.\nWhile school officials had initially sought to suspend the juvenile, news of the defacement spread quickly and irate parents began phoning the school and calling for his immediate expulsion.

Many students have parents who are veterans so this was something that hit close to home for a lot of folks.\nRetired U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Roger Harrison is one of those folks.

An Indiana man who had a recent near-death experience after tragic car accident left him in a coma says he made a shocking discovery during a brief trip to the afterlife. Forty-eight year-old Thomas Miller of Fort Wayne, who sustained a traumatic brain injury and lost both his legs after a head-on collision with a tractor-trailer, called the experience a turning point in his life. Its really put things into perspective for me, Miller told WFFT News, a local Fox affiliate.\nImmediately after the crash, Miller described being wrapped in a blanket of warmth and feeling his body rise through the mangled remains of his Toyota Prius and up into the sky by a loving presence. But Miller says once he passed through the pearly gates, things took a nasty turn. There were dinosaurs everywhere, an emotional Miller told WFFT. Some were as tall as buildings and they were just killing and eating everyone. There was so much chaos; so much destruction.\nDr. Brian Rosenbaum, a neurologist at St. Joseph Hospital in Fort Wayne, says its common for people who have suffered a traumatic brain injury to experience vision-like dreams. To put it simply, when you have a multi-sensory disintegration occur at the temporoparietal junction, the result is a disruption of various cognitive functions that regulate the brains ability to self-process, Rosenbaum explained. This is when people might believe they are having a so-called near-death experience.\nHowever, Miller is certain his experience wasnt the result of a disruption of his cognitive functions. I personally witnessed a pack of velociraptors chase down a group of angels and tear them limb from limb, he told WFFT News. It was hands down the most horrific thing Ive ever seen in my life. Miller, who considers himself a devout Catholic, said the Heaven depicted in the bible is a total war zone. I just cant wrap my head around how something like this is possible.\nFortunately for Miller, Father Robert Parsons of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis might have an answer. Several years ago, His Holiness Pope Francis declared that all of Gods creatures have a place in the Kingdom of Heaven, Father Parsons toldReal News Right Now. In the event this proclamation extends to the dinosaurs  and there is no evidence it doesnt  then we must assume there are millions of them in Heaven. After all, these creatures ruled the earth for nearly sixty-five million years.\nAs far as Thomas Miller is concerned, Father Parsons explanation offers little in the way of comfort. After his experience, Miller says the concept of life after death no longer holds any appeal. Even so, I keep playing the events over and over in my mind, he said. The last thing I remember was Saint Peter grabbing me by the collar, shaking me, and yelling, Stop sending people here, its not safe!

The National Security Agency announced it has purchased Verizon Wireless, a major telecommunications provider and subsidiary of Verizon Communications, for $9 billion. The acquisition effectively brings with it some 135.5 million customers, making it one of the largest state-owned enterprises in the United States.\nIn a statement released by the NSA Friday afternoon, Director Michael S. Rogers said Verizon Wireless customers will notice little to no change in service during the transition period. However, Director Rogers added, current and future customers can look forward to exciting and affordable wireless plans as well as increased 4G coverage. By utilizing an array of satellites already in use by the NSA, Verizon Wireless will expand its reach and coverage to include areas outside the continental United States, Rogers said.\nBeginning September 1st, Verizon Wireless will offer smart phoneplans starting at as little as $25 a month. In addition, all wireless plans will include up to 1 terabyte of cloud storage and unlimited long distance calls on nights and weekends. For just $2 more a month, customers can enjoy unlimited international calls to Africa and the Middle East, said Jacob Hersch, the newly appointedSenior Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Verizon Wireless. Hersch, who has prior experience in telecommunications, previously directed the NSAs now-defunct domestic surveillance program.\nDirector Rogers said the NSA is in the process of transferringits newly acquiredVerizon Wireless servers, which include customer information and records, to its Utah Data Center. Located just outside Bluffdale at Camp Williams, the center primarily serves as a data storage facility for the U.S. Intelligence Community.\nVerizon Wireless is ranked first in overall performance among the top four major wireless providers in the United States, which include AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile. The NSA plans to maintain its position by expanding cellular and data coverage beyond the United States. You dont need to be American to enjoy 4G speeds or higher, said Director Rogers.

Its a very fair proposal and, frankly, I think its something that folks on both sides can learn to embrace and appreciate.\nIf passed, the new law would require people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender to use state-approved bathrooms and changing facilities that are, according to Governor McCroy, located a safe distance from facilities frequented by children and the elderly. Specifically, the law states that LGBT-only restrooms must be stationed no less than fifty yards away from traditional facilities.\nFirst and foremost, this is about protecting our children from predators, declared Gov. McCroy, who added the LGBT-only facilities are merely the first step in a series of measures meant to keep children out of harms way.

Lawyers representing Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dozhokhar Tsarnaev filed a civil suit against the Watertown Police Department during a hearing at the Boston Municipal Court this morning. Citing Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act, the suit alleges Waterford police used excessive force leading up to and during the apprehension of Tsarnaev. The 21-year-old is facing thirty charges for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy to bomb a place of public use resulting in death.\nLionel Hutz, the lead attorney handling Tsarnaevs case, spoke to reporters on the courthouse steps, saying,The Watertown police, and other law enforcement agencies, violated my clients civil rights countless times on the night of April 19th, 2013. Regardless of the charges levied against my client, he is an American citizen, and therefore innocent until proven guilty. Mr. Hutz said he intends to use police testimony from the federal trial against Tsarnaev to show what he calls an excessive and brutal use of force as a result of a heavily militarized law enforcement operation.\nTed Buckland, a member of Tsarnaevs defense team, told this reporter that in the moments leading up to his arrest, while Dozhokhar, who was unarmed, sought refuge inside the boat, officers from Watertown and other agencies unleashed a barrage of preemptive gunfire into the craft prior to deploying dozens of concussion grenades. Buckland says the defense team is seeking $150 million in punitive damages from the Watertown Police Department, part of which will be used to pay for Tsarnaevs defense in federal court.\nTsarnaevs defense team believes they have a rock solid case against Waterford PD. In the last decade weve seen an unprecedented rise in the use of excessive force against American citizens, particularly minorities. This case is no different from Ferguson where we had Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen, gunned down by an overzealous police officer, and the subsequent response to that was to deploy, basically, a militarized force into the city resulting in innumerable civil rights violations. Its simply unacceptable, Hutz says.\nDozhokhar Tsarnaev is being charged for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing which killed 3 spectators and injured an estimated 264 people. In addition he faces charges for the murder of Sean A. Collier, an MIT police officer.

Twelve Russian nationals were taken into custody on Thursday after heavily armed FBI agents conducted a pre-dawn raid on a warehouse in Manhattans Garment District where authorities say a fake news manufacturing ring has been operating with near impunity for the last eighteen months.\nWeve struck a major blow to the fake news industry, announced Special Agent Walter Greenwald during a press conference at the FBIs Manhattan office. These despicable individuals have  for months  deliberately manipulated the publics perception with the sole purpose of turning a profit. Special Agent Greenwald said the FBI confiscated more than a dozen printing press machines which the suspects used to mass-produce fake newspapers before peddling them on street corners to unsuspecting New Yorkers.\nDescribing the operation as highly sophisticated, authorities said the perpetrators were able to produce thousands of knock-off newspapers per week at a cost of mere pennies, meanwhile netting upwards of $1.50 a pop for the illicit tabloids. They were making a killing, explained one law enforcement official who spoke toReal News Right Now on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Among the mountains of evidence seized during the raid, the official said FBI agents recovered tens of thousands of copies of a multi-page fake news publication titledThe New York Toast, a seemingly obvious imitation of the popular and widely circulatedNew York Post.\nHowever, according to Special Agent Greenwald, the FBIs discovery of the illegal printing press operation is only the tip of the iceberg. During Tuesdays press conference, Greenwald produced what appeared to be a freshly printed copy ofThe Wall Street Journal. What youre looking at is a fake newspaper, explained Greenwald. Its not real. Indeed, the object was in fact a molded slab of plastic which, from a distance, resembled a real newspaper. Greenwald said the counterfeit item was one of nearly a quarter million fabrications that have been seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents over the past month.\nAuthorities described a disturbing hierarchy in the underground world of fake news where anonymous individuals and organizations  many of whom identify themselves by cryptic pseudonyms or aliases  compete for likes, views, and shares. Those with the most shares reign supreme, said Brian, a former fake news producer who spoke to Real News Right Nowon Tuesday. Its a cutthroat multi-national enterprise where no news is safe.\nThe widespread fake news epidemic, which became especially prolific in the months leading up to the U.S. presidential election, has become an issue of national debate. Under mounting pressure, both Google and Facebook have announced plans to crack down on the spread of fake news.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Twelve Russian nationals were taken into custody on Thursday after heavily armed FBI agents conducted a pre-dawn raid on a warehouse in Manhattan..."}

The Islamic State has taken it upon itself to adopt a portion of Interstate 495, otherwise known as the Capital Beltway, according to Jeremiah Morrison, an official with the Virginia Department of Transportation who oversees the states Adopt-a-Highway program.\nThe segment of 495 which theyve opted to take responsibility for begins at Exit 50A for Arlington Boulevard and ends at Exit 47A for Leesburg Pike-Tysons Corner, Morrison said. The VDOT spokesman went on to say that ISIS has vowed to uphold cleanliness standards set in place by the Department of Transportation while also enforcing its own brand of Islamic law within the four-mile stretch of roadway.\nAs of Friday, February 26th, drivers reported seeing several flags bearing the Islamic States logo hanging from overpasses and other signage along 495 North. I think its nice theyre taking an interest in preserving our roads, one commuter, who identified himself as Derek, told WTOP-FM, a Washington Metropolitan area radio station.\nAt the request of the Islamic State, VDOT is advising drivers who frequent the four-mile stretch between Clarendon and Tysons Corner to observe Islamic values and laws while passing through. Drivers should keep a spare change of traditional Islamic clothing in their vehicles, Mr. Morrison said, continuing, In accordance with Islamic law, women are not permitted to operate a motor vehicle while driving on this portion of 495 unless they are accompanied by a male relative.\nIn addition, the Islamic State has declared it will administer swift justice to the occupants of any vehicle caught using 495s Express Lane without a properly displayed EZPass device mounted on the windshield. It is the will of Allah himself that any infidel caught traveling in the Express Lane without an EZPass shall face death by crucifixion, proclaimed a member of the Islamic State on Twitter Friday evening.\nISIS isnt the only extremist group to take advantage of the Adopt-a-Highway program. The Hutaree militia, part of Michigans right-wing militia movement, was a prominent contributor to the program until several of its founding members were arrested for plotting to killlaw enforcement officials. More recently, the Ku Klux Klan, a white-supremacist hate group, found itself in a heated court battleover whether or not it has the right to adopt a segment of a major highway in Georgia. The American Civil Liberties Union, a well-known rights organization, has opted to represent the KKK in the case.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "The Islamic State has taken it upon itself to 'adopt' a portion of Interstate 495, otherwise known as the Capital Beltway, according to VDOT."}
