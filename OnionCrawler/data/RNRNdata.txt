In an effort to further prevent the spread of the Zika virus, the Centers for Disease Control on Tuesday issued a new travel advisory asking Americans who plan to travel to Central and South America this summer to pack plenty of cigarettes and tonic water.\nCigarette smoking actually has some health benefits in that in that it works as a natural deterrent to mosquitoes, Dr. Raymond Goodwin, an infectious disease specialist at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, explained. When you exhale tobacco smoke, you are  in a sense  creating a temporary force field around your body which mosquitoes are simply unable to penetrate.\nThe CDC is asking those who are traveling to regions and countries where Zika is most prevalent, including Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, Haiti, Honduras, Venezuela, and Puerto Rico, to consider postponing travel plans until more is known about the virus.\nIn the event travel is unavoidable, Dr. Goodwin said Americans  particularly pregnant women  who visit the affected regions should make a concentrated effort to smoke as many cigarettes as possible throughout the duration of their trip. If youre outdoors or in an area where mosquitoes are common, the best line of defense is frequent consumption of tonic water coupled with incessant smoking, Goodwin advised. Also, consider lathering yourself in bug spray and, if you can, keep a citronella candle burning nearby at all times.\nDr. Goodwin said by adhering to the necessary precautions, travelers are far less likely to contract the Zika virus through a mosquito bite. However, the CDC warns the possibility of catching it through sexual transmission remains high.\nTo further assist travelers in the protecting themselves against the Zika virus, the CDC, working in conjunction with the Transportation Security Administration, is issuing one free carton of Marlboro brand cigarettes to travelers who are destined for Central and South America for trips lasting one week or less.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "In an effort to further prevent the spread of the Zika virus, the Centers for Disease Control on Tuesday issued a new travel advisory asking Americans..."}

President Barack Obama will exercise his executive powers on Monday when he signs an executive order issuing a temporary suspension of habeas corpus in Morton County, North Dakota, where protesters aligned with the Standing Rock Indian reservation are preventing construction of a crucial portion of the Dakota Access oil pipeline.\nYour voices have been heard, President Obama declared during an address to demonstrators. However, I dont think the answer is to continue stonewalling the inevitable. The president, who previously expressed support for the demonstrations, called the pipeline an important and necessary part of American infrastructure, saying, This is something that will enhance and strengthen our nation for generations to come.\nThe writ of habeas corpus, which grants prisoners or detainees the right to challenge the legality of their imprisonment, is covered in the Suspension Clause of the U.S. Constitution under Article One and, as such, shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\nFor federal authorities in North Dakota, the writs suspension allows for far greater powers in terms of arrest and detainment of protesters, journalists, and other disruptive individuals. Whether they admit it or not, a lot of these people who have presented themselves as reporters are actively taking steps to impede the construction of this pipeline, said Major General Arnold Dohlmann of the North Dakota Army National Guard. Backed by force of fifteen hundred seasoned soldiers, Maj, Gen. Dohlmann is set to assume command of law enforcement operations in Morton County immediately following President Obamas suspension of habeas corpus on Monday.\nAs it stands, my orders are to detain anyone suspected of interfering with the continued efforts by Energy Transfer Partners and their respective contractors to install the Dakota Access Pipeline. Further, Ive received authorization from the White House to hold these individuals until construction of the pipeline is completed. Maj. Gen. Dohlmann said the Army National Guard is in the process of erecting two temporary internment facilities on the outskirts of Morton County where detainees will be held pending the pipelines completion. Citing the need for operational security, Dohlmann declined to specify the exact location of the internment facilities.\nThe decision by the Obama administration comes at a time when clashes between demonstrators and local authorities have reached an all-time high. On Thursday, the Morton County Sheriffs Department announced that a six-hour long police operation targeting a Dakota Access protest site near Backwater Bridge resulted in the arrests of approximately 141 demonstrators.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "President Barack Obama will exercise his executive powers on Monday when he signs an executive order issuing a temporary suspension of habeas corpus..."}

In response to a question regarding his policy on ISIS, Republican presidential candidate and billionaireDonald Trump told Meet the Press on Sunday that as Commander-in-Chief, he would authorize the use of nuclear weapons to combat Islamic extremism. Lets face it, these people are barbarians, Trump said. And thanks to Obamas failed policy in Iraq and Syria, theyre beheading Christians all over the world.\nMr. Trump said hes already conferred with a number of high-level active military officials and has put together a comprehensive strategy to defeat the Islamic State within his first one hundred days in office. It starts with the deployment of four or five of our Ohio-class nuclear submarines to the Persian Gulf, Trump said. Were going to hit them and were going to hit them hard. Im talking about a surgical strike on these ISIS stronghold cities using Trident missiles.\nThe Trident is a submarine-launched ballistic missile equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles, or MIRVs. With a payload of up to fourteen reentry vehicles, each carrying a 362-pound thermonuclear warhead with a yield of 100 kilotons, a single Trident has roughly seventy times the destructive power of the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945.\nTrumps plan to use thermonuclear weapons against ISIS-held areas such as the Syrian city of Al-Raqqahwould result in an astronomically high number of civilian casualties, according to CNN military analyst Peter Mansoor. Al-Raqqah alone has a population of over two hundred-thousand people, the vast majority of whom are not affiliated in any way with the Islamic State, Mansoor said. A strike of this magnitude would not only result in the loss of millions of innocent lives and infrastructure, but it would set diplomacy and stability in the region back at least a hundred years.\nCivilian casualties are an unfortunate reality of war according to Trump, who justified the use of nuclear weapons saying they send a clear message to those who conspire against America and her allies. Mr. Trump said that unlike past and present administrations, he possesses the moral fortitude to do what must be done to protect America. Were losing to China. Were losing to Mexico. We will not lose to ISIS, Trump said.\nThe Japanese and other nations called for increased restrictions on nuclear weapons Sunday as the world observed the 70th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. The bombings, which forced Japan to surrender from the war, left over 200,000 dead.", "section": "Politics", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Donald Trump told Meet the Press on Sunday that as Commander-in-Chief, he would authorize the use of nuclear weapons to combat Islamic extremism."}

The Virginia Department of Transportation has approved a $491.5 million plan to install bicycle-friendly lanes along portions of I-495 and I-95 in Northern Virginia and parts of the Washington metropolitan area, a spokesperson for VDOT announced on Tuesday.\nThe fact of the matter is that we as a society are becoming increasingly eco-conscious and passionate about preserving our environment and as a result, more and more people are seeking out non-motorized transportation as a means of travel, Ned Meeks, the projects lead developer, told the Washington Business Journal. Right now, we have no real means of streamlining long-distance travel for the tens of thousands of people who rely on bicycles as their primary mode of transportation.\nAn avid cyclist and Share the Road advocate, Meeks vision for the Capital Beltway will become a reality in the coming months. At a cost to taxpayers of less than half a billion dollars, the project will involve expanding portions of the Beltway to allow for a 1.5 meter-wide path between the outside lane and shoulder where cyclists can travel at high speeds alongside the flow of motor vehicle traffic.\nIn an effort to remain below the already steep budget, Meeks said developers decided to scrap the more aesthetic features of the bike lane such as a protective barrier that would serve to separate cyclists from the highway. Generally speaking, this is something that youre more likely to see in an urban environment, Meeks said, continuing, From the beginning we approached this project from a minimalist viewpoint. You arent going to see a lot of unnecessary elements like illumination lights, protective barriers, or rest areas. This is purely a means of long distance rapid transportation.\nVDOT officials say construction for the Capital Beltway bike lane is set to commence on February 6th. Commuters should expect delays and exercise caution, particularly while driving along the highways twenty-two mile stretch in Northern Virginia where construction crews will be present day and night expanding the road and laying down paint.\nWhile the project is only expected to take about a month to complete, Meeks said his mission is far from over. The two-time triathlon winner turned visionary developer hopes more states will adopt similar high-speed bike lanes along their highways.In order to fully embrace this idea that bicyclists and motorists can share the road together, the biking community must have access to all roads  regardless of size and traffic flow, Meeks argued. Otherwise, the quest for transportation equality will never be achieved.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "FALLS CHURCH, Va. - The Virginia Department of Transportation has approved a $491.5 million plan to install bicycle-friendly lanes along portions of I-495.."}

A new Fox News poll conducted during President Obamas farewell address on Tuesday shows that nearly 37% of American voters would adhere to a monarchy-style government under Barack Obama. As a monarch, Mr. Obama would command total power and authority over the United States for life or until abdication.\nWhats interesting about this is it really shows you the immense impact President Obama has made on the lives of ordinary Americans over the last eight years, remarked Martha MacCallum, co-host ofAmerican Newsroom,which airs 9 AM  11 AM EST on Fox News. MacCallum noted that of the 37% in favor, a startling 16% said they would strongly prefer a repressive monarchy under Obama over a constitutional republic under Trump.\nFurther, a large fraction of American voters said theyd be willing to sacrifice certain basic freedoms and rights in order to support an Obama monarchy. Of the options provided, 57% favored relinquishing at least half of their annual income to the monarchy. Meanwhile, 25% of those surveyed said they could do without the right to own firearms if it would please the monarchy and 18% would be willing to give up their right to own land.\nThe poll, which surveyed 1,039 randomly selected registered voters nationwide, suggests that many Americans are fed up with politics as usual in the United States. If weve learned anything from this election, its that people are sick of the status quo, saidBreitbart News Networks chief political analyst Dr. Elliot Stabler.

More than 43,000 worshipers were in attendance at Lakewood Church Saturday evening when Joel Osteen, Lakewoods Senior Pastor, reportedly levitated nearly ten feet above the stage following the conclusion of his sermon. People were hysterical, said Maya Rodriguez, who, like thousands of others in the Houston area, attends weekly services at the nondenominational megachurch.\nWitnesses say roughly forty-five minutes into the 7 P.M. service, Pastor Osteen suddenly appeared disoriented before suffering a violent coughing fit. His forehead and neck were just drenched in sweat, said Colton Bradshaw, a Houston native, who was seated with his wife in the second row. The events that followed, according to Bradshaw and corroborated by more than a thousand other witnesses, left worshipers feeling perplexed and, in many cases, terrified.\nOsteen reportedly fell to his knees on stage while clutching his chest. We thought he was having a heart attack, Bradshaw said. It was then that the charismatic pastor outstretched his arms, threw his head back, and violently arched his back. Dozens of cellphone videos taken by parishioners and uploaded to the popular media website YouTube show Pastor Osteen, seemingly in a trance-like state, rise from the stage. Screams and cries of disbelief from the congregation can be heard as Osteen levitates more than nine feet off the ground.\nIn one of the higher quality videos uploaded to YouTube by userTheChristianBlessing,Osteen can be seen hovering above the stage with his head slumped forward before, as one witness put it, suddenly awakening. As Pastor Osteen appears to hang with his arms outstretched in midair, he opens his mouth and, in a deep, commanding voice, says, I am the Alpha and the Omega. Then, his body drops like a rag doll to the ground where he remains motionless.\nColton Bradshaws wife, Karen, along with dozens of other worshipers, fainted during the ordeal and later required medical attention, but Bradshaw himself remained alert throughout the entire spectacle, which lasted less than four minutes. When he spoke those words from the Book of Revelations, Bradshaw later recalled, It wasnt his voice that spoke them. It was not Pastor Osteen speaking. The sound of that voice reverberated through the stadium. For as long as I live, Ill never forget it.\nParamedics arrived at Lakewood Church at 8:05 P.M. and treated Osteen on the scene. The pastor suffered a mild concussion brought by the nearly ten foot free fall to the stage floor but was otherwise unhurt, save for some minor bruising to his forehead. A spokesman for the megachurch told Fox 26 Houston that Mr. Osteen has no memory of the events that occurred prior to regaining consciousness.\nDoctors and medical staff at the Texas Medical Center on Holcombe Boulevard in Houston were overwhelmed Saturday night as they treated approximately six hundred and fifty people, many of whom were in a state of shock after witnessing the event. Lakewood Church boasts one of the largest congregations in the United States and reaches an estimated 27 million people worldwide each week. In 1999, Joel Osteen replaced his father, John Osteen, who founded the church in 1959, as Senior Pastor.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Lakewood's Senior Pastor, Joel Osteen reportedly levitated nearly ten feet above the stage following the conclusion of his sermon."}

President-elect Donald J.

Hes very different from the way hes portrayed by the media and, you know, thats something I can relate to. Trump said he was surprised by exactly how much he and the Supreme Leader have in common. We both love meatloaf, Trump exclaimed. He said he eats it all the time. I said You ought to come to New York, Ill give you the best meatloaf youve ever had in your life.\nAside from sharing a love of baked ground meat, Trump and his North Korean counterpart discussed a wide range of issues including the economy, nuclear proliferation, and the reunification of North and South Korea. Trump, who repeatedly made the assertion during his campaign that more countries should have nuclear weapons, said he was willing to look into the possibility of loosening certain sanctions against the North Korean regime that might hinder the progress of its nuclear program. If they had that nuclear threat, Im sure it would be very good thing in terms of helping to unify the Korean peninsula, the president-elect said.\nFor his part, Mr. Trump said he offered praise for North Koreas single-party political system. I told him it was a very impressive thing to have such a successful political party that has lasted so long in that country. During his nearly two-hour long conversation with the Supreme Leader, Mr. Trump expressed an interest in implementing a similar single-party system in the United States as part of his effort to unite the country.

A British man who was abducted in early 2011 while on holiday in Blackpool has been reunited with his family after five long years in captivity thanks to the valiant efforts of theVkingasveitin, or Viking Squad, Icelands elite counter-terrorism force. A specialized unit within the group known as Echo Squad, which excels at aircraft hijacking and surprise assault operations, staged a daring nighttime rescue operation last week, Icelands largest newspaper,Frttablai,reported on Friday.\nAccording to the National Commissioner of Icelandic Police, forty-eight year-old Jack Davies of Glasgow was one of five hostages held captive by a heavily armed group led by a man known only as Father Kristmas. Icelandic authorities say the cult had been living in a subterranean cave on the island of Elliaey. As stated by Davies during a post-rescue debriefing, several dozen dwarfs armed with Kalashnikov rifles stood guard while their captives were forced to work nearly twenty hours a day making toys.\nWe were kept underground and made to sleep and work in a very rudimentary workshop, Davies is quoted as saying. If we inquired about water or wanted to relieve ourselves, we were beaten. Those who tried to communicate with one another were shot without question and their bodies discarded beneath a ghastly juniper tree that appeared to be decorated with human remains. Davies went on to say that as punishment, he and other hostages were often forced to sing Christmas carols until they collapsed from exhaustion.\nThe Viking Squads official spokesperson, Chief Inspector Gunnhallur Heimirsson, said that just before sunrise on August 1, a team of twelve operatives mounted a surprise amphibious assault on the island ofElliaey in an effort to rescue Davies and four others, including two Americans. The squad members were quickly met by hostile elements who engaged them with small arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades, the chief inspector said. A ninety minute gun battle ensued, resulting in the deaths of more than seventy dwarfs, many of whom were armed with red and white striped clubs, which Icelandic operatives described as lethal candy canes.\nRegrettably, all but one of the hostages died at the hands of their captors during the operation, Heimirsson said, adding that Mr. Davies had likely been spared because, prior to the raid, he had been locked inside a toy chest as punishment for failing to assemble a childs battery-powered motorcycle. Icelandic authorities took a small number of cult members into custody, however, their charismatic leader, Father Kristmas, refused to surrender and later died in a hail of bullets.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "A British man who was abducted in early 2011 while on holiday in Blackpool has been reunited with his family after five long years in captivity."}

Im pleased to announce the United States has entered into a historic agreement with Islamic State that will prevent any future attacks within our country, President Obama said.\nBeginning December 24th, in commemoration of the birth of Prophet Muhammad, our armed forces, acting on my command, will assist the Islamic State in spreading the Caliphate throughout the Middle East and western Europe, President Obama said. Ive ordered Congress to reinstate the draft and have asked our European allies to embrace the Islamic Caliphate or face a massive American-led air and ground campaign.\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Congress had authorized the reinstatement of the draft in secret last week. Effective December 1st, the Selective Service System will initiate a draft via online services to mobilize approximately eight million military-aged men and women from across the United States, thus creating the largest standing army on earth, Senator McConnell told C-SPAN.\nPentagon spokesperson Admiral David C. Weathers announced during a press conference in Washington, that if selected, draftees will have seventy-two hours to report for duty at their nearest military facility. If you attempt to dodge the draft, Admiral Weathers warned, you will be designated an enemy combatant and forfeit your rights as a citizen of this country and those entitled to you under the Geneva Conventions.\nOn the domestic front, President Obama has authorized Congress to reallocate funds meant for the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to the newly created Islamic Assimilation Agency (IAA) which will oversee the construction and operation of 1,305 state-of-the-art mosques throughout the United States. Weve elected to open a minimum of three per congressional district, the president said.\nIn addition, the House Committee on Ways and Means, the federal governments chief tax-writing committee, will institute a new 7% tax on goods and services beginning January 1, 2016.

The Obama Foundation, a nonprofit corporation tasked with overseeing the design and construction of President Barack Obamas presidential library, has released a preliminary set of blueprints detailing the sprawling repository meant to house important papers, records, and other historical items related to the 44th President of the United States.\nSet in Chicagos historic Jackson Park, the site of the 1893 Worlds Fair, the Obama Presidential Center has an estimated budget of $900 million and was designed as a more modern and elegant version of the KumsusanPalace of the Sun in Pyongyang, North Korea, according to Reginald Lee, a Chicago-based architect with firsthand knowledge of the project.\nThe immense presidential library is the first of its kind to be constructed entirely out of Italian marble. Its main hall, aptly named the Grand Hall, boasts a vaulted glass ceiling reaching upwards of ninety feet at its peak. With a capacity to accommodate up to two thousandfour hundred visitors, the Grand Hall will feature four prominently displayed twenty-foot tall solid gold statues depicting President Obama, the First Lady, and their two children, Malia and Natasha.\nThe Obama Foundation is expected to maintain much of the greenery already present on the five hundred acre park and, according to Lee, plans to further expand the greenspace to include community gardens and a wide moat around the perimeter. We felt the presence of a moat would serve to offer a sense of great significance to the library itself while keeping unwanted visitors  such as protesters or vandals  out, Lee explained.\nUnlike other U.S. presidential facilities, the Obama Presidential Center will also include a subterranean mausoleum constructed of twenty-inch thick blast-resistant steel where, upon his passing, the 44th President of the United States will be laid to rest surrounded by mementos and awards highlighting his numerous achievements.\nThis is something President Obama has been quite insistent on, said Lee, who met with the President last week to finalize plans for the center. Lee told Real News Right Now that upon his death, President Obamas body will embalmed and placed inside a glass sarcophagus where it will remain on display in the centers Grand Hall for one year, after which it will be permanently relocated to the mausoleum.

The Chinese government announced Sunday that it will provide funding to Planned Parenthood, a womens health organization which the U.S. House of Representatives voted last week to defund. Li Bin, who heads Chinas National Health and Family Planning Commission, said China will contribute $528 million to Planned Parenthood for the 2016 fiscal year in exchange for the continued donation of tissue samples which China plans to apply towards stem cell research.\nChina is committed to working towards a better future, not just for the Chinese people but for all people around the world, Li said. It is for this reason we have entered into a partnership with Planned Parenthood. It is not Chinas intention to meddle in Americas political affairs, but nonetheless a womans right to medical treatment should not be jeopardized by the ever-changing political climate.\nIn accordance with the agreement, Planned Parenthood will ship fetal tissue samples to several Chinese biomedical research and testing facilities on a monthly basis. Chinese scientists will then use the fetal tissue for a variety of medical related experiments including stem cell research and cloning. China is committed to the advancement of human life through medical research, Li said.\nThe Chinese government provides abortion services to women upon request except for the purpose of sex-selection, a method by which an expectant mother terminates the fetus based on the predicted sex of the child. China has historically used abortion as a means for population control and although the government doesnt make public the exact number of abortions conducted annually, in 2008 it was estimated that the government performed approximately 13 million abortions. By comparison, there were an estimated 1.2 million abortions in the United States in 2008, amounting to roughly 2% of the female population.\nPlanned Parenthood came under fire recently amid allegations that the non-profit organization had been profiting off of the sale of fetal body parts. As a result, lawmakers introduced the Defund Planned Parenthood Act of 2015, which passed the House last week but conservative lawmakers are skeptical as to whether it will successfully pass a Senate vote. Republican congressmen may decide to attach a Planned Parenthood defunding measure to an upcoming federal budget bill which could jeopardize the federal governments ability to remain operational.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "China announced Sunday that it will help fund Planned Parenthood in exchange for tissue donations."}

Given to the Israelites by God himself at Mount Sinai, the Commandments include instructions for worship and list several prohibited practices.\nPope Francis said Christians around the world are faced with ever-increasing temptations brought on by the evils of modern society. The Pope said the updated Commandments reflect the changing times and include some minor rewording of the existing rules as well as the addition of two new Commandments.\nThe Fourth Commandment, which advocates that proper respect be shown towards ones parents, has been reworded in order to include children raised by same-sex parents. Pope Francis said the Seventh Commandment, prohibiting adultery and, among other things, homosexuality, has been removed entirely, as instructed by God, in order to extend Gods grace to all His children.\nAddressing the inclusion of the new Commandments, which bring the total number to eleven, Pope Francis praised the rapid growth of technology in the digital age but said progress comes at a price. The new Fifth Commandment, which replaces the prohibition of adultery, forbids all aspects of genetic engineering and bans the consumption of genetically modified foods.\nLastly, the Eleventh Commandment disallows personal idolization and the glorification of ones self over God. Using the Kardashians, a highly publicized celebrity family, as an example, Pope Francis said, Selfies are an abomination in the eyes of our Lord.\nA spokesman for the Vatican, Father Federico Lombardi, said the Eleven Commandments are currently being etched into marble by an Italian sculptor and, upon completion, will be unveiled to the world in Saint Peters Square following an internationally televised mass.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Pope Francis announced to Christians around the world that God had instructed him to \"rewrite the Ten Commandments.\""}

Less than forty-eight hours after Hillary Clinton nearly collapsed while attempting to leave a ceremony in New York honoring the victims of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, the Democratic presidential nominees personal physician revealed that Mrs. Clinton has been found to have extremely high levels of a chemical known as dihydrogen monoxide in her system.\nPrior to [Clintons] pneumonia diagnosis, we ran a series of tests to determine her overall health, Dr. Raymond Davis, Clintons primary care provider, said during an appearance onGood Morning America on Tuesday. What weve learned from those tests is that Mrs. Clintons body weight is currently made up of nearly 68% dihydrogen monoxide. The startling revelation comes at a time when Clinton has once again found herself in the spotlight for failing to disclose important details surrounding her health.\nLike the toxic chemical ricin, dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO) occurs naturally and can be found in a number of industrial products including pesticides, solvents, and Styrofoam. This is something that can have extremely adverse effects on the human body, Dr. Davis explained. When handled improperly, dihydrogen monoxide has the ability to inflict severe burns. Further, a study conducted by the World Health Organization shows an estimated 370,000 people are killed annually as a result of dihydrogen monoxide inhalation.\nThe question now is how on earth Secretary Clinton was able to ingest this much DHMO in the first place, questioned Fox News contributor Dr. Marc Siegel. The obvious answer is this is yet another example of a complete and total lack of transparency on part of the Clinton campaign, Siegel continued. And to pull a stunt of this magnitude on the anniversary of 9/11; I cant think of a bigger insult to the American people.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Raymond Davis told Good Morning America that his office was specifically asked by Clintons campaign manager not to leak the DHMO report to the media.

According to a new report scheduled for public release this weekby the Government Accountability Office, President Obamas bathroom breaks may have cost U.S. taxpayers just over $4 billion in 2015. Data provided to the GAO by the Obama administration shows that on average, President Barack Obama took 3.5 bathroom breaks a day last year, with each trip to the toilet lasting four minutes or less.\nBy the GAOs estimate, the commander-in-chief spent just over eighty-five hours in the bathroom in 2015 alone. The question on everyones mind when they look at a report like this is, What exactly is he doing in there?' Wondered Republican senator John McCain. The former POW admitted toC-SPAN that he goes to the bathroom about once a day on a good day.\nEven so, the Arizona senator cited a particularly disturbing quote from the report stating that on October 23rd, the day former secretary of state Hillary Clinton was scheduled to testify before the House Select Committee on Benghazi, President Obama took a record-breaking twenty-one minute bathroom break. I think its very telling, Senator McCain said.\nThe average adult male uses the restroom anywhere from three times a day to once every three days, said Dr. Deepak Gupta, a senior scatologist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore. Ideally we see about one ounce of stool per every twelve pounds of body weight, Dr. Gupta explained, continuing, With that said, President Obama -who weighs about one hundred eighty pounds, should produce about fifteen ounces of solid fecal matter per bowel movement.\nHowever, Dr. Gupta pointed out that due to unusually high levels of stress associated with the job of running the country, President Obama likely produces well below average stools. In all probability, the guy is a stool softener addict, Dr. Gupta toldReal News Right Now.\nDespite President Obamas low performance rating in the bathroom, the GAO estimates he still uses an above-average amount of toilet paper and -if hes a courtesy flusher, as White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest once hinted, he uses at least twice as much water per visit to the mens room as the average American. This, coupled with the obvious breaks in productivity, has cost taxpayers a whopping $4.1 billion.\nThis is simply unacceptable, Florida senator and GOP presidential candidate Marco Rubio told Real News Right Now. This is the kind of imprudent overzealous spending that I intend to do away with. Senator Rubio said he and other Republican congressmen -in an effort to save taxpayers a buck or two, often wear adult diapers while on Capitol Hill. Its uncomfortable but from a moral standpoint, its the right thing to do. We as elected officials owe that much to our constituents.", "section": "Politics", "content_type": "article", "desc": "According to a new report by the Government Accountability Office, President Obama's bathroom breaks cost U.S. taxpayers just over $4 billion in 2015."}

The lieutenant colonel said he had been authorized to provide the Philippine News Agency (PNA) with exclusive access to the centers cleansing rooms, three two-story windowless warehouses  each outfitted with its own state-of-the-art crematorium  where drug users will undergo rehabilitation seminars.\nBecause there are so many drug addicts in the Philippines, we are limited to three bullets per addict, said Reeinald before continuing, I tell my men, If you cannot kill them with three bullets, you will have to find another way. Fortunately for Reeinald and his officers, President Duterte is offering a hefty bounty to any law enforcement officer who personally takes the life of an individual caught in the act of buying or selling antihistamines and other drugs. Strike them down where they stand, Duterte demanded during recent press conference. Use a gun or a knife, I dont care. Burn their homes to the ground and leave them for the dogs.\nPresident Rodrigo Duterte, who recently likened himself to Adolf Hitler, has come under fire from the United States for his ambitious desire to exterminate an estimated three million drug users by the summer of 2017.

Were going to eliminate the red tape and its going to give police the ability to do their jobs effectively and, believe me, this is something thats going to happen within my first one hundred days in office.\nUnder Trumps plan, city and state police departments would fall under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security and would therefore be granted broad authorities to enforce the law. Theyre going to receive the best weapons, training, and resources this country has to offer, Trump promised. Were going to put an end to jurisdictional restrictions and increase police capabilities in terms of surveillance and the use of deadly force. Not only that, were going to eliminate this so-called standard for probable cause; its very limiting and, frankly, outdated. Our police forces are going to have much more freedom in terms of who they can arrest and why.\nTrump compared his proposal for a federalized police force to similar operations in countries like Brazil and Mexico where armor-clad federal police are able to travel freely between cities and counties and have the support of military-grade vehicles and weaponry. Its going to be very similar to what you see in Rio de Janeiro where they have a very serious gang problem, Trump explained.

An Amber Alert was called off Friday afternoon after police arrested a child predator who led them on a fifty mile high-speed chase that spanned two states and left eleven people, including four police officers, dead.\nIt all began Friday morning when Carla Menendez, a third grade teacher at New Castle Elementary School, noticed her student, eight-year old Kyle Jefferson, was absent from class. School officials contacted Kyles parents, Tom and Eileen Jefferson, who said the last theyd seen or heard from their son had been when he boarded a county school bus just an hour before. It was then that school officials notified the New Castle Country Police Department, who issued an Amber Alert for Kyle Jefferson.\nAt approximately 10:05 a.m. New Castle police received a call from a concerned citizen who spotted the young Kyle Jefferson near The Home Depot on Sunset Boulevard. Officers were en route to The Home Depot when a dispatcher notified them that the silent alarm had been triggered nearby at the Citizens Bank on North Dupont Highway.\nPolice arrived on the scene to find mild-manneredKyle Jefferson exiting Citizens Bank, with his backpack -whichappeared to be stuffed with cash-around his shoulders, while brandishing a Uzi submachine gun. Before police could intervene, Kyle, who came in Second Place in his schools science fair this year, opened fire on the officers vehicles. In the ensuing chaos, young Kyle Jefferson was able to hijack a New Castle Police cruiser and flee the scene.\nMoments later additional units were in pursuit of the stolen police car as it traveled south on Dupont Highway while weaving in and out of traffic. Miraculously, the unassuming eight-year-old was able to shoot out the tires of the lead police car, causing it to veer off the road into a Sunocogas station where it struck a fuel line and exploded. The resulting fire destroyed five nearby businesses, including the Sunoco, and left seven people dead.\nShortly after passing the Maryland-Delaware state line, the youthful Kyle Jeffersons commandeered police car encountered a roadblock set up by Maryland State Troopers. Upon hitting a spike strip at one hundred miles per hour, Kyles front tires were torn apart causing the vehicle to flip over roughly nine times before coming to a rest on the median. Officers rushed the vehicle, taking the child, who was remarkably unharmed, into custody. Kyle Jefferson, who officers described as extremely polite, was found to have a fully automatic Uzi submachine gun, $2,500 in cash, and a two-pound bag of lollipops in his possession.\nHes just never done anything like this before in his life, said Eileen Jefferson, Kyles mother, who, like many others in New Castle County, spoke very highly of her son. Mrs. Jefferson believes Kyle may have become overly excited after playing the video game Grand Theft Auto V at a friends house earlier in the week. Its the only possible explanation I can think of, she said.

Once the smoke settled, police moved in to survey the scene and, in the process, discovered a small amount of marijuana approximately sixty yards from the vehicles wreckage. Officers determined the contraband had come from Mr. Hamiltons vehicle, Cerreta said. Mr. Hamilton was immediately taken into custody and charged with possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute.\nThe decision by Cleveland police to use the bomb disposal robot comes less than a week after police in Dallas, Texas, used a similar robot to end a tense standoff with a suspect who had allegedly shot and killed five police officers and wounded seven others.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Police in Cleveland, Ohio, used a bomb robot to conduct a search of a vehicle during a traffic stop over the weekend, a spokesperson for the..."}

According to the World Health Organization, a colony consisting of more than one billion Africanized cicadas is terrorizing the worlds second largest continent.\nThere are currently more than thirteen hundred different types of cicadas on earth with many species existing since at least 1558 B.C. However, according to leading entomologists working in Africa and parts of Australia, a new breed of cicadas, commonly referred to as the Africanized Cicadidae, pose a significant and imminent threat to the worlds ecosystems.\nLast month the South Sudanese government reported that a swarm of nearly four million Africanized Cicadas brought down two commercial airliners shortly after they took off from Juba Airport. Unlike other more well-known species of cicada, the Africanized species has a hardened exoskeleton that serves as a permanent suit of armor, protecting it from extreme weather and predators. According to theSouth Sudan News Agency, a dense cloud of insects flew into the jets engines causing them to explode mid-flight. In all, seven hundred and thirty-six passengers and crew perished.\nThis is not something to be taken lightly, said Dr. Jens Larsen. These are essentially fifty caliber bullets with wings. Dr. Larsen, who heads the World Health Organizations Incident Response Team, said Africanized Cicadas can travel at speeds of up to eighty-five kilometers an hour and have been known to penetrate car windshields and windows with surprising ease.\nEntire villages have been wiped out by this species of cicada, Dr. Larsen said, adding that officials initially believed many victims had been executed by anti-government forces but subsequent autopsies revealed that the Africanized insects had quite literally dive-bombed their targets, killing many of them instantly. Due to their unusually hardened exterior, this species is very capable of punching through a persons chest cavity or skull with alarming force.\nAccording to the WHO, the Africanized Cicada has killed more than 21,800 people in Sub Saharan Africa since 2015. Now, officials say, the killer insects are migrating west towards Central America. Probably the most surprising aspect about the Africanized Cicada is its unique ability to mate and reproduce mid-flight, Dr. Larsen said. This presents a serious problem in that their numbers have the potential to triple or even quadruple by the time they reach the Central American mainland.\nTo make matters worse, Africanized Cicadas have proven to be highly resilient and are immune to most pesticides and other forms of repellent. According to what weve seen, and what weve been told by the Sudan Peoples Liberation Army, direct exposure to fire is the only viable method for killing these things, Dr. Larsen explained.\nThe World Health Organization on Sunday issued a regional alert for Central America and parts of the eastern United States advising government and public health officials to make preparations for a worst-case scenario. The WHO estimates that more than four billion Africanized Cicadas are expected to descend on the continental United States as early as June of this year.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "According to the WHO, a colony consisting of more than one billion Africanized cicadas is terrorizing the world's second largest continent."}

Trump said he is considering using a litmus-style test  rather than a lottery  to determine which Americans will be selected for sterilization.\nThe U.N. acknowledged that in order to reduce the earths population by an estimated 420 million people in time for the proposed thirty-year deadline, poorer countries that lack sufficient means to carry out compulsory sterilizations will have to seek out more archaic methods in an effort to meet their quota.

Retired U.S. Air Force General Buck Turgidson, who worked with the National Security Agency from 1999 until late 2005, has intimate knowledge regarding the circumstances surrounding Zuckerbergs employment.\nHe was a senior architect of the PRISM program, he stated during a interview last week on Fox & Friends. General Turgidson went on to say that Facebook was designed as an extension of PRISM in that it created massive data gathering capabilities. It revolutionized the way we gather information on a large scale, meanwhile bypassing federal surveillance laws because users make the choice to voluntarily give up personal information.\nAccording to classified NSA documents leaked by former employee and whistle-blower Edward Snowden and later released to the American public by journalist Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept, Zuckerberg met regularly with top U.S. intelligence officials in closed-door sessions. However, the details of these sessions were never recorded. In an email response to questions submitted by this reporter, Facebooks Public Relations director April O. Neel confirmed that Mr. Zuckerberg attends biweekly sessions at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade strictly as a pro bono consultant.\nIf true, these allegations could explain why in March of last year, Facebook requisitioned a secure, climate controlled, server storage facility roughly the size of two football fields at the Utah Data Center, a massive data mining complex operated by the National Security Agency.\nGeneral Turgidson, who agreed to meet with this reporter at an undisclosed location yesterday, defended the PRISM program as well as Facebooks alleged involvement, citing national security concerns amid an ever growing age of technology. He called the clear invasion of privacy necessary and added, Its no secret that Facebook openly employs the use of surveillance technology, whether it be global positioning services or facial recognition software. The public is aware of it and they accept it. Its right there in the Terms of Service.\nOvershadowed by these groundbreaking allegations against Zuckerberg is the mysterious disappearance of Facebook intern James Olsen. Olsen, who accepted a post-college internship with the social media company late last year, posted a cell phone video he took during a staff meeting at Facebook headquarters in which Zuckerberg can be heard allegedly shouting, Privacy is not a right, its a privilege! The video was uploaded to the media sharing site YouTube on January 5th, 2015, however it was pulled by the site less than four hours later.\nA programmer currently working for Facebook, who spoke to this reporter on the condition of anonymity, said he witnessed plain clothes security officers armed with handguns forcibly remove Olsen from Facebook headquarters.

During a high-profile visit to the United States this week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed members of the pro-Israel lobby, imploring them to foster support among Congress to relocate the Palestinian people to the state of Wyoming. In doing so, Netanyahu told a packed ballroom, the move would serve to strengthen U.S.-Israeli relations while significantly reducing tensions between Israel and its neighbors.\nAccording to Netanyahu, the plan to move approximately 6.08 million Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank could be accomplished in under three years, with Palestinians making the journey aboard chartered container ships, dramatically reducing transportation costs for U.S. taxpayers. In the meantime, Israel would continue to expand its settlements into previously occupied areas.\nIsrael has always enjoyed the support and friendship of the United States, Netanyahu said. However, true friends support each other in times of need. Should the United States fail to assist us in the relocation process, it would put an irreversible rift on U.S.-Israeli relations and jeopardize the safety and security of the Jewish State. The prime minister added that should the U.S. neglect to act, it would show an unequivocal lack of commitment to the Mideast peace process.\nThis reporter spoke with Herschel Krustovski, a representative of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee, who has been working with officials from the Israeli government to lay the groundwork for the relocation process. We found Wyoming to be the best possible location for a number of reasons. First, it is sparsely populated; second, despite the climate not being that of the Middle East, the terrain bears a striking resemblance to Israel. We feel that will help the Palestinian people during the adjustment process.\nWyoming state legislature seemed optimistic about the economic value a Palestinian relocation would bring. Republican State Senator John Marston, who attended this weeks policy conference at AIPAC and met privately with Netanyahu, said, Were all in agreement that not only does this move benefit Israel, but also the great state of Wyoming. We have a rich history of agriculture and mineral production in our state and the influx of the Palestinian people would provide a significant boost in our economy that I believe would benefit the entire nation.\nShould the United States decide to accept the Palestinian people, Senator Marston says Wyoming will welcome them with open arms. Ive already spoken with members of our state legislature and were preparing to pass legislation that will allow us to combine Weston, Niobrara, and Goshen counties into one, thereby creating a suitable home for the Palestinian people.\nThe central purpose of Prime Minister Netanyahus trip to the United States this week was a scheduled appearance before Congress meant to dissuade American involvement in a proposed U.S.-Iran nuclear deal.

Due to the Potomacs often murky waters, Blatter said his boats frequently circle the shallow waters off the coast of Roosevelt Island where the bull sharks have been known to hang out.\nHowever, as a result of increased boat traffic on the Potomac, some tour boat operators are turning to a process known as chumming to lure sharks away from Roosevelt Island and into other shallow areas of the river. Illegal in some parts of the world because of the increased risk it poses to humans, chumming is the act of using a mixture of blood, bone, and fish parts to lure sharks into a specific area.\nWe dont typically encourage chumming because of its adverse effects on marine life, Blatter said. Now having said that, we offer a special excursion on Sundays which is geared toward more experienced swimmers. We hit the water before sunrise and head over to a little rock cluster known as the Three Sisters where it gets to be around forty feet deep. We put you in a diving cage and drop you ten or twelve feet down with about thirty gallons of chum, explainedBlatter, adding, Its a really unique experience.\nBull sharks, which can grow to nearly eight feet in length, are the only known species of shark that can survive in both fresh and saltwater. Highly aggressive towards humans, they usually thrive in warm shallow water and are responsible for the vast majority of near-shore shark attacks.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Shark enthusiasts are flocking to the nation's capital this summer to catch a glimpse of several dozen bull sharks which have migrated further inland..."}

Nicknamed The Official Escort Of The Jihad, the company is already reporting huge profits in countries like Iraq, Syria, and Libya.\nSimilar to American companies like Uber and Lyft, users can gain access to the car service simply by logging into the VieBied app through their smartphones. Using GPS, the app lets users know which vehicles are available within a desired radius of their location. Payment is made upon delivery using a third-party Bitcoin service.\nWe offer our clients three pricing tiers, Bin Talal told the Washington Business Journal. Our lowest and most popular option is a compact car or sedan containing roughly five kilograms of plastic explosives in the trunk. From there, prices and vehicle size increase significantly. The third tier option is a box truck packed with five hundred kilograms of ammonium nitrate fuel oil and fertilizer, which, according to the VieBied app is enough to level a five-story apartment building.\nThis is a really impressive business model, says CNNMoney contributor Michael De Santa. Definitely one of the better ideas to come out of the Middle East in the last quarter-century. Potential investors are keeping a watchful eye on VeBied should the company eventually decide to go public. Theyve really managed to capitalize on Mid East consumerism here, De Santa says.\nBin Talal says the company is working to expand its operations in 2016 by adding more vehicle options, including pickups with mounted machine guns and flatbed trucks sporting anti-aircraft weaponry.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "VeBied launched in February of this year and is available exclusively in the Middle East."}

Mexican Federal Police estimate upwards of two hundred people were killed, among them women and children. At least a dozen others are reported missing.\nA journalist affiliated with Blog Del Narco, which chronicles the Mexican drug war, told the El Paso Times he witnessed six Toyota style pickup trucks, some with mounted machine guns, seal off a portion of Federal Highway 45 before occupants got out and began firing indiscriminately into traffic. The massacre lasted for a heart-pounding fifteen minutes and ended with twenty-six dead and at least sixty more who were wounded in the attack. According to one witness there were bodies everywhere.\nMexican Federal Police speculate the attack was meant to divert attention away from a larger strike that took place less than an hour later. Commissary General Mariano Lopez of the Federal Police, speaking with reporters Monday afternoon, said approximately sixty officers responded to reports of gunfire coming from a compound just two miles east of Federal Highway 45. The compound, which Mexican authorities say was a drug distribution center operated by Mexicos largest and most dangerous criminal organization, the Sinaola cartel, had been under surveillance by the military in conjunction with the countrys anti-drug efforts.\nCommissary General Lopez said during the press briefing that upon arrival police forces were met with heavy gunfire coming from inside the compound. Initially we thought these are cartel members or Los Zetas trying to kill us, he said. Federal Police sent in reinforcements including a tactical team on board two Black Hawk helicopters, one of which was shot down by what authorities believe was a shoulder-fired rocket launcher. Thirteen Federal Police Officers were killed in crash.\nIn what could be an embarrassing admission for the Federal Police, Commissary General Lopez told reporters, We were completely overwhelmed. Police were forced to retreat from the compound due to a lack of readily available resources in the area. Lopez explained that his agency is well equipped to take on drug traffickers, having received training from top law enforcement agencies in the United States, however we do not have the resources to take on well-trained foreign fighters.\nMexicos president, Enrique Pena Nieto, has requested U.S. assistance in dealing with ISIS, saying in a televised address to the country, We cannot meet this threat alone.

Were not going to have Muslims buying firearms in this country and Ill tell you why: they cant be trusted. The former reality TV star said Muslims currently living in the United States  including those who are U.S. citizens  need to be vetted to ensure they havent been radicalized in one form or another by the Islamic State.\nI dont care if theyve been living in this country for five years or for twenty-five years, Trump said, adding. And believe me, we know who they are. They may think we dont but we know exactly who they are. And this is very backwards but these people follow their religion very closely and I will tell you that getting their hands on an AK-47 is considered a rite of passage in Islam.\nTrump further expanded on his call to ban Muslims from migrating to the United States, saying that as president he would order Muslim American gun owners to turn their firearms over to the government or face immediate deportation or imprisonment. We cannot continue to allow these people, many of whom share the same savage beliefs as the Orlando killer, to get their hands on firearms.\nTrump later blasted President Obama for costing taxpayers billions of dollars by allowing what he called a tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the country. Hes already let two hundred and fifty-thousand of these people and folks, we have no idea who they are  but hes let them into this country and now Hillary, who not only wants to confiscate guns, is now shes saying she wants to increase the number of refugees by five hundred and fifty percent.", "section": "Politics", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Republican presidential nominee Donald J.

The international furniture designer and retail conglomerate known as IKEA officially announced this week that beginning July 1st, a new line of defense oriented products will be available for purchase through its website and select retail outlets around the world. IKEA, best known for its line of furniture and home accessories, first unveiled its new product line in February at the International Defence Expedition & Conference, otherwise known as IDEX, at the Abu Dhabi Exhibition Centre in the United Arab Emirates.\nFlanked by veteran defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, representatives from IKEAs Defense Research & Analytics Group presented potential consumers with their signature line of ready-to-assemble defensive combat products. From mobile anti-aircraft systems to compact tactical carbines, IKEA displayed an uncanny ability to integrate their existing sales mantra into the defense and security industry.\nAt IKEA we have a slogan, You do a little. We do a little. And together we save a lot,' Mayda Sorenson told prospective buyers during a live-fire demonstration of the Ready-To-Assemble Personal Defense Weapon, a compact assault rifle designed for special operations forces. The RTA-PDW can be easily assembled in a high-stress situation, even by an inexperienced operator, in under eight minutes, Sorenson explained, adding that every product, including the RTA-PDW, comes packaged with user-friendly assembly instructions in twelve languages, including English, French, Arabic, and Chinese. At IKEA we believe in providing quality products at an affordable price, Sorenson said before demonstrating the RTA-PDWs burst-fire capabilities on a practice dummy.\nThis reporter spoke with Lieutenant General Khurshid Rasheed of the Iraqi Armys 9th Armoured Division. Iraqs Ministry of Defence recently purchased some fifty Ready-to-Assemble T-3 Mobile Anti-Aircraft Systems from IKEA for use in their fight against the Islamic State. At a cost of less than a third of other systems, such as the Patriot Air and Missile Defense System manufactured by American defense contractor Raytheon, the T-3 performs just as well, if not better, according to General Rasheed, who said, It took some time to understand the instructions but my men were able to assemble two of these systems in just a few hours time. The General added that during assembly, his soldiers discovered a majority of the anti-aircraft systems were missing two or three required screws, but nonetheless performed exceptionally well during live-fire exercises.\nThe RTA T-3 Mobile Anti-Aircraft System and other similar products are only available for purchase online or through IKEAs corporate office. However small arms, such as the RTA-PDW and other weapons, including ready-to-assemble landmines, will be available for purchase at select IKEA outlets beginning July 1st. IKEAs Jeddah and Riyadh locations in Saudi Arabia were among the first to receive the new inventory.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "IKEA, best known for its line of furniture and home accessories, first unveiled its new product line in February at IDEX in the United Arab Emirates."}

In a rare press release, the National Security Agency on Tuesday announced it has upgraded its cyber defenses after a security breach late last year left the intelligence agency vulnerable to attack. Following an incident that occurred in November of 2015, NSA has reviewed and updated its security protocols, the agency said in a statement posted on its website.\nThe incident in question occurred just weeks before Thanksgiving on November 7, 2015, when an apparent computer glitch resulted in a sequence of highly classified nuclear launch codes, known as Gold Codes, to become embedded on the front page of the NSAs official website. According to the NSA, the codes, which are provided to the president for the purpose of authorizing a nuclear attack, were only exposed for a period of seven minutes.\nHowever, according to a high-ranking NORAD official with knowledge of the incident, hackers were still able to access the codes despite their short appearance online. Within minutes of discovering the classified data, the official told The Washington Post,a launch sequence was remotely established at a hardened missile silo located at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming. Moments later, a rouge LGM-30G Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile left its silo.\nArmed with aW87thermonuclear warhead, the ballistic missile passed over Nevada and California before plunging into the Pacific Ocean nearly two hundred miles off the coast of Southern California, where it detonated underwater. Immediately following the incident, the U.S. Navy claimed the fully armed ICBM, which was seen by hundreds of people across two states, was actually an unarmed submarine-launched Trident missile, fired as part of a planned missile test.\nThe U.S. intelligence community has yet to identify the hackers responsible for the NSAs data breach but officials are confident that with the new security protocols in place, a repeat of last Novembers mishap is unlikely to happen again, at least in the foreseeable future.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "FORT MEADE, Md. - In a rare press release, the National Security Agency announced it has upgraded its cyber defenses after a security breach late last year."}

The abominations are described as asymmetrical humans, Father Pizzarro continued. Where one has three arms and one leg, another is completely headless with eyes protruding from its shoulders.\nAccording to the ancient texts, upon seeing his abominations, God tore a hole in the earth and cast them one by one into the fires below. The fact of the matter is that this had to be kept secret  had to be erased from all official accounts  because what it means is that God is capable of mistakes. He is not  as we have been taught  infallible, Father Pizzarro said.\nPizzarro was first made aware of the texts existence in 1978 during a late night conversation with longtime friend and mentor Bishop Vincenzo Cristelli. He confided in me, recalled Father Pizzarro. He told me he had found something big and he was going to expose the Church. Eight years later, on January 8, 1986, the bishop set out to do just that. Hours before a scheduled meeting with a reporter from the Italian newspaperLa Repubblica,Bishop Cristellis bullet-ridden body was found floating in the Tiber River.\nYears later, Father Pizzarro is picking up where his friend left off. Since embarking on his crusade to expose the truth, the seventy-one year-old priest has survived three assassination attempts including a failed car bombing in Morocco; attacks which he believes were carried out by members of the Pontifical Swiss Guard, Vatican Citys de facto military force. His Holiness will stop at nothing to prevent this information from getting out, warned Father Pizzarro. I am fortunate that God is on my side.\nFather Pizzarro is expected to arrive in the United Kingdom this week where he intends to hand-deliver scanned copies of the ancient texts to a handful of international news organizations. Pizzarros arrival in the U.K. is timed to coincide with the Popes visit to Sweden.

McConnell told Chuck Todd during an appearance onMeet the Press on Sunday. The Kentucky senator went on to explain that in 2015, when he was sworn in as Senate Majority Leader, he took an oath to block every conceivable motion put forth by the Democrats while continuing to enjoy all the amenities and benefits afforded to him by American taxpayers.\nOn Monday, Senator Mitch McConnell further reaffirmed his commitment to the NRA, saying he would block any Supreme Court nominee who didnt meet the approval of the gun rights group. McConnell said the NRA, which represents a little over 1.6% of the U.S. population -coincidentally- represents 100% of his constituents.

Its better to be short a Justice than run the risk of having a liberal interpreting constitutional law on behalf of the entire country, McConnell said.\nMeanwhile, President Obama, in an interview withNPR, said he finds it puzzling that Senator McConnell and other Republicans think the American people should decide the next Supreme Court Justice.

Mexican federal police shot and killed four people who were attempting to enter the country illegally this weekend, the Tijuana-based newspaperFrontera reported Monday. The individuals, who were identified as Americans, had attempted to circumvent a Mexico-U.S. border checkpoint by scaling a fence approximately half a kilometersouth of it.\nOfficers attempted to communicate to the individuals that they were illegally entering Mexican soil, first in Spanish and then in English, said Federal Police Commander General Jose Luis Montoya. When the individuals did not comply, officers took appropriate action to prevent illegal entry.\nMexico has long struggled with an illegal migration problem at its borders, particularly in the south where migrants from other Central and South American nations frequently enter Mexico as a way-point into the United States. However, in the last decade, Mexico has seen a rise in American foot traffic, both legally and illegally, along its border with the United States.\nIts becoming a real problem for us, said prominent Mexican attorney Miguel Valdez. Americans come here and they exploit our resources and our people; they contribute to organized crime by purchasing illegal narcotics which, of course, worsens the security situation here in Mexico.\nThe Mexican government is working to pass legislation that would ban American entry into the country except in cases of diplomatic travel. Americans are rude, loud, obnoxious murders, said one man who wished to remain anonymous because he has family living across the border in San Diego. Were constantly hearing reports of killings and violence over there; its normal for them, Americans perpetuate a culture of violence. The man said he has begged his family to return to Mexico out of fear they, too, might fall victim to American violence.\nHere, of course, we have the Narcos to worry about, and so its expected they will kill people, and the government is dealing with that. But in America these people arent members of criminal gangs, theyre just regular people killing regular people. Its very frightening.\nUnlike in Mexico where firearm ownership is illegal, Americans have access to a wide array of powerful weaponry, including weapons designed for military use. Logically, it doesnt make any sense, Valdez said. Many Mexicans have expressed fear that Americans entering the country could carry out a large-scale attack in a public area.\nIn America, if someone disagrees with someone else, or they have a difference of opinion on a policy, rather than engaging in dialogue they take up arms and kill innocent people, Valdez said. Thats not how a civilized nation operates. So, naturally, we dont want these people coming into Mexico. They are a threat to our national security.\nOutside of declared war zones, America hasmore mass shootingsthan any other country on earth. Most recently, a fifty-seven year-old Caucasian man entered a womens health clinic in Colorado and began shooting.

President Barack Obama will exercise his presidential powers next week when he signs an executive order that will ban the sale and transfer of firearms to private citizens in the United States. The announcement comes less than a week after a gunman armed with a handgun and an assault rifle shot and killed forty-nine people and wounded fifty-three others at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.\nOnce enacted, the National Security and Individual Protection Act, otherwise known as E.O. 13717, will prohibit the sale or barter of firearms by licensed dealers and individual sellers to private citizens. Americans who have legally purchased firearms prior to the executive orders issue date will be permitted to keep them. Let me be clear, were not taking away anyones guns here, President Obama said on Friday. This is about keeping weapons out of the hands of dangerous people.\nThe president explained that under the new law, Americans who were once eligible to acquire firearms through legal means are still able to do so but must manufacture the weapons themselves. If you absolutely have to have a gun, I have no doubt youll find some way to build it yourself, Obama said, continuing, Its what the Founding Fathers did, its what the Minutemen did, and as a student of constitutional law, I believe there is little doubt that this iswhat they intended when they penned the Constitution.\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives director Thomas E. Brandon further explained the guidelines for manufacturing homemade firearms, saying, Prior to assembly, [individuals] must notify the BATF of their intent to manufacture such a firearm. Under the National Firearms Act you will be subjected to a mandatory $200 tax, applicable for each firearm you create, Brandon explained. This applies to even the most rudimentary rifles, pistols, and shotguns; anything that fires a projectile is subject to NFA guidelines.\nThis is quite an ingenious ploy by the Obama administration, remarked CNN political analyst Elliot Brewster. That theyve managed to pull this off without violating the Constitution in any way, shape, or form is an incredible accomplishment in and of itself. Brewster noted that President Obama has pointed out repeatedly throughout the course of his time in office that he has no intention of infringing upon the right of the American people to keep and bear arms.

There are dozens of references throughout the bible that suggest Jesus abhorred the consumption of gluten, Father Lombardi said.\nMaking an example out of Proverbs 23:2, which states that one should put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony, Father Lombardi said that Vatican scholars have spent more than eight years pouring over ancient texts in an effort to determine what link, if any, exists between gluttony and gluten in the biblical sense. The verdict, Father Lombardi said, is surprising. Gluttony and gluten are one in the same, he explained, adding that hundreds of translations over a span of nearly two thousand years have contributed to faulty and, often, misleading texts.\nThis discovery has left the Holy See with no choice but to conclude that the mere act of consuming gluten is in fact, a deadly sin, said Father Lombardi. The Holy See will -in the coming weeks, determine the best course of action for absolving the sins of the dead. By the Catholic Churchs own estimate, more than 400 million of its followers could have faced eternal damnation due to the improperly translated text.\nIn a memorandum posted on its official websiteand distributed worldwide on Saturday, the Vatican called on churches around the globe to place a temporary moratorium on the Sacrament of the Eucharist until gluten-free wafers can be distributed.

The District of Columbia has no need or want for a nuclear missile silo, let alone one right across from the National Mall, argued Mayor Bowser.\nHowever, congressional leaders disagree. The Tidal Basin is an ideal location for an underground launch facility, Senator Mitch McConnell (R-Ky) toldThe Washington Post. Were talking about providing total security to the entire eastern seaboard through nuclear deterrence. I simply cant fathom why anyone would oppose this.\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. senate granted the Department of Defense the authorization it needs to install up to five intercontinental ballistic missile silos underneath the Tidal Basin, a man-made reservoir constructed in the 1880s which separates the Washington Channel from the Potomac River. Each silo will contain an LGM-30Minuteman III ICBM, which has the capacity to carry up to three 500 kiloton warheads.\nThese rockets have a range of about eight thousand miles, so theyre more than capable of striking targets in Russia, Iran, and North Korea; or, frankly, anyone anywhere in the world who threatens the safety and security of United States for that matter, Addison Twomey, a retired Air Force colonel, told CNNs Wolf Blitzer on Wednesday.\nGOP presidential candidate and U.S. senator Ted Cruz (R-Tx), who sits on the Senate Committee on Armed Services, voiced support for the decision to install the ICBM silos, saying, Its Congresss job to decide what is best for D.C. and its residents and in this case thats what weve done. Were creating jobs and security, two things the Obama administration has  for eight years  failed to do.\nSenator Cruz believes the ICBM silos will also serve to boost tourism in Washington, D.C.

Mr. Cruz said that even if he isnt elected in November, he still plans to bring his family to Washington to carry on our tradition of strolling along the Tidal Basin and admiring the cherry blossoms, and  once theyre complete  the ballistic missile silos.\nHistorically, Minuteman III ballistic missiles have been stationed atfourU.S. Air Force bases located in North Dakota, Montana, and Wyoming.

The Bolivian military used an incendiary munition known as white phosphorousto incinerate approximately three hundred acres of rainforest along the South American countrys northeastern region last week, the Minister of National Defense announced on Friday. The area has been completely razed and we are confident all life has been extinguished, said Bolivian Defense Minister Ruben Saavadra Soto.\nThe controlled blaze was part of a concentrated effort by the Armed Forces of Bolivia to eradicate a rare species of spider that officials say is responsible for more than six hundred deaths over the last four months, with eighty-three occurring in November alone. Known as theacecho or stalking  spider, the astoundingly elusive arachnid can grow to about the size of a small dog. With fangs sharp enough to pierce body armor, the acechois capable of killing a full-grown adult within seconds of inflicting its venomous bite.\nBolivian officials blame increasingly warmer climates for the sharp rise in acechospider attacks. This species is most prevalent in areas known for moderate to frequent volcanic activity, said Jack Robinson, an Australian-born rainforest biologist and canopy researcher. Robinson and his team were hired by the Bolivian Ministry of National Defense to investigate the dangerous arachnids after seventeen Bolivian soldiers were found dead in their bunks  all having sustained puncture wounds to their upper body and torso region. Despite their size, these are highly versatile creatures, explained Robinson. I have personally observed an acechospider traverse the forest floor at speeds up to forty-eight kilometers per hour.\nIn October, Bolivias state-funded newspaperCambio reported that the countrys armed forces were trying unsuccessfully to squash out the spider population before it could spread to more heavily populated cities and towns. This is our biggest fear, Defense Minister Soto was quoted as saying. Our commanders are receiving reports from soldiers on the ground that the use of napalm is totally ineffective and only causes the spiders to scatter. Bolivia has since procured a sizable amount of white phosphorous from the United States. Despite the odds, I remain confident the Bolivian people can overcome this crisis, Soto said.\nIn addition to providing more than $53 million in military aid, U.S. President Barack Obama has authorized the deployment of up to 240 special operations troops to assist the Bolivian government in combating the arachnid threat.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "The Bolivian military used an incendiary munition known as white phosphorous to incinerate approximately three hundred acres of rainforest along....."}

A Veterans Affairs hospital in West Texas has devised an ingenious way to deal with the exceptionally long wait times suffered by many veterans seeking healthcare. Officials at the West Texas VA Medical Center in San Angelo have erected a tent city in a vacant lot adjacent to the facility where veterans with wait times of forty-five days or more can find temporary lodging.\nPresently, were operating at about forty percent capacity, John Abrams, Director of Environmental Services at the West Texas Center, told NewsWest 9, a local NBC affiliate. Abrams, who oversees day-to-day operations at the tent city, said the lot currently hosts twenty full-size disaster relief tents on loan from FEMA. Each tent has the capacity to hold about twenty-five cots, explained Abrams during a tour of the city. Right now Ive got about half a dozen Porto-Johns around back as well as a fire hydrant that we open up once a day for showers.\nIn addition to providing free housing and running water to up to five hundred veterans in need of healthcare, Adams told NewsWest 9 that the medical center has entered into an agreement with a fleet of local food trucks. They pull up every morning at 7:45 sharp and dish out meals, Adams said, adding, In fact, a couple of these drivers are vets themselves, so occasionally theyll throw in a little extra grub or offer these guys a twenty percent discount.\nTwenty-eight year-old Reginald Williams, a former staff sergeant in the U.S. Army, has spent more than three months awaiting treatment for an infection caused by injuries he sustained to his leg during two consecutive tours in Afghanistan. This place saved my life, Williams said before going on to say that his infection had become so bad in recent weeks that a fellow soldier awaiting chemotherapy, who served as a combat medic in Iraq, performed an emergency field amputation on his leg. If it wasnt for the tent city, I would have died, a grateful Williams said.\nVeterans and staff alike at the West Texas VA Medical Center agree that the tent city has already done more than enough to help put an end to the troubled history surrounding the Department of Veterans Affairs. However, one benefit that seems to stand out among the rest is the ability for veterans to come and go as they please without losing their place on the waiting list.

Republican Senator Ted Cruz announced his bid for the White House today in a speech delivered during a student convocation at Liberty University, the largest Christian university in the world, located in Lynchburg, Virginia. Senator Cruz spoke before a packed auditorium, saying he wants to reignite the promise of America.\nFollowing the first of many standing ovations, Mr. Cruz, who is a vocal opponent of Obamas immigration policies, told the evangelical audience that if he is elected President he will rebuild American immigration policy from the ground up. To start, the senator said he will immediately halt Obamas proposed plan to grant amnesty to the roughly 20 million undocumented aliens currently residing in the United States.\nBack in 2012 Senator Cruz said he would support deploying American troops along the U.S.-Mexican border, but today he laid out a new plan for border security, one that he says will significantly reduce the cost to American taxpayers. The first phase of the senators immigration strategy, following the liquidation of the amnesty program, is to mine the 1,989 mile long border between the U.S. and Mexico. Weve got over eleven million land mines sitting in storage, paid for by taxpayers like yourselves, Cruz told the audience, adding, Its time we put them to use.\nIn 1997 the United States signed the Convention on the Prohibition and Use, Stockpiling, Production, and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and On Their Destruction, otherwise known as the Mine Ban Treaty. However, the U.S. continues to maintain a stockpile of an estimated 11.3 million anti-personnel mines and has admitted to deploying a number of them along the DMZ that separates North and South Korea.\nSenator Cruz said the deployment of mines along the border would help free up manpower for other national security issues and also serve as a deterrent to those who might be planning to cross into the United States illegally. If we grant people citizenship who came here illegally, Cruz told supporters, were doing a disservice to others, people like my father, Rafael Bienvenido Cruz, who did the right thing by coming here legally.\nThe senators 74-year-old father, Rafael, immigrated to the United States from Cuba in 1957. Prior to a short stint in a Cuban prison, Rafael Cruz fought with Fidel Castros communist forces against the U.S.-backed Cuban government.

Using satellite imagery obtained from the National Reconnaissance Office, Dr. Martinez and his team were able to map the flow of illegal immigrants into the United States over a ten-year period. What weve seen is an incremental increase of twenty-three per cent over the last decade in the flow of undocumented individuals crossing over our southern border.\nThe U.S. Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will reach just over 345 million people by 2025. However, according to Dr. Martinez, the current data doesnt factor in the millions of undocumented persons arriving in the United States each year. Our models show that if this trend continues, the population of the United States by 2025 will reach approximately 621 million with just under forty-nine per cent consisting of American citizens, Martinez explained, adding that the data is offset by a 2% margin of error.\nIn contrast, the population of Mexico, which currently rests at about 126.3 million, is expected to shrink drastically over the next ten years due, in part, to rapidly changing climates and the countrys ongoing internal conflict with violent drug traffickers. Mexicans -as weve seen over the last quarter century  have already begun to emigrate north into the U.S. and Canada, said Luis Garcia, a third-year statistics major at MIT who serves as an assistant to Dr. Martinez. These numbers, while relatively small, are expected to rise exponentially over the next four decades.\nGarcias data shows that by 2050, a number of Central and South American countries including Colombia, Mexico, and Peru, could see their populations dwindle below 2.5 million.

However, according to the NRAs Executive Vice President, Wayne LaPierre, The Javelin, by definition, meets all the characteristics of a rifle. Its a shoulder-fired weapon that fires a single projectile.\nJust because the single projectile happens to be a 127-millimeter high explosive warhead with an automatic self-guidance system, proponents say the Javelin, like other large-bore rifles in its class, is prone to unfair discrimination. Everythings bigger in Texas, explained Gov. Abbott. Especially our guns. The governor boasted that he personally owns two Javelin Portable Anti-Tank Missile rifles.

Lawyers representing Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dozhokhar Tsarnaev filed a civil suit against the Watertown Police Department during a hearing at the Boston Municipal Court this morning. Citing Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act, the suit alleges Waterford police used excessive force leading up to and during the apprehension of Tsarnaev. The 21-year-old is facing thirty charges for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and conspiracy to bomb a place of public use resulting in death.\nLionel Hutz, the lead attorney handling Tsarnaevs case, spoke to reporters on the courthouse steps, saying,The Watertown police, and other law enforcement agencies, violated my clients civil rights countless times on the night of April 19th, 2013. Regardless of the charges levied against my client, he is an American citizen, and therefore innocent until proven guilty. Mr. Hutz said he intends to use police testimony from the federal trial against Tsarnaev to show what he calls an excessive and brutal use of force as a result of a heavily militarized law enforcement operation.\nTed Buckland, a member of Tsarnaevs defense team, told this reporter that in the moments leading up to his arrest, while Dozhokhar, who was unarmed, sought refuge inside the boat, officers from Watertown and other agencies unleashed a barrage of preemptive gunfire into the craft prior to deploying dozens of concussion grenades. Buckland says the defense team is seeking $150 million in punitive damages from the Watertown Police Department, part of which will be used to pay for Tsarnaevs defense in federal court.\nTsarnaevs defense team believes they have a rock solid case against Waterford PD. In the last decade weve seen an unprecedented rise in the use of excessive force against American citizens, particularly minorities. This case is no different from Ferguson where we had Michael Brown, an unarmed black teen, gunned down by an overzealous police officer, and the subsequent response to that was to deploy, basically, a militarized force into the city resulting in innumerable civil rights violations. Its simply unacceptable, Hutz says.\nDozhokhar Tsarnaev is being charged for his role in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing which killed 3 spectators and injured an estimated 264 people. In addition he faces charges for the murder of Sean A. Collier, an MIT police officer.

The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed, Alick declared as he unsheathed a two-meter long Japanese long sword that he vowed to carry alongside fellow GOP supporters at Julys convention.\nArena officials will release a full list of permitted weapons in the weeks leading up to the convention but according to Mr. Alick, attendees are allowed to bring anything from pocket knives to swords; sickles, spears, battle axes, and war scythes. However, for security reasons, blunt weapons, such as baseball bats and mace, are forbidden.\nThis is about exercising our constitutional rights, Ohio governor and GOP presidential candidate John Kasich told Megyn Kelly during an appearance on Fox News. That Obama and his Secret Service would deny us these fundamental rights while at the same time handing our tax dollars over to illegal immigrants and refugees is possibly the greatest injustice of the twenty-first century, Kasich said. The Ohio governor said he plans to bring a 7th century Merovingian two-handed battle-axe, on loan from the Smithsonian, to the convention.\nA spokesperson for the Secret Service released a statementon Tuesday regarding firearms at the Republican National Convention, saying, Individuals determined to be carrying firearms will not be allowed past a predetermined outer perimeter checkpoint, regardless of whether they possess a ticket to the event. However, as of Wednesday afternoon, the Secret Service had not yet taken a position on bladed weapons.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "CLEVELAND, Oh. \u2013 The Quicken Loans Arena \u2013 site of the upcoming 2016 Republican National Convention \u2013 has overruled a decision by the U.S. Secret Service to block attendees from openly carrying weapons at the event. \u201cThe American people have spoken and we will not allow their voice to be silenced,\u201d arena spokesman David Alick \u2026"}

A second grader in Pennsylvania has been expelled after a teacher caught him defacing an American flag during recess,The Waynesboro Record Heraldreported on Friday.\nThis kind of delinquent behavior is completely unacceptable and its something that we as a community simply will not tolerate, said Principal Willard Kraft of Hooversville Elementary School. Kraft said that shortly after lunch on Tuesday, October 18, an observant teacher found the student on the outskirts of the playground using a purple crayon, rather than a blue one, to color in an American flag hed drawn on a sheet of construction paper.\nWe were very lucky that none of the other children were exposed to it, said Kraft, who later referred to the illustration as a tasteless assault on American values. Kraft said the offensive sketch was immediately confiscated and the seven year-old boy was turned over to a school resource officer.\nWhile school officials had initially sought to suspend the juvenile, news of the defacement spread quickly and irate parents began phoning the school and calling for his immediate expulsion. The phones were ringing off the hook, Kraft recalled. Many students have parents who are veterans so this was something that hit close to home for a lot of folks.\nRetired U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Roger Harrison is one of those folks. Harrison, whose son Chester is enrolled in the fourth grade at Hooversville, said hes pleased with the schools decision to expel the boy. If you ask me, the little s*** got off easy, Harrison told Real News Right Now. Where I come from, flag desecration is a crime; it dont matter how old you are.\nOthers, like child psychologist Dr. Nancy Weiner, say such behavioral problems are often a sign of deeper and more complex issues. This was a cry for help, Dr. Weiner explained. This hapless child was reaching out in the only way he knew how.

A spokesperson for the Manitowoc District Attorneys Office announced on Tuesday that state prosecutors will appear in federal court this week to file first degree murder charges against Manitowoc resident Steven Avery. In light of new evidence, we believe Mr. Avery played a senior role in the shooting death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1968, said Ryan Peters, a spokesperson for the DAs office.\nProsecutors allege that Mr. Avery, who is already serving a life sentence at the Waupun Correctional Institution in southeastern Wisconsin for first degree murder, traveled to Memphis, Tennessee -even staying in the Lorraine Motel on two occasions, in the days and weeks leading up to the assassination of late civil rights leader. Mr. Avery played a key role in the planning and execution of this brazen act and its high time that justice is served, Mr. Peters said.\nAt the request of state prosecutors, Manitowoc County sheriffs deputies traveled to Tennessee on official orders last month where they recovered a plethora of DNA belonging to Steven Avery. Mr. Peters said investigators were primarily focused on room 306 of the Lorraine Motel where Dr. King was staying the day he was shot and killed. Investigators say the motel, which was converted into the National Civil Rights Museum in 2014, was awash with traces of Mr. Avery. Its like he was just there yesterday, Mr. Peters commented. The DNA, which is said to include skin and hair follicles, has since been turned over to the FBI and is undergoing testing at a forensics lab in Quantico, Virginia.\nIn addition, investigators have reexamined evidence obtained by the FBI in the days following Dr. Kings assassination. Included in the treasure trove of evidence are a set of binoculars and the .30-06 Winchester rifle that was used in the shooting. Following an intensive forensics analysis, Mr. Averys fingerprints were found not just on the trigger, but all over the weapon, said Mr. Peters, who added that Mr. Avery likely obtained the rifle through legal means.\nA representative for the Avery family told WBAY Action 2 News -a Wisconsin ABC affiliate, that contrary to the allegations made by Manitowoc prosecutors, Mr. Avery has never been to Tennessee. Hes never even left the state, the spokesperson said. Furthermore, Mr. Averys defense team, in a statement released Tuesday, argued that Mr. Avery couldnt have been involved in Dr. Kings assassination because at the time of the shooting he was barely six years old.\nHowever, Manitowoc County prosecutors say none of that matters. Such theories and coincidences are irrelevant to the investigation, said Peters when questioned by a reporter with the Green Bay Press Gazette. Were in the business of presenting facts and examining evidence. Thats how we solve cases.\nIf convicted, Mr. Avery could find himself facing an additional life sentence for the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The prominent civil rights leader was thirty-nine years old at the time of his death.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "\"In light of new evidence, we believe Mr. Avery played a senior role in the shooting death of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on April 4, 1968.\""}

Residents of Syria, a small town along Virginias Old Blue Ridge Turnpike, got an unexpected taste of Obamas drone war this weekend when five U.S. Air Force MQ-9 Reaper drones experienced a network glitch that caused their GPS and targeting systems to malfunction. The drones, each carrying a full payload and preprogrammed with a mission package and targeting data, were headed to Joint Base Andrews in Prince Georges County, Maryland for deployment to the Middle East.\nMeanwhile, Ed and Maude Hackell arrived at the U.S. Post Office on Old Blue Ridge Turnpike early Saturday morning to mail a card to their eleven year-old grandson in Des Moines, Iowa. Every month we send him a little money for his college fund, Maude later told WRLH-TV, Richmonds Fox affiliate. While Maude waited in the couples Buick, Ed went into the Post Office to buy a stamp. He was only in there for a minute or two, Maude said, wiping tears from her eyes. The elderly woman described feeling overwhelming heat and seeing a blinding flash before she lost consciousness.\nWhen she came to, Maude found herself bleeding from a head wound and trapped inside her overturned Buick which had been thrown more than a hundred yards from the post office parking lot. The post office itself, along with Ed and thirteen other patrons, was completely obliterated when a 500 pound GBU-38 smart bomb, known as a JDAM or Joint Direct Attack Munition, struck the facility. At the same time, vacationers staying at the Graves Mountain Lodge, located no more than half a mile from the Post Office, were desperately searching the rubble for signs of life after at least two AGM-88 HARM tactical air-to-surface missiles hit the family owned retreat.\nWilliam Buckley, a sixty-four year-old electrician, was driving south on Route 670 towards Rose River Farm when he spotted two Reaper drones flying low over Rose River. At first sight I thought they were RC airplanes, Buckley said. But then the unimaginable happened. The drones fired a volley of AGM-114 Hellfire missiles into the farm, destroying at least a dozen structures including several cabins, and killing sixty-three people. It was death from above, Buckley said.\nIn all, one hundred and ninety-three people, seventy-eight of them children, were killed in the drone strikes Saturday. The Department of Defense declared the event a national security incident and FEMA, while preventing media access to the town, has since taken over recovery efforts.\nPentagon officials declined to comment on the incident citing national security concerns, but a defense official with knowledge of the drone program, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Washington Post that, rather than a hardware malfunction, the tragedy may have been the result of human error. From above, the terrain is very similar to what were used to overseas, the official said, adding that many of the structures appeared run-down or dilapidated.\nLast Thursday the United States conducted its first successful drone strike against the Islamic State in Syria from the Incirlik joint air base near Adana, Turkey. Historically, only reconnaissance missions were flown out of Incirlik but earlier this month Turkey formally agreed to allow U.S. and other coalition fighter aircraft access to their bases.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Residents of Syria, Virginia got an unexpected taste of Obama's drone war when an unmanned drone's targeting systems malfunctioned this weekend."}

Beginning November 1st, U.S. military forces in Afghanistan will no longer be required to wear uniforms or display insignia identifying them as soldiers.

A large majority of Americans feel the best way to combat gun violence in this country is with more guns, Obama said. So weve decided to apply that same mindset to the war on terrorism.\nIn the words of Sun Tzu, To know your enemy, you must become your enemy, Defense Secretary Carter said. In early October, the Department of Defense quietly began shipping its existing fleet of Humvees and armored personnel carriers out of Afghanistan. From this point forward, our soldiers primary form of transportation in Afghanistan will be the Toyota Hilux, Carter said. He added the Pentagon has already purchased nearly 80,000 of the popular pickup trucks favored by the Taliban and Islamic State.\nDefense Secretary Carter said the United States is preparing to halt air and artillery support in Afghanistan as it rolls out its new Single-Use Precision Strike program, or SUPS, a ground-based all-volunteer tactical unit comprised of soldiers bearing the rank of Private First Class (E-3) or lower. These individuals are able to blend into the local population and inflict overwhelming psychological and physical damage to the enemy, Carter said. In addition to the honor bestowed upon SUPS volunteers for their selfless sacrifice, their surviving kin are entitled to a $50,000 bereavement bonus.\nPresident Obama said Justice Department lawyers and senior Pentagon officials have been working to alter the Rules of Engagement for U.S. troops serving in Afghanistan.

Documents released this week by whistle-blower website Wikileaks.org include a startling revelation about Edward Snowden that could threaten already shaky relations between the United States and Russia. The bundle of classified documents, reaching just over 15,000 pages, contains cables and internal documents from multiple U.S. and international intelligence agencies including the NSA and Britains MI5.\nIncluded in the files are dozens of documents linked to operation STARGAZR, a multinational task force set to defend Earth from intergalactic threats. Operation STARGAZR was first made public early last month by Real News, Right Now in an articlefeatured on this site.\nSeveral documents referencing operation STARGAZR point specifically to the existence of two unidentified satellites currently orbiting Earth. In a diplomatic cable designated TOP SECRET between a high-ranking official in South Korean military intelligence and the National Security Agency, an NSA official states attempts were made by USAF to shoot down SAT1 but failed due to highly advanced countermeasures deployed by the object.\nIt remains unclear exactly what those countermeasures were and if they resulted in any loss of life. Amid growing speculation, the Obama Administration has shown a staunch refusal to even acknowledge operation STARGAZR since the story first broke February 6.\nAlso contained in the leak are financial statements indicating former CIA system administrator Edward Snowden has been receiving monthly deposits from the National Security Agency. The deposits date back as far as May 15th, 2013, just five days before Snowden left Hawaii for Hong Kong, where he would release classified material to journalists.\nThis is not a mistake, says Retired U.S. Air Force General Buck Turgidson, who worked with the NSA from 1999 until late 2005. We have monthly transfers in the amount of $7,000, originating from a NSA front company, which typically pass through at least three financial institutions before arriving in a checking account operated by Edward Snowden.\nThe Obama Administration declined to comment on the transactions, saying it would not discuss classified material. However, General Turgidson, who helped design the PRISM program in its early stages, believes Snowden could be a double agent. I think the NSA deliberately leaked those files, Turgidson says, referring to the PRISM surveillance program, and they did so using Edward Snowden.What were seeing here is only the tip of the iceberg.", "section": "World News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Documents released by whistle-blower website Wikileaks.org include a startling revelation about Edward Snowden."}

At least twenty-six people were hospitalized last month following a brawl between Boston police and Massachusetts State Troopers outside of a Whole Foods in downtown Boston. Witnesses say at least two officers with the Boston Police Department accosted a State Trooper as he exited the Whole Foods on Cambridge Street. One officer allegedly told the trooper, Go back to f****** Framingham, you c***, before ripping the troopers groceries from his hands and hurling them into the street.\nShoppers and Whole Foods employees watched in horror as the two officers began beating and kicking the trooper, all the while screaming obscenities at him, until he collapsed on the pavement. Miraculously, the trooper was able to call for backup before losing consciousness. Massachusetts State Troopers attempted to defuse the situation but were overwhelmed when a Boston Police Special Operations Unit arrived on scene and began firing rubber bullets and tear gas in the direction of the troopers. In all, seven troopers and nineteen bystanders were treated by paramedics for non-life threatening injuries.\nOver the last decade weve witnessed the rise of a disturbing and often unreported trend in the law enforcement community, said Dr. Carl Gapinski, a former LAPD detective and criminologist. These encounters are happening all over the country but are most prevalent in departments that have received military-grade weapons and hardware from the Pentagon. Dr. Gapinski said a variety of factors contribute to the surge in police violence but available data suggests jurisdiction disputes or turf wars are the primary cause.\nJust outside the nations capital, in April of this year, two Fairfax County police officers shot and killed an Arlington County police detective after he initiated a traffic stop less than a quarter of a mile outside of his jurisdiction. Following light media attention, both officers were immediately placed on paid leave, however no charges were filed and one officer was later promoted.\nIn another incident, this time in Florida, a Coral Gables SWAT team carried out what authorities later described as a late-night no-knock drug raid on a rival police department four days after losing a state-funded softball tournament. During the raid, Coral Gables police utilized a Mine-Resistant Armored Personnel vehicle (MRAP) to breach the rival departments main entrance before firing tear gas and stun grenades into the building using Department of Defense-issued shoulder-fired grenade launchers.\nThis militarized mindset coupled with high testosterone levels creates a dangerous environment that, as weve seen time and time again, can easily escalate beyond the walls of the department, said former FBI Special Agent Ricardo Gutierrez. According to the FBIs 2014 Uniform Crime Report, nearly 1 in 10 American police officers engaged in some form of aggressive action against officers from another department that year. As more and more police departments across the United States begin to embrace a militarized version of law enforcement, Gutierrez said, those numbers will continue to grow.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Many U.S. Cities are reporting a surge in violence within the law enforcement community."}

During the stop, officers learned that Roberts had a warrant out for his arrest for the murder of his wife and three children whose dismembered bodies were found wrapped in a plastic tarp in the Willamette River.\nPolice immediately called for backup and ordered Roberts to exit the vehicle with his hands in the air. As the arresting officer approached the vehicle to take Mr. Roberts into custody, he stepped on a section of loose pavement and subsequently lost his balance. As a result, the officers weapon discharged, striking Roberts in the foot, Chief Turner said. Police promptly began administering first aid to Roberts until an ambulance arrived to transport him to an area hospital.\nDavid Hazzard, Jr., Roberts defense attorney, told theEugene Weekly that his client will not file charges against the Eugene Police Department or the officer responsible for the shooting.

A spokesperson for the District Attorneys office confirmed toReal News Right Now that the charges levied against Mr. Roberts have been reduced from first degree murder to negligent homicide.\nRoberts isnt the first motorist to be shot by police this week. On Friday, officers in Tulsa, Oklahoma, shot and killed Terence Crutcher, an unarmed African-American man, who had stopped his vehicle after experiencing car trouble.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth District has ordered Marriott International, an American diversified hospitality company, to remove pinhole cameras installed in shower-heads from all of its U.S. properties by early 2016.\nThe ruling reverses a previous decision by Judge Stephen K. Schmidt of the U.S. District Court of Nevada, who ruled in favor of Marriotts use of the cameras. The company has utilized the closed circuit cameras for liability purposes since 2006, following an unsuccessful lawsuit filed by an elderly guest who was knocked unconscious after falling in the shower.\nRay Cutler, an attorney for Marriott International, says the company has already filed an appeal and will fight the decision. This sets a dangerous precedent for hotels and the service industry as a whole, where the customers well-being falls under the responsibility of the proprietor, Cutler said.\nMost hotels dont disclose the existence or location of in-room CCTV cameras out of fear of backlash from their customer base but, according to Cutler, the practice is done purely from a safety and security standpoint. In some locations overseas, such as Asian or Eastern European countries, Cutler said, Its not uncommon to have these cameras installed throughout the room. They arent restricted to the bathroom. In fact, many host governments require the use of in-room closed circuit monitoring. Its a requirement to operate a business over there.\nAttorneys representing Hilton and Starwood Hotels said both hospitality companies have filed similar suits appealing the courts decision. Its standard practice in the industry, Vikramijit Singh, a travel agent who works for Expedia, told this reporter, adding, Everyone does it.\nMarriott has until January of 2016 to remove the closed-circuit cameras from its U.S. locations.

An Indiana man who had a recent near-death experience after tragic car accident left him in a coma says he made a shocking discovery during a brief trip to the afterlife. Forty-eight year-old Thomas Miller of Fort Wayne, who sustained a traumatic brain injury and lost both his legs after a head-on collision with a tractor-trailer, called the experience a turning point in his life. Its really put things into perspective for me, Miller told WFFT News, a local Fox affiliate.\nImmediately after the crash, Miller described being wrapped in a blanket of warmth and feeling his body rise through the mangled remains of his Toyota Prius and up into the sky by a loving presence. But Miller says once he passed through the pearly gates, things took a nasty turn. There were dinosaurs everywhere, an emotional Miller told WFFT. Some were as tall as buildings and they were just killing and eating everyone. There was so much chaos; so much destruction.\nDr. Brian Rosenbaum, a neurologist at St. Joseph Hospital in Fort Wayne, says its common for people who have suffered a traumatic brain injury to experience vision-like dreams. To put it simply, when you have a multi-sensory disintegration occur at the temporoparietal junction, the result is a disruption of various cognitive functions that regulate the brains ability to self-process, Rosenbaum explained. This is when people might believe they are having a so-called near-death experience.\nHowever, Miller is certain his experience wasnt the result of a disruption of his cognitive functions. I personally witnessed a pack of velociraptors chase down a group of angels and tear them limb from limb, he told WFFT News. It was hands down the most horrific thing Ive ever seen in my life. Miller, who considers himself a devout Catholic, said the Heaven depicted in the bible is a total war zone. I just cant wrap my head around how something like this is possible.\nFortunately for Miller, Father Robert Parsons of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis might have an answer. Several years ago, His Holiness Pope Francis declared that all of Gods creatures have a place in the Kingdom of Heaven, Father Parsons toldReal News Right Now. In the event this proclamation extends to the dinosaurs  and there is no evidence it doesnt  then we must assume there are millions of them in Heaven. After all, these creatures ruled the earth for nearly sixty-five million years.\nAs far as Thomas Miller is concerned, Father Parsons explanation offers little in the way of comfort. After his experience, Miller says the concept of life after death no longer holds any appeal. Even so, I keep playing the events over and over in my mind, he said. The last thing I remember was Saint Peter grabbing me by the collar, shaking me, and yelling, Stop sending people here, its not safe!

This is a proud moment for the Turkish people, said Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, speaking to reporters from the steps of the Harry S.

In an exclusive interview with former NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams, ex-president George W. Bush spoke at his ranch in Crawford, Texas this week about adjusting to life post-presidency and discussed a variety of topics including the reopening of the U.S. embassy in Cuba, Osama bin Laden, and his involvement in the attacks in New York and Washington on September 11th, 2001.\nYou often hear people say Bush did 9/11. Thats just not true, the 43rd president told Williams. I was only a pawn; a foot-soldier of sorts. Bush, while downplaying his role in the tragedy, said the events in their entirety were orchestrated by the Illuminati. These guys are involved in what they call a multi-century power struggle with the Reptilians, Bush said. They want to achieve world-domination.\nOn the night of September 10th, less than twelve hours before American Airlines Flight 11 struck the north tower of the World Trade Center, the Bush administration, acting on orders from the Illuminati, sent a twelve-man team into the WTC to plant thermite charges on the north and south towers steel support beams. Immediately following the conclusion of the operation, the team, according to Bush, was disposed of by FEMA.\nWhen asked by Mr. Williams if the former president thought he may be putting his life at risk by bringing such earth-shattering allegations to light, Bush replied, Absolutely, Brian. But I cannot, in good conscience, stay silent on this. Bush said hed hired a foreign private military contractor who was providing a sizable non-Jewish force to protect his ranch.\nIn response to a question by Williams as to al Qaedas involvement in 9/11, Bush said the Islamic terror group was merely a scapegoat. Calling al Qaeda a rag-tag band of extremists, Bush said the group was used to justify the War on Terror, which the Illuminati used as a means to covertly root out Reptilian operatives. As for the death of Osama bin Laden at the hands of SEAL Team Six on May 2nd, 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the former two-term president shrugged and said, Wheres the body?\nSwitching topics, Williams brought up Hurricane Katrina. As you know, I won a Peabody Award for my coverage of the situation while embedded with the National Guard on the harsh streets of New Orleans. At one point, I remember very clearly, we came under heavy machine gun fire in the French Quarter. What happened there? Williams asked.\nBush, who paused before offering a response, said, Brian, Im gonna level with you. The Reptilians were responsible for Hurricane Katrina. The ex-president hesitated before continuing, You know, its not that I dont care about black people; at the time I was trying to prevent another 9/11. Bush went on to say that had his administration provided a quicker and more efficiently managed response in the aftermath of Katrina, he would have effectively thrown the United States into war with the Reptilians. I could not put the American people in that position.\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Bush said, he has tried unsuccessfully to reach out to Edward Snowden. The former president said he believes Snowden, an ex-CIA contractor and whistle-blower, could help facilitate his safe passage to Russia where he intends to seek refuge from the Illuminati. Neither they nor the Reptilians have ever infiltrated the Kremlin, Mr. Bush said, adding, Its the safest place on earth.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "In an exclusive interview with MSNBC's Brian Williams, George W.

Palin described a moment of intense terror as she and Todd huddled together inside the small blast-resistant room, meanwhile rampant hooting and hollering could be heard from outside.\nBy the time Wasilla police had arrived at the Palin residence, the gang had vanished, leaving a chaotic scene of destruction in their wake. A spokesperson for the Wasilla police department told theMat-Su Valley Frontiersmanthat vandals had peppered the Palin compound with upwards of fifty dozen eggs. This was a well-coordinated attack, a source close to the Palin family told Fox News. What we know so far is that these individuals were well-trained and well-equipped. This was by no means amateur hour.\nPalin told authorities she initially believed the mob had been sent to silence her. They were here to suppress the voice of reason, she later charged on Facebook. These thugs were paid by the Obama administration to divide our nation. Palin went on to compare her experience to the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, lost their lives.\nAs of Monday evening, Wasilla authorities were still investigating a number of leads including a tip from the owner of a local grocery store who said hed sold a group of local kids approximately two hundred dollars worth of eggs less than an hour before the attack took place. This is the most credible information we have so far, Wasillas interim police chief Larry Dickerson said.\nDespite Chief Dickersons confidence that the matter would soon be resolved, Palin called the grocery store owners account a coincidence.

As Americans, we insist that nobody should be targeted because of who they are, or what they look like, who they love, how they worship. We stand united against these hateful acts.\nThe executive order is the 209th issued by President Obama since taking office and is being hailed as a major victory against racism. Based largely on Germanys anti-Nazi laws, the order, which officially goes into effect on June 18th, makes it illegal to possess any item or symbol bearing the sign of the Confederacy. President Obama, calling the Confederate flag a symbol of hatred, compared its history to that off the Third Reich, saying, You dont see government buildings in Germany flying the Nazi flag, we shouldnt have to see the Confederate flag here.\nAlso included in the executive order is an amendment to 18 U.S. Code 249, allowing for any individual or entity found to be in violation of the law to be prosecuted under the federal hate crimes statute. Under federal law, the punishment carries a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. In light of recent events, Im inclined to believe a ten-year sentence is far too lenient, Al Sharpton told CNNs Wolf Blitzer today. Blitzer, who agreed with Sharpton, said many in Washington have echoed similar sentiment.\nUnder orders from the White House, the Department of Justice, while working in conjunction with local and state law enforcement agencies, will, in the coming weeks, launch a nationwide operation to halt manufacturing and distribution of the soon-to-be-illegal contraband.

The U.S. Department of Justice handed three former U.S. soldiers over to the International Criminal Court at the Hague Friday evening. Former Army Lieutenant James Steven Patterson, Corporal Joseph Griffin, and Private Mike Slauson are scheduled to appear before the ICC Monday morning where they will face war crimes charges for acts allegedly committed during Operation Iraqi Freedom.\nChief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, attorney Klaus Mueller, spoke with reporters Friday afternoon, saying, We find crimes committed during war to be particularly heinous, therefore it is our duty to see that justice is swiftly served, he said, adding, We have a very strong case against these three men.\nCourt records allege that on 8 July 2007 Army Lieutenant James Patterson and Private Mike Slauson were traveling in two United States Army Humvees going southbound on Saadoun Street toward Firdos Square in central Baghdad. Witnesses state both vehicles were traveling well above the posted speed limit as they approached a four-way intersection clearly marked with traffic signals. As they approached the intersection, Lieutenant Patterson and Private Slauson directed their Humvees into oncoming traffic and plowed through the intersection at excessive speeds, during which Pattersons Humvee struck another vehicle traveling perpendicular to it, causing it to impact two other vehicles.\nThe documents go on to say that despite hitting another vehicle, both Patterson and Slauson sped through the intersection without stopping. As a resultfour civilian vehicles were damaged and eleven people injured, including a sixty-seven year old Iraqi woman who suffered a concussion and was taken to a hospital by ambulance.\nLt. James Patterson and Pvt. Slauson are each facing three counts of war crimes. The specific charges include reckless driving, failure to stop at a stop sign, and fleeing the scene of an accident. If convicted, both men could serve up to thirty days in jail. We intend to prosecute them to the fullest extent of the law and provide the Iraqi people with the justice they so desperately seek, Mueller said.\nAdditionally, Corporal Joseph Griffin is facing one count, with the charge of littering. Court documents allege Griffin threw a plastic bag containing roughly a dozen empty water bottles onto the roadside from the turret of an M1 Abrams tank he was riding in. If convicted he will be required to pay a fine of $500 to the Iraqi Ministry of Interior.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Former Army Lieutenant Patterson, Corporal Griffin, and Private Slauson will appear before the ICC Monday morning where they will face war crimes charges."}

The New York Department of Corrections and Community Supervision announced today that it will start the first round of testing this week for a soon-to-be nationwide program meant to deter repeat offenders from committing future crimes. The new program, known as Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy, is modeled after the three-drug combination which many states use against those condemned to die by lethal injection.\nAs of Monday, New York Citys main jail complex, known as Rikers Island, will become the first U.S. prison to implement Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy. The prisons North Infirmary now houses several rehabilitation chambers similar in design to the execution chamber at San Quentin State Prison in California.\nFollowing intake, inmates deemed eligible for rehabilitation therapy undergo a brief psychological evaluation before being transferred to the infirmary ward, said Assistant Deputy Warden James L. Rosa. Eligibility is determined based on any prior convictions the inmate might have and whether or not theyve previously served time in a New York state correctional facility, Rosa explained.\nOnce prison officials have deemed an inmate eligible for Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy, they are transferred to the rehabilitation chamber where they are strapped down on a gurney while specially trained members of the infirmary staff prep them for the procedure. The reason you often hear this process referred to as less lethal injection is because its quite simply that. Once the drugs are administered, the inmate is immediately subjected to incomprehensible pain, Assistant Deputy Warden Rosa said. The procedure is meant to simulate imminent death, he continued. The desired outcome, of course, is that the experience will leave the inmate with a renewed desire to abandon a life of crime all together.\nThe main difference between Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy and lethal injection, according to Dr. Jay Goldberg, the programs founder, is the elimination of pentobarbital. In 2010, pentobarbital replaced sodium thiopentalas the first drug administered during the execution process. Pentobarbital is an ultra-fast acting drug that, upon injection, renders the recipient into a medically induced coma within a matter of seconds.\nWhat weve done is remove the anesthetic aspect from the equation, Dr. Goldberg said, continuing, The patient is completely awake and alert throughout the entire procedure. Prison staff then administer an injection of pancuronium bromide, a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant which induces moderate paralysis of the respiratory system and simulates suffocation. This is immediately followed by a second injection of potassium chloride which affects the electrical conduction of the heart muscle.\nUnder normal circumstances, this combination would result in a total collapse of the respiratory system followed by a massive cardiac arrest and subsequent death, Dr. Goldberg explained. But for the purpose of rehabilitation, were administering a non-lethal dose. Dr. Goldberg would not disclose the specific dosage used for each drug but said preliminary testing on lab rats proved the dosages to be non fatal in eight out of ten cases.\nDr. Goldberg stressed that Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy was designed to performed on inmates who are considered by the state to be repeat offenders. The idea is that our program will prevent recidivism. Habitual offenders will be far less likely to continue down a path of self-destruction after experiencing Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy, Dr. Goldberg predicted. In essence, it gives many offenders a firsthand look at what for so many others is a last stop: the execution chamber. But unlike so many others, these inmates will receive a second chance to do the right thing.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Known as Chemical Rehabilitation Therapy, it is modeled after the three-drug combination which many states use for lethal injection."}

Recently suspended NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams is being hailed a hero for actions he took during an apartment fire last Thursday in which 22 people were injured and at least 2 are still missing. The seven-alarm fire occurred on Second Avenue and was the result of an explosion. The aftermath left three buildings destroyed and a fourth severely damaged.\nManhattan resident Keith Ramsay, who witnessed the fire, told ABC News he spotted Brian Williams on the sidewalk across the street from the blaze. He was wearing a reddish-brown track suit and, I think, drinking a latte, Ramsay recalled. Moments later, Williams personally recounted to ABC News, I heard screams coming from inside the building and was overcome with a sense of urgency to act. Drawing on my experience as a volunteer firefighter, I rushed toward the inferno. I was able to use a metal trashcan lid to break a window before hurling myself into the building. I distinctly remember the hotness of the air as dense smoke engulfed me. Several minutes passed before Williams emerged from the blaze, covered in a thick layer of ash and carrying three young children in his arms.\nThis reporter spoke with Brian Williams in a phone interview Saturday night, in which the suspended news anchor recalled what he saw inside the towering inferno. As I was going room to room, trying to locate these terrified children, I was seeing things of a suspicious nature. Things like rubber tubing, broken glass beakers, and empty packages of cold medicine littered the floor. Speaking as a veteran journalist, it was clear to me that this fire was the direct result of a meth lab explosion.\nThe New York City Fire Department has not confirmed or denied Williams allegations that the fire was linked to an existing methamphetamine lab in 121 Second Avenue. Instead investigators are looking at a blast of gas which erupted from a corrupt gas line somewhere in the building as the cause of the seven-alarm fire.\nSpeaking with George Stephanopoulos this morning on ABCs This Week, Brian Williams detailed the events leading up to the harrowing rescue. We were flying low over the city, coming up from the south above Second Ave in a U.S. Navy Black Hawk helicopter. I was embedded with six members of SEAL Team Four and we were en route to 121 Second Avenue, where intelligence assets on the ground had identified an ISIS bomb making operation.\nBy the time the helicopter reached 121 Second Avenue, the building was already in flames. The chopper hovered over the rooftop  I remember feeling the cold New York air on my face as the Black Hawks side doors rolled open -allowing just enough time for members of SEAL Team Four and myself to rappel onto the roof. Williams, who appeared on This Week wearing a bulletproof PRESS vest and a Kevlar helmet with a mounted GoPro camera, told Stephanopoulos the SEAL team used a satchel charge to blow a hole in the buildings roof before dropping down into the fifth floor.\nWe went floor by floor in search of the elusive ISIS bomb makers, all the while battling extreme heat and choking smoke. At one point we lost a member of the SEAL team whos name I cant reveal due to matters of national security- we lost him when the staircase he was standing on became engulfed in flames and collapsed. In the heat of the moment, my adrenaline pumping, I leapt towards the collapsed staircase, retrieving the fallen soldiers M4 assault rifle and pressed forward with the SEAL team.\nIn the end, Williams said no ISIS members were located in the raid. However, he credited himself with the successful rescue of six children from the blaze.

These despicable individuals have  for months  deliberately manipulated the publics perception with the sole purpose of turning a profit. Special Agent Greenwald said the FBI confiscated more than a dozen printing press machines which the suspects used to mass-produce fake newspapers before peddling them on street corners to unsuspecting New Yorkers.\nDescribing the operation as highly sophisticated, authorities said the perpetrators were able to produce thousands of knock-off newspapers per week at a cost of mere pennies, meanwhile netting upwards of $1.50 a pop for the illicit tabloids. They were making a killing, explained one law enforcement official who spoke toReal News Right Now on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Among the mountains of evidence seized during the raid, the official said FBI agents recovered tens of thousands of copies of a multi-page fake news publication titledThe New York Toast, a seemingly obvious imitation of the popular and widely circulatedNew York Post.\nHowever, according to Special Agent Greenwald, the FBIs discovery of the illegal printing press operation is only the tip of the iceberg. During Tuesdays press conference, Greenwald produced what appeared to be a freshly printed copy ofThe Wall Street Journal. What youre looking at is a fake newspaper, explained Greenwald. Its not real. Indeed, the object was in fact a molded slab of plastic which, from a distance, resembled a real newspaper. Greenwald said the counterfeit item was one of nearly a quarter million fabrications that have been seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents over the past month.\nAuthorities described a disturbing hierarchy in the underground world of fake news where anonymous individuals and organizations  many of whom identify themselves by cryptic pseudonyms or aliases  compete for likes, views, and shares. Those with the most shares reign supreme, said Brian, a former fake news producer who spoke to Real News Right Nowon Tuesday.

An Ohio middle school teacher is being hailed a hero after alerting police to a possible ISIS bomb making operation in New York City on Wednesday. Forty-one year-old Judith Harrington was taking her sisters black lab for a walk through downtown Manhattan when she encountered a suspicious device in an alley near Fifth Avenue. I wasnt exactly sure what it was, Judith told Fox 5 NY, but I had a feeling in my gut that it was meant to harm people.\nMinutes after Harrington called 911, a heavily armed NYPD emergency response team arrived on the scene and prepared to enter a nearby Syrian-owned business which police believed was linked to the suspicious device.Officers used a breaching charge to blow open the shops locked entrance before entering the building with their guns raised.\nOnce inside, police detained three employees who were found to be in possession of devices similar to the one reported by Mrs. Harrington. Members of the NYPDs bomb squad used a bomb-disposal robot to perform a controlled demolition of the devices prior to inspection.\nAuthorities later determined the devices -which turned out to be iPhones, were harmless. The iPhone is a high-end cellular phone popular in many parts of the world, including the Middle East. The Manhattan shop that sells the devices, known simply as the Apple Store, is one of thousands across the United States and is owned by Apple, the same company that produces the iPhone.\nHowever, authorities say the founder of Apple, a man by the name of Steve Jobs, is the son of a Syrian migrant. Were currently looking into this information, said FBI Special Agent Addison Brewer, who added, Looking at this from a national security perspective, its hard to imagine why an individual of Syrian descent would choose to open an electronics shop in New York City.\nSpecial Agent Brewer noted that Jobs father is from the Syrian city of Aleppo, a major supply point for the Islamic State.\nNew York Citys mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at a joint press conference with the NYPD, called Judith Harrington a hero for exhibiting quick thinking in the face of danger and presented her with a key to the city. The average American isnt an explosive ordnance expert, he said. I think youd be hard pressed to find anyone in this day and age who can positively tell a phone from a bomb.\nJim Boone, an iPhone user and Manhattan resident who witnessed the police raid, said he wasnt aware of Jobs Syrian heritage.

This is a huge victory, said Bo Kirkman.

What began as a low-key happy hour among coworkers last Thursday ended with one Secret Service agent dead, a second in jail, and the agency reeling fromyet another high profile scandal. According to the Metropolitan Police Department, about a dozen off-duty agents arrived at a popular steakhouse and bar near the Four Seasons hotel in Georgetown, shortly after 6:30 p.m. Saturday evening.\nBartender Woody Boyd, who served the agents, told FOX 5 DC the group was initially well-mannered and cordial but as the night progressed and the alcohol flowed, the groups atmosphere darkened. They got pretty rowdy, Boyd recalled. So much so that patrons around them started moving to other tables. Boyd said the agents were very vocal about their work, going out of their way to tell everyone around them that they were part of the presidents security detail.\nAccording to Boyd and others at the steakhouse Thursday night, it was around nine oclock when the agents engaged in a loud and heated discussion concerning official White House security protocols. I just remember hearing something about the safety of the presidents daughters, said a woman who spoke to FOX 5 DC on the condition of anonymity. Metropolitan Police investigators believe the alcohol-fueled discussion evolved into a rudimentary plan to test the integrity of White House security protocols by staging a mock kidnapping.\nOutdoor CCTV cameras at the Four Seasons show the agents left the restaurant at approximately 10:45 p.m., leaving behind an unpaid bar tab totaling over $1200. From there, investigators believe the heavily intoxicated agents drove straight to the White House where they bypassed security and attempted to infiltrate the presidential living quarters. Details at this point are sparse but it is believed the mock abduction failed before the agents could reach the First Daughters. All but two of the agents were detained by Uniformed Secret Service officers. Special Agents Samuel Fisher and Harry Tasker fled the White House grounds in two armored presidential limousines.\nApproximately seventeen minutes later, at 11:53 p.m., the two limousines were spotted by Maryland State Police heading north toward Rockville on I-270. Officers made several unsuccessful attempts to stop the vehicles and a chase ensued. A spokesman for the Maryland State Police, Captain Leon S. Kennedy, told reporters the following day, Certain modifications on these vehicles, such as bulletproof tires, hindered our ability to quickly and effectively pacify the situation. Captain Kennedy described the chase as chaotic, saying the armored limos reached speeds in excess of 120 mph and displayed a complete disregard for the safety of other drivers.\nA local news stations traffic chopper was passing over I-270 and caught the last few minutes of the chase on camera, which ended shortly after one of the armored limousines, driven by Special Agent Samuel Fisher, veered off the highway and slammed into a bridge embankment before exploding in flames. Captain Kennedy said the limo was going 109 mph when it impacted the concrete embankment. There was nothing left, he said.\nMinutes later, Maryland State Police were able to corner the second presidential limo and persuade Special Agent Tasker, albeit at gunpoint, to surrender peacefully. After failing a field sobriety test, Agent Tasker, a seven year veteran, told police he was on official business and involved in a mock kidnapping operation.\nThe Secret Service and the White House have remained mostly silent on the incident, with Secret Service Director Ethan Hunts office releasing a two sentence statement to the press saying the Service had recently conducted a training exercise.\nThis debacle comes prior to the arrest of a Secret Service officer Friday night for destruction of property and burglary after allegedly trying to break into a private home in the District. Additionally, a separate incident came to light early this month involving two Secret Service agents who were caught on surveillance video while driving drunk at the White House.

Speaking from the Pentagon Briefing Room, the commander of U.S. Central Command, General Lloyd Austin, told reporters the United States plans to scale back its initial goal of mustering a force of 5,000 rebel recruits per year to a more feasible thirteen.\nLower numbers mean a stricter screening process, which in the long run yields notably higher results, said General Austin, who added that U.S. forces have already trained five Syrian rebels so far this year. We are on track to have the remaining eight recruits combat-ready by late December, General Austin stated.\nIn 2014, Congress approved a budget of $500 million to train and arm Syrian rebels as part of a request for funding by the Obama administration to battle the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. General Austin said the Pentagons revised plan requires a fraction of the initial budget approved by Congress.  We foresee an annual budget of $100,000, General Austin said. This covers all costs associated with training, equipment, and logistics. Were looking at a total budget of $38.4 million over the next three hundred and eighty-four years.\nDefense officials are confident that with the revised strategy, the U.S. can deal a critical, if not fatal, blow to the Islamic State by 2399. We may not even have five thousand fighters alive by 2399 but we will have trained five thousand fighters by 2399 and that in itself will be a major victory for the United States, a defense official toldThe Wall Street Journal.\nIn early September, Russia began to significantly increase its military presence in Syria as part of its effort to boost al-Assads regime amid the countrys multi-sided civil war.

The White House and U.S. Capitol were evacuated today when an unidentified flying object entered restricted airspace above the nations capital. At approximately 10:21 a.m. local time, F-16 fighter jets left Joint Base Andrews in Southern Maryland to intercept the object, which, according to defense officials, did not show up on military or civilian radar.\nThe object was first spotted over Baltimore and subsequently reported to emergency services by some two hundred individuals, Major General Scott Borland of the U.S. Air Force told reporters during an emergency briefing at the Pentagon. At that time it was reported that the object was headed southwest in the direction of Washington D.C. Baltimore City Emergency Services immediately alerted NORAD, at which point three F-16s were scrambled out of Joint Base Andrews with orders to intercept the object.\nAccording to the Department of Defense and eye witnesses on the ground, a solid-black triangular-shaped object traveling at an extremely high rate of speed and emitting virtually no sound, entered restricted airspace above Washington, D.C. at approximately 10:27 a.m. EST. I watched it fly over the [National] mall and it slowed down so quickly, it was unbelievable, it was like it was just hovering there, Bethany Moss, a curator at the Museum of Natural History told Fox 5 DC. One second it was there and the next it just shot upwards into the sky and thats when we heard the fighter jets.\nMajor General Borland said that upon making contact with U.S. fighter jets, the object made several defensive maneuvers, which he described as being impossible for modern aircraft to achieve. When one of our pilots came within firing range, the object deployed a sort of high-energy laser weapon which disabled the F-16s flight control systems, causing it to crash. Immediately after, the remaining fighters lost contact with the object.\nA YouTube video uploaded by amateur photographer Shane Fager shows the F-16 hurdling through the sky and narrowly missing the roof of the John F. Kennedy Center before crashing into the Potomac River. The video, and many like it, which surfaced on YouTube just minutes after the event, show fighter jets buzzing the U.S. capital, but the unidentified object itself is, mysteriously, nowhere to be found.

On January 20, 2017, President-elect Donald J. Trump will be sworn in as Commander-in-Chief on the steps of the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. in what is slated to be the most extravagant presidential inauguration in recent history.\nOur intention is to create a very memorable and intoxicating experience for the millions of proud Americans who will make their way to our nations capital next month, said Ryan Clarke, an event coordinator and congressional aide to Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo), Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies. Mr. Clarke sat down with C-SPAN on Wednesday to discuss preparations for the inaugural parade and shed some much-needed light on what spectators can expect to see.\nThis year weve had the distinct pleasure of working with some really fantastic sponsors, Clarke said, continuing, One of our more prominent sponsors is the Ringling Brothers, so if youre a fan of the circus then youve come to the right place. Clarke said the traveling carnival company will play a major role in the historic ceremony, even going so far as to provide a thirteen-thousand pound elephant which President-elect Trump will ride from the White House to the inaugural ceremony at the Capitol.\nThis is the quintessential likeness of the Republican party, a visibly ecstatic Clarke told C-SPAN. The congressional aide said the president-elect has insisted on riding the enormous animal in lieu of carpooling to the Capitol building with the incumbent president  as is tradition.\nNothing about this ceremony is going to be traditional and thats the beauty of it, said Republican National Committee chairman and incoming White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. The American people have endured eight years of tradition and they are sick and tired of it. Mr. Priebus and the RNC have teamed up with World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE) to bring inaugural attendees  and the world  an exclusive one-of-a-kind post-ceremony show on the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol. Dubbed the Professional Wrestling Event of the Century by Pay-Per-View, the special event is set to begin immediately after Donald J. Trump is sworn in as the 45th President of the United States.\nFollowing the ceremony, the president will exit the inaugural platform and proceed down the Capitol steps to the West Lawn where he will be met by 2016 WWE Heavyweight Champion Triple H, WWE co-founder Linda McMahon told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday. The presumptive Small Business Administration secretary went on to say that the presidential heavyweight and his WWE counterpart will enter the ring and square off against two stuntmen dressed as President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Regardless of your feelings on the election, this is going to be an event that no American should miss, McMahon said.\nThe fifty-eighth U.S. Presidential Inauguration is set to begin at noon on Friday, January 20, 2017, in Washington, D.C. The Washington Metropolitan Police Department estimates between 800,000 and 1 million people will be present for the ceremony and accompanying parade.

The popular pancake topping isCanadas largest export andmakes up formore than 70% of the countrysgross domestic product. Since taking office less than forty days ago,Mr. Trudeau has more than tripled Canadas maple syrup production and, in the process, created more than seventy new jobs. Prime Minister Trudeau has done more for Canada in one month than Wayne Gretzky did in his entire career, boasted fellow Canadian William Shatner during a recent interview with The Toronto Star.\nPrime Minister Trudeau made national headlines againthis week when he traveled to Torontos Pearson International Airport topersonally greetmore thanone hundred and sixty Syrianswho had arrived seeking refuge from an increasingly dire humanitariancrisis in their war-torn nation. In Trudeaus own words, the decision to accept an estimated25,000 Syrian refugees was Canadas way of showing the world how to open our hearts.\nDespite Mr. Trudeaus perceived good intentions, the move has left asickly taste in the mouths ofmany Americans. That sort of thing wouldnt fly here in the United States, said George Allen, a seniorcampaign strategist for Texas Senator Ted Cruz.

In the wake of another mass shooting, this time in Kalamazoo, Michigan, when an Uber driver shot and killed six people over the weekend, President Barack Obama, speaking from the Oval Office on Wednesday, laid out his latest plan to curb gun violence in America, calling the new initiative a sensible incentive-based program.\nLargely based around past state-funded gun buyback-style programs, Obamas new plan, which goes into effect nationwide on March 2nd, gives Americans the choice to turn their weapons over to the federal government once a month on a no-questions-asked basis. Let me be clear, explained President Obama. No one is under any obligation, legal or otherwise, to participate in the program. This is a volunteer-only initiative.\nHowever, Obama continued, each American who chooses to take part in the program, regardless of criminal history, will receive a voucher for every firearm they turn over to the federal government. These vouchers, Obama explained, are electronically entered into a national lottery system created and implemented by this administration. At the end of each month well hold a nationally televised drawing to announce a winner.\nOn the first Tuesday of every month, starting in April of 2016, one lucky American will have the chance to sit in on a CIA drone operation where they will have the rare opportunity to assume command of a live drones remote firing controls and -under CIA supervision- execute a suspected terrorist. Citing national security concerns, the president said award winners will not be told the names or locations of the terror suspects who have been targeted for assassination. Youll simply be told when to fire, President Obama said.\nChris Rutherford, a fifty-one year-old registered Republican from Hattiesburg, Mississippi, toldFox Newsthat he cannot wait to enter into the national lottery. Im a proud Trump supporter and lifetime member of the NRA, Rutherford said, continuing, I own twelve guns including my grandfathers M1903 Springfield, and you better believe I plan to hand each and every one of them over to Mr. Obama.\nRutherford isnt the only one excited about Obamas gun buyback initiative. Sandra Glass, a mother of six from Austin, Texas, toldReal News Right Now that she intends to take out a second mortgage on her home so she can afford to buy enough guns to enter herself and her two oldest sons into the national lottery once a month. Consider it their high school graduation present, Mrs. Glass said with a chuckle.\nThe National Rifle Association has not yet issued a statement on the program but an NRA official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Washington Post that if there were ever a legitimate reason to give up your guns, this is it.\nThe complete terms and conditions of President Obamas national lottery program are expected to be outlined on the White Houses official websitelate next week. However, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest confirmed that the minimum number of firearms an individual needs to hand over to the government each month in order to be eligible for the lottery is one.\nRon Anderson, who sits on the board of the American Firearms Retailers Association, said he believes Obamas new initiative could be good for America. Its not something that directly infringes on our constitutional right to bear arms, Mr. Anderson said, adding that while the programs primary intention of curbing gun violence could be successful, the added incentive will likely cause gun sales to skyrocket.

Additionally, beginning July 2nd, Walmart locations across the country will liquidate any remaining American flags on-site in supervised controlled burns.\nIn order to make up for a projected loss in revenue ahead of Independence Day, Walmart plans to offer a fifty percent discount on British flags and related merchandise through the holiday weekend. Without the British, the United States of America, and Walmart for that matter, might never have existed, said Walmart CFO Jared Sterling. So its only fitting that we honor them this weekend. Sterling said Walmart headquarters, as well as its retail locations in and around the nations capital, will fly the British flag at half mast on July 4th.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Walmart has decided it will incinerate an estimated four hundred thousand American flags currently being held in its distribution centers."}

Hundreds of thousands of heavily armed bikers are set to converge on the nations capital this weekend to participate in an end-all turf war on the National Mall. The event is scheduled to coincide with the National Memorial Day Parade which begins at 2 p.m. on Monday, May 25th.\nU.S. Capitol Police say there will be an estimated two-hundred thousand guns, knives, billy clubs, pipes, boxcutters, chains, bats, hand grenades and axes in the District this weekend. With such a high concentration of hardened criminals in the nations capital, police say any attempts to prevent an altercation will be futile. Technically, theyre exercising their right to assemble, Captain Rory Daniels told CNN. Captain Daniels said Capitol police and local law enforcement will create a buffer zone around the National Mall separating the biker gangs from Memorial Day celebrations. This way everyone is happy, Daniels said.\nJade Anderson told CNNs Don Lemon that her husband, who is a member of the Bandidos motorcycle club, plans to avenge the deaths of his brothers who were killed outside the Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco, Texas this week with a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire and a hydraulic nail gun. Anderson described her husband as a loving father who is definitely not a criminal, and blamed the media for the negative portrayal of motorcycle organizations.\nThe president of the notorious Hells Angels Motorcycle Club, Bobby The Fist Mitchell, spoke with this reporter by phone, saying he is leading a procession of over twenty-three hundred of his roughest and toughest members to Washington to settle a longstanding blood feud with the Bandidos. Mitchell said he plans to eviscerate his rivals and fill the Reflecting Pool with their blood before climbing the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to declare victory.\nIn addition to the Bandidos and Hells Angels, a few of the more notable biker gangs making an appearance in Washington this weekend include the Monglols, the Pagans, the Pennsylvania Warlocks, the Scimitars, and the infamous Sons of Silence. Last but not least are the Cossacks, one of the more violent gangs involved in the bloody shootout that left nine bikers dead and dozens more injured outside a sports bar in Waco, Texas last Sunday.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "Hundreds of thousands of heavily armed bikers are set to converge on the nation's capital this Memorial Day for an end-all turf war on the National Mall."}

After a two thousand-year absence, the Lord and Savior of humanity, Jesus Christ, has returned to earth. Jesus, who many believe to be the Son of God, was crucified in 30 A.D. under Pontius Pilate, then leader of the Roman Empire. Prior to his death, Jesus told acquaintances that he intended to one day return to Earth to judge the living and the dead.\nRabbi Jacob Schram, of the Beth Israel Messianic Synagogue in Jacksonville, Florida, met with Jesus early Sunday morning amId a crowd of worshipers and local media. Jesus performed several miracles, including curing a nine-year-old girl of autism, before leading a prayer service for the synagogues worshipers. When asked why he was visiting a synagogue rather than a church, Christ said he was born and raised a Jew.\nSusan Ross, who attends Beth Israel Messianic Synagogue regularly and was among the worshipers who met Jesus Christ, spoke with News 4 Jacksonville, saying, Im just ecstatic that hes here! That were all here to witness history in the making. Ross, a 47 year-old single mother, added that Christ looked very good for his age.

Cooper then asked Jesus a series of questions in an effort to dispel thousand-year old myths and rumors surrounding the Christian faith. On the subject of gay marriage, Jesus said, Im fine with it. My father is fine with it. In fact, Anderson, its not in the bible, but two of my Apostles, John and Matthew, were homosexuals.\nIn response to a question regarding the Islamic State and growing concerns over the safety of Christians living in the Middle East, Jesus addressed ISIS directly, saying members of the Islamic State have the opportunity to be forgiven simply by laying down your weapons and accepting me as your Lord and Savior. However, Christ added his father is preparing to send an army of angels to eradicate evil from the planet.\nJesus Christ said his first order of business will be to judge the estimated 7.125 billion people currently alive on earth, a job which he says shouldnt take too long. Christ told Anderson Cooper hes not in a hurry to immediately judge the dead, saying, They arent going anywhere anytime soon.", "section": "U.S. News", "content_type": "article", "desc": "After a two thousand-year absence, the Lord and Savior of humanity, Jesus Christ, has returned to earth."}

Three people were killed and more than a dozen were injured Sunday evening after Secret Service agents tasked with protecting GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump opened fire on a group of protesters at the Sunset Cove Amphitheater in Palm Beach County.\nThe incident occurred moments after Trump, who was addressing a crowd of nearly twenty thousand enthusiastic supporters, ordered his security detail to put down a group of Latino protesters who were waving a homemade Were Not Rapists banner. These people make me sick, Trump declared minutes after his security detail had fired more than thirty-eight rounds into the group -later identified as students from Florida Atlantic University- killing two of them instantly.\nThe third individual, an eighteen year-old FAU freshman, was dragged unconscious through the crowd as Trump supporters violently kicked and beat him, many using bottles, lawn chairs, and anything they could get their hands on, as weapons. The Maryland native, who had been shot five times by Trumps security detail, later died due to significant blunt force injuries, according to the Palm Beach County Medical Examiner.\nAmid the chaos that followed, Donald Trump declared that Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders had sent his communist sympathizers here to sabotage our evening. As thousands of fervent supporters chanted Make America Great Again, Trump accused a man who was wearing a Marco Rubio t-shirt of inciting a riot and demanded his removal from the venue by any means necessary.\nAs he was escorted off the premises, dozens of Trump supporters savagely punched and spat on him, with many accusing him of being a member of the Islamic State. Go back to Iraq you f***ing sand******, screeched one woman before striking him in the face with the wooden end of her Trump placard.

However, following his experience, the man said he is most certainly voting for Hillary.\nDonald Trump told CNN hes not responsible for the violence that occurred at the Palm Beach rally on Sunday. These are people who deliberately came here with the intention of inciting violence, the GOP front-runner told Anderson Cooper. You saw this in Chicago and now youre seeing it here.
